The Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance believes naming heat waves will bring more attention to the threats they pose.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Frederic Larson/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But heat can present a more insidious threat, Baughman-McLeod said. "We call it the silent killer," she&nbsp;told <a href="http://cbc.ca/day6"><em><u>Day 6</u></em></a><em> </em>host Brent Bambury.</p>  <p>According to a <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125937/">recent study out of Duke University</a></u>, heat-related illnesses are responsible for more than 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.</p>  <p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control, meanwhile, puts that number at approximately 600. Baughman-McLeod says the lower number is likely the result of underreporting given many health record-keeping systems don't allow for heat-related mortality and morbidity in most places.</p>  <p>"Part of the challenge is that we don't keep records of heat-related illness and death, and oftentimes you would show up to the emergency room with a heat illness and it would be categorized as a kidney failure or a heart attack," she said.</p>  <h2>Protecting the most vulnerable</h2>  <p>Several cities — including Athens, Tel Aviv and Melbourne — and international climate organizations have signed on in support of the alliance's naming goal.</p>  <p>Those living in cities are more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Cities are built from materials that trap heat and lead to a "heat island effect" that can increase temperatures by up to 8 C, sayid&nbsp;Baughman-McLeod.</p>    <p>She believes that naming heat waves could help create measures that protect those most vulnerable to the heat, including those living in cities without access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down.</p>  <p>"Farm workers and delivery workers and construction workers ...&nbsp;wouldn't be expected to work during a named heat wave where they are," she said as an example.</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Area residents capture video along the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as the city's skies are blanketed with smog and debris from wildfires throughout the state.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:45</span></span></span></p>  <p>With a name, she argued, news and social media could more easily elevate awareness of a heat wave.</p>  <p>But not everyone agrees on what is considered extreme heat, a challenge Baughman-McLeod is aware of.</p>  <p>She says that for this to work, an international framework must be created. From there, regions will be able to adapt what is considered extreme to their own climate.</p>  <p>"It will be about local conditions and the people who live in those areas there, what they're used to," she said.</p>  <p>When the U.S.-based Weather Channel began naming winter storms, there was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74744/why-it-controversial-name-winter-storms">disagreement</a> among meteorologists and scientists. While Baughman-McLeod acknowledges that it has presented some challenges, she believes her group is working to develop the best framework.</p>  <p>"We are in discussions with those groups of scientists and researchers, applied scientists, climatologists, heat-health scientists, social scientists," she told <em>Day 6.</em></p>  <p>"We will 100 per cent depend on science- and data-informed strategy to get to heat wave naming."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Jason Vermes&nbsp;with files from The Associated Press.

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.
</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>
That's it! The network is ready to learn.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

CUDA, OpenCL, DNNL, Java, and Clojure</a> teaches the nuts and bolts of neural networks and deep learning
by showing you how Deep Diamond is built, <b>from scratch</b>? In interactive sessions. Each line of code
can be executed and the results inspected in the plain Clojure REPL. The best way to master something is to build
it yourself!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>Over the last few years we’ve been seeing an interesting case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a> playing out. The case is ARM, and how it through smartphones have grown from energy efficient but comparably slow CPUs, into something which is turning to an overall better choice for general use CPUs.</p>
<p>Looking at how Apple is moving to ARM in its computers, not just the iPhone, and how Amazon are using ARM in their cloud servers, it is clear that we’re very close to having ARM replace Intel across the board. Intel, on its side, have not managed to keep up, which, when viewed from the top of the S-curve, fits perfectly with what we’d expect to happen.</p>
<p>So with that, ARM is not just an interesting technology, but also an interesting business. It’s not surprising to see current interest in buying ARM. If and when that will happen remains to be seen, but to expect a new owner of ARM in the next few months is pretty clear in my view.</p>
<p>Whoever ends up owning ARM, Intel is in trouble no matter. They do not have an architecture which is capable of much further growth. It’s stagnant. I’m sure AMD can easily enough turn around and start selling ARM based CPUs, as they see that market growing. But for Intel to jump on the ARM path, that’s hard to imagine. There’s too much history tied to the x86 architecture for them to make that jump. So I’m not hopeful for Intel, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they almost end up dead in a few years.</p>
<p>But only then will they also be able to move forward, and that’s where I see <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> becoming interesting.</p>
<p>If we have Nvidia owning ARM, I concur with many others that, they probably will eventually <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/hermann-hauser-nvidia-destroy-arm">introduce too much friction</a>. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and maybe even Microsoft through Azure, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-arm-holdings-m-a-nvidia-industry-anal/nvidias-arm-deal-sparks-quick-backlash-in-chip-industry-idUKKBN2650GT">not to forget non-U.S. companies</a>, will become unhappy with their working relationship with Nvidia. </p>
<p>And because we at that point just recently switched from x86 to ARM, a new switch to RISC-V doesn’t seem that farfetched. Also, because ARM and RISC-V are both a RISC designs, you can argue its an easier switch than from the CISC design of the x86.</p>
<p>It’s at this point, with a new switch to RISC-V in 10 years or so, that Intel can jump back on the path to growth. If they can see this happening, and plan ahead, they could revive themselves through RISC-V.</p>
<p>RISC-V will remain an open source project, which would be a requirement from the industry, given their, at that point, lessons learned from ARM as owned by Nvidia. But open source projects need business backing to grow, and Intel could be one of those, as a significant member of a greater RISC-V community.</p>
<p>Time will tell..</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started being developed internally at Facebook back in 2012, before being publicly released as open-source in 2015. <strong>GraphQL is a query language for APIs</strong>, its main advantage is allowing clients to query exactly for the type of data that is required. The definitions of all the data clients can query through the service are stored in GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.</p>
<p>GraphQL is language-agnostic which makes it fairly easy to be adopted across different technologies, one of its successful implementations is done in Rust, by a library called Juniper.</p>
<h2>Code- first, fast &amp; type-safe GraphQL Servers in Rust</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a></strong> is a code-first approach that allows you to write <strong>type-safe and super fast GraphQL servers in Rust</strong>, keeping declaring and resolving GraphQL schemas as easy as possible.</p>
<p>GraphQL query language is fully supported, including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, validations, as well as some basic Rust crates integrations allowing you to use popular Rust types as <code>uuid</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>chrono</code>, or <code>bson</code> out of the box. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned <strong>Juniper is a code-first library</strong>, if you prefer the schema-first approach you can use <a href="https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-from-schema">juniper-from-schema</a> to <strong>auto-generate resolvers</strong> for your GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>Although Juniper does not provide a built-in web server functionality it comes with building blocks to make integration with your servers as seamless as possible, as well as optionally providing pre-built integration for popular Rust web frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actix,</li>
<li>Hyper,</li>
<li>Iron,</li>
<li>Rocket, </li>
<li>Warp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of Juniper integration for Actix</h2>
<p>Below you can find a sample Juniper integration with the <strong>Actix web framework</strong>. The servers run on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> and has built-in GraphiQL for easier testing. Star it with:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>cd examples/juniper

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/mexican_calendar_systems.jpg" alt="Confusing Mexican Calendar, at least for those not in the know" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Freetype, included in the <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">font stack on
Unix</a>, is quite
complex. There are so many layers to get it to do what it does that
it’s easy to get lost. From finding the font, to actually rendering it,
and everything in between.<br>
Like most of the world, I use a rather low screens definition
(1366x768 with 96 dpi) and rather old-ish laptop, unlike some <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/">font
designers that live in a filter bubble where everyone has the latest
macbook</a>. Thus, good and legible font
rendering is important.<br>
Let’s play with lesser known toggles available to us when it comes to font
rendering and see what they do, let’s have fun and explore possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="a-general-picture">A General Picture</h2>

<p>Generally, to make a font look better on screens, which are arrays of
pixels, we use a combination of these three:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Antialiasing</strong>: Applying a light shade around the glyph. It is useful
at small scale, when you don’t have enough pixels, but it makes most
glyphs look bolder.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_antialias.jpg" alt="Font anti-alias example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subpixel rendering</strong>: A technique similar to antialias but using
subpixels, the color components inside the pixels. By applying a
small amount of colors on the sides you can reach more granular
precision. However, if applied clumsily, or if you simply move the
window containing the text, these colored subpixels will become
apparent, what we call fringe.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_subpixel_rendering.jpg" alt="Font sub-pixel rendering example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hinting</strong>: Pixels are blocks but text is made of curves, that means
these curves will never match exactly with screen pixels. Hinting
is about repositioning or selecting the closest pixels while trying
as much as possible to keep the shape of the glyph intact. There are
multiple levels of hinting, hinting information provided by the font
itself (bytecode interpreter hinting), and hinting provided by the
rendering library (auto-hinting).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_hinting.jpg" alt="Font hinting example" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>NB</em>: “It’s just text”… This article is yet another that
shows how fonts aren’t as easy as they look.  For more info
about the font stack, please visit <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">my previous article on the
topic</a>, and if you
want an idea of what it means to draw them on the screen take a look a
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/09/02/fonts-xcb.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>What is applied, when, how to control all of this, can we see what they
do, and should we even care?</p>

<p>Freetype and fontconfig default rendering these days is pretty good,
so there shouldn’t be anything to worry about; Until there’s something
to worry about, like a font not looking the way you want.<br>
Our first stop will be something that intrigued me because I haven’t
heard many talk about it: the Freetype driver’s properties.<br>
The Freetype driver is used whenever hinting is needed, so this is the
part it actually changes — how hinting is applied.</p>



<p>Let’s start with arming ourselves with ways to easily test all this.<br>
Freetype2 demos utilities are a must, you can clone them
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/09/14/git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2-demos.git">here</a>
or fetch them from your package repositiory, for example
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/freetype2-demos">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2-demos/">Arch
Linux</a>.<br>
These will give you a bunch of useful tools such as <code>ftdiff</code>, <code>ftview</code>,
<code>ftstring</code> <code>ftgrid</code>, <code>fttimer</code>, <code>ftbench</code>, and others. The most important
ones for us are <code>ftdiff</code> and <code>ftgrid</code>.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 20 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftstring <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-m</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, you can install <code>pango-view</code> from <code>pango-tools</code>
to later test if fontconfig applies your configurations
properly. It can be used by preparing a file written in <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html">pango
markup</a>
and displaying it using <code>pango-view --markup file.pangpang</code>.<br>
You can set the fontconfig debug level higher to see which font is
actually loaded by setting the <code>FC_DEBUG</code> to something like 4096,
<code>FC_DEBUG=4096</code>.</p>

<p>More values can be found here, we’ll use them later to see if our
fontconfig settings are applied properly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="man">Name         Value    Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------
MATCH            1    Brief information about font matching
MATCHV           2    Extensive font matching information
EDIT             4    Monitor match/test/edit execution
FONTSET          8    Track loading of font information at startup
CACHE           16    Watch cache files being written
CACHEV          32    Extensive cache file writing information
PARSE           64    (no longer in use)
SCAN           128    Watch font files being scanned to build caches
SCANV          256    Verbose font file scanning information
MEMORY         512    Monitor fontconfig memory usage
CONFIG        1024    Monitor which config files are loaded
LANGSET       2048    Dump char sets used to construct lang values
MATCH2        4096    Display font-matching transformation in patterns</code></pre></figure>

<p>Yet another way is to test directly in your browser URL bar:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml">data:text/html,<span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf8"</span><span>&gt;&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"font-family: Times New Roman;"</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-freetype2-drivers-properties">The Freetype2 Drivers Properties</h2>

<p>So let’s get back to our testing of Freetype2 drivers.<br>
On <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-properties.html">this documentation
page</a>,
ft (freetype) properties are listed and are said to affect the behavior
of the drivers, each touching a different one. They are set by modifying
the <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment variable, normally loaded from
<code>/etc/profile.d/freetype2.sh</code>.<br>
However, most of the ones listed are targeted at the CFF, Type 1,
and CID fonts driver and not at TrueType fonts, so they do nothing
if you don’t have these font types. The only toggle <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-tt_driver.html">available for
TrueType</a>
is the <code>interpreter-version</code> which controls the bytecode interpreter,
the rasterizer, and thus how the outline gets hinted.</p>

<p>The options available to us are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 — For classic mode GDI (Win 98/2000)</li>
  <li>38 — GDI+ old (Vista, Win 7), Infinality, considered slow</li>
  <li>40 — For minimal mode (stripped down Infinality, this is the default)
(After Win 7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of weird that we jump from 35 to 38, where did 36 and the rest go? The
answer is that it’s a choice from the Freetype devs to only include those
and not the ones in between.</p>

<p>And the differences look as follows, notice the native hinter in the
left column:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftdiff_v35.png" alt="ftdiff interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 36 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v35.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=38"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftdiff_v38.png" alt="ftdiff interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=38"</span> ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 36 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v38.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v40</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=40"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftdiff_v40.png" alt="ftdiff interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=40"</span> ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 36 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v40.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We can also test using <code>pango-view</code> (remember again that this should be a font
that has native hinting enabled but not the auto-hinter):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;span</span> <span>font_family=</span><span>"Times New Roman"</span> <span>font=</span><span>"10"</span> <span>foreground=</span><span>"black"</span> <span>alpha=</span><span>"83%"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also change the font via the <code>--font=</code> argument of <code>pango-view</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> pango-view <span>--markup</span> text.bangarang</code></pre></figure>

<ul>

<p>So definitely, older interpreter versions were rougher with hinting, much
bolder, and could deform the glyphs. The newer ones are more minimal with
it. We also notice that the auto-hinter isn’t that bad and that avoiding
hinting can help. I took the specific case of the Windows font ‘Times New
Roman’ because it has the reputation of rendering badly with Freetype,
mostly because of the job the interpreter does. Applying very light or no
hinting at all helps tremendously, even at very small point size as you
can see in the next comparison. The hinting does indeed help legibility
at this scale but the font shape and personality is completely destroyed.</p>

<h2 id="how-fontconfig-works">How Fontconfig Works</h2>

<p>We’re not done with hinting yet, there can be many levels of hinting
that can be applied, but let’s first take a detour and learn a bit about
fontconfig and how to use it.</p>

<p>Fontconfig is the layer in the font stack responsible for loading the
font along with the configurations that tell the next layer how to find
the font file and what changes to apply when rendering it. It is usually
composed of a library, a preset of configuration files, and a bunch
of helpful tools all starting with the prefix <code>fc-</code> such as: <code>fc-cache</code>,
<code>fc-query</code>, <code>fc-match</code>, and <code>fc-conflist</code>, to name a few.</p>

<p>The configuration files are usually found in <code>/etc/fonts/</code> and split into
the presets available <code>/etc/fonts/conf.avail</code>, and the chosen presets in
<code>/etc/fonts/conf.d</code>, which are symbolic links to the former.<br>
The precedence of the rules is alphanumerical, a first-come
first-served principle, thus <code>01-custom-rule.conf</code> will be loaded
before <code>99-not-important-rule.conf</code>. Local user configurations, in
the user’s <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig</code> directory, are loaded from
one of these configurations that contains an include statement. On
my machine it is the <code>50-user.conf</code>, so it’s precedence is lower
than anything loaded before it. This isn’t practical when testing
rules so rename this file to something like <code>01-user.conf</code>. Now
anything you put in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d</code> or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> should have priority.<br>
You can make sure the order and configurations are loaded properly by
using the <code>fc-conflist</code> command. It lists in order of precedence the
configurations found, the ones starting with a <code>+</code> are loaded, the ones
with <code>-</code> are not.</p>

<p>These files are composed of mainly 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match rules: If something matches, then edit the properties
mentioned. There are ton of matching and editing rules, even including
stuff like the program name that is currently trying to load …</li></ul></article></div></div>

I was mystified when I first came across the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">“Most Inflationary”</a> winning
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/">entry</a> in the 2018 <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.  Written by the <a href="https://bellard.org/">incredibly prolific</a> Fabrice
Bellard, this tiny program with just 4KB of source code emitted a
128×128 resolution version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#Criticism">(in)famous</a> Lena test image.  Voodoo!
The IOCCC judges wrote “We could understand some of the arithmetic but none
of the magic.”  I was determined to figure out the magic and inspired by
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard</a> to try to write up how it works.
</p>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward enough, and both the source and the
details of running it can be found on its IOCCC page.  I used GCC to
compile it and piped the output directly to ImageMagick to view it:
</p>

<div>
<pre>gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
./prog | display -                        # Show embedded image
./prog d &lt; vintage_cars.bin | display -   # Show an external image
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running it with no arguments like the first case will decompress the
embedded data and produce the following image (zoomed for detail):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/image.png" alt="image.png">

</figure>

<p>
Admittedly, this has a fair number of compression artifacts, but it’s still
pretty darned impressive for 2439 bytes of image data and 1544 bytes of
source code for the decompressor.
</p>

<p>
So let’s see how it works.  This will be a deep dive and by far my longest
post yet (I’ve erred on the side of too much detail), so make
yourself comfortable!  From here on in, I’m going to show the pieces of the
original program juxtaposed with the corresponding pieces from my
deobfuscated version.  When I mention line numbers, I’ll be referring to
the later unless noted otherwise.  I’ll typically use italicized numbers in
parenthesis to denote these.
</p>

<p>
For my version I have expanded the lone macro (used to compact <code>for</code>
loops), reformated the source, and renamed the variables.  The only
structural changes that I have made are from updating to modern style
function headers and pushing declarations down to be as local in scope as
possible (C99 style).  In one case, I gave a variable different names when
pushing it down into two blocks where it had been reused in different ways.

We’ll start at the end of the program with the <code>main()</code> function and then
work our way backwards to the beginning; we’ll essentially go from top to
bottom in terms of control flow.  Here’s the <code>main()</code> function:

</div>

<p>
The image is basically encoded in two distinct layers.  The lower level
uses a lossless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoding</a> scheme that stores only single bits and
unsigned integers.  We’ll see this in detail later.  For now, it’s enough
to know that the first line (<i>230</i>) checks for an argument to determine
whether to expect the image on standard input or to decompress the image
from an internal string.  The data is stored slightly differently in the
two modes and the related value here doubles as a flag.  The second line
(<i>231</i>) then primes the pump for the decoding this bitstream.  (However,
this turns out to be superfluous as it would have been called later
anyway.)
</p>

<p>
At the higher level, the first thing to be decoded (<i>232–236</i>) is a small
header comprised of four integers.  The first of these stores the image
width as a power of two.  Due to a fixed-size array used to store the
decompressed image, the width is limited to 1024.  The second integer
stores how many lines shorter the image height is compared to the width.
This will be zero for square images but means that only square or landscape
oriented images are possible.  The next two lines decode a pair of
parameters related to the image quality.  Higher numbers here give greater
compression at the expense of image quality.  The lowest legal values for
each are 1 and should produce near lossless results.  For the built-in Lena
image, the four values in this header are 7, 0, 41, and 82, respectively.

<div id="outline-container-org4f12528">
<h2 id="org4f12528">PPM Output</h2>
<div id="text-org4f12528">
<p>
The decoded image is written to standard output in the form of a PPM file.
This is a <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">wonderfully simple format</a> for writing that consist of a small
header indicating the image type, resolution, and maximum color value.  A
single <code>printf()</code> suffices for this (<i>238</i>).  Following this, the image
data itself is simply a series of unsigned bytes in interleaved RGB order
for each pixel and the pixels in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
(<i>245–247</i>).  Because of the lossy format, the decompressed RGB values may
fall outside the 0 to 255 range, so a small helper function is used to
clamp and then write them:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>109: </span><span>K</span>(b){
<span>110: </span>putchar(b&lt;0?0:b&gt;255?255:b);

<span>225: </span>    putchar( byte &lt; 0 ? 0 : byte &gt; 255 ? 255 : byte );
<span>226: </span>}

<div id="outline-container-orgf3b7761">
<h2 id="orgf3b7761">YCgCo Color Space</h2>
<div id="text-orgf3b7761">
<p>
The compressed image data is not actually encoded using the usual RGB color
space, though of course it outputs this at the end.  Instead, it uses the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCgCo">YCgCo</a> color space.  This is easily transformed back to RGB (<i>244–247</i>) but
has some nice properties where image compression is concerned.  Notably,
it decorrelates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance">chroma</a> data.
</p>

<p>
To see this, lets look at the just the Y (luma) color channel of the
built-in image.  We can do this by zeroing out the Cg (green–magenta) and
Co (orange–blue) chroma channels before transforming back to RGB:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/y.png" alt="y.png">

</figure>

<p>
Note how the result is simply the image in greyscale.
</p>

<p>
We can also look at the Cg channel in isolation by setting the Y values in
all pixels to 128 and the Co values in all pixels to zero.  This will show
us how the Cg data looks added to a neutral grey image:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/cg.png" alt="cg.png">

</figure>

<p>
And we can do likewise to view the Co channel in isolation by setting the Y
values to 128 and the Cg values to zero:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/co.png" alt="co.png">

</figure>

<p>
Hopefully it is clear now why this transform is useful: the majority of the
actual image detail is contained in the Y channel with only a little bit in
the Cg and Co channels.  Moreover, the human eye is more sensitive to
luminance than chrominance so by separating these out the encoder can
compress them with different degrees of lossiness.  This is why there are
not one but two image quality factors (<i>235–236</i>).
</p>

<p>
Many lossy image and video codecs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Downsampling">JPEG</a>, offer an option called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>.  When used, the luminance channel is typically stored
at full resolution while the chrominance channels are downscaled and stored
as a lower resolution image by the encoder, then upscaled by the decoder.
The tiny image decoder doesn’t bother with this.  Instead, the encoded
images just crank up the lossiness factor for the chrominance channels
(which JPEG images usually do too).
</p>

<p>
It’s also worth noting (<i>241–243</i>) that the decoder decompresses
the Y, Cg, and Co channels to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar format</a> in memory before writing the
transformed RGB values in the PPM-required <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_pixel">interleaved</a> form.

<p>
The actual extraction of the image to these planes in memory occurs
completely within the function called at line 237.  This is the main
routine for the higher level decoding of the image and is by far the
largest function in the program:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cc5b5dcbba58e6a8ab6be0fc5ba3f4135fc9844/bc970/assets/img/2020/fruta-swiftui/fruta-crash.png"></p><p>Apple released SwiftUI last year, and it’s been an exciting and wild ride. With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

This feels sluggish, not to mention it’s significantly longer than even most websites — that load data via the network — need. Fruta has everything local. What’s so slow here? Let’s look at Instruments!</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46551951d369616ff89d71678a98813dfcd2d94b/97d03/assets/img/2020/fruta-swiftui/instruments.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>Of the 10 seconds captured, 30 percent of them are used for the various retain/release and malloc calls in Swift and Objective-C.</li><li><code>NSAttributedString</code> shows up often in stack traces, which hints that text layout seems especially expensive.</li><li>The AttributeGraph SwiftUI layout engine seems to create a lot of throwaway objects. These might mostly be Swift structs, but they’re still expensive.</li><li>JPG decoding happens on the main thread, but it’s only responsible for less than 1 percent of the time spent here.</li><li>When checking Hide System Libraries, there’s basically no work done in Fruta’s business logic.</li><li>Sorting for Top Functions, we see that AppKit’s auto layout logic, combined with SwiftUI’s graph, is taking up a lot of time.</li><li>There seems to be a lot of unnecessary invalidation. For example, <code>AppKitToolbarCoordinator</code> adds a toolbar item, which triggers <code>NSHostingView.preferencesDidChange()</code>, causing everything to lay itself out once again, even though the toolbar size doesn’t change.</li></ul><p>The good news is there seem to be a lot of potential future optimizations possible to make this fast. Alternatively, there’s always the possibility of <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1304938866999046144?s=21">dropping out of SwiftUI for performance critical parts</a>.</p><p>This isn’t unique to Fruta. I’ve been taking a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian">@Dimillian’s</a> RedditOS app, which is built with SwiftUI on macOS. He <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1301802048824979456">stopped development</a> because it’s so slow that it’s not shippable. I did some debugging with an earlier version of Big Sur where the app still somewhat worked:</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The AppKit port of SwiftUI is... not very efficient. Been testing <a href="https://t.co/67UCuKmPts">https://t.co/67UCuKmPts</a> for a minute, 10% of the time it freezes on the main thread are just spent to... update toolbar buttons? It's a bit hard to measure because it crashes so quickly. <a href="https://t.co/hW4nNe0ydV">pic.twitter.com/hW4nNe0ydV</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1282655123244752897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>The general pattern here points to AppKit: The interaction between SwiftUI views and AppKit views <a href="https://twitter.com/fcbunn/status/1259078251340800000">seems to</a> be <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartcarnie/status/1301895206875181056">poor</a>. It’s important to understand that SwiftUI itself is fast — for many use cases it’s even faster than using <code>CALayer</code>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoawithlove/status/1143859576661393408">as @cocoawithlove proved</a> — and the UIKit port is by far faster and better than the AppKit port.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If your target platform is iOS 14, you’re now good to go with hobby projects or individual screens in SwiftUI. I’m currently working on making our <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/">PDF SDK for iOS</a> easier to use with SwiftUI, and we’ll replace the settings/about screen of <a href="https://pdfviewer.io/">PDF Viewer</a> with a SwiftUI version.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t yet go all-in on SwiftUI for production apps, although the crash rate is likely manageable and Apple is actively improving things with every release. Remember that SwiftUI ships with the OS, not with your app, so any bug fixes will only help if your users update the OS.</p><p>Other ports are not so great. AppKit seems particularly troublesome, but I’ve also heard of big issues with tvOS. If you need to deploy your app to the Mac, use Catalyst, which is a much more stable binding and feels really good with Big Sur’s native mode, where content is no longer scaled.</p><p>If you’re curious about SwiftUI, <strong>please don’t let this dampen your enthusiasm</strong>. It’s extremely fun to write, it’s clearly the future at Apple, and all these issues will surely be resolved within a few years.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>For centuries, thinking and solving advanced problems have been the proper thing for a man and distinguished him from other beings. Already in antiquity, the capabilities of the human mind were defined as originating from an order other than the material world. The modern era, the philosophical foundations of which was laid by René Descartes, turned out to be a triumphant moment for the human mind. He made the body and mind two completely separate and independent substances, and made man the only being on Earth in which the body as an extended thing and the soul as a thinking thing are combined.</p>



<p>The consequences of making the ability to think a mere human trait, often based on theological arguments, are clear to this day. Even in the face of the reflections on other minds that come with new discoveries of the cognitive abilities of other animals, many make an effort to maintain the hegemony of the human mind. Even so, our privileged position is becoming shakier and shakier. While comparing ourselves with other animals, we can still come up with more and more sublime arguments for our greater participation in thinking, the spectacular successes of machines, such as the famous victory of the Deep Blue chess game with the master Garry Kasparov, seem to more and more often embarrass us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machines replace humans not only in physical activities, as animals and less advanced technical tools used to do, but also in what so far was only human power – predicting the effects of actions, making key decisions, recognising phenomena, and reacting to not on the basis of acquired knowledge. Self-learning algorithms write movie scripts, paint pictures, translate languages, make jokes, and diagnose cancer. It’s not uncommon for us at Samurai Technology to use these and many other applications of machine learning to solve challenging problems. But can we say that the actions of the algorithms are based on thinking? </p>



<p>As early as the 1950s, Alan Turing argued that if a machine would be able to use human language enough to deceive us that we were dealing with a human being, we would be able to consider it as thinking. Although the machines of today are tested for intelligence using the Turing test, this criterion has also gathered crowds of critics. One of them is the American philosopher of mind, John Searle, whose counterargument is presented by a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine, says Searle, that you don’t speak or read any Chinese dialect, but end up in a room where you have access to a set of Chinese rules. By using the instructions, you are able to trick a native Chinese speaker into talking to someone who also knows Chinese. If the computer had followed the same instructions, it would have passed the Turing test. However, according to Searle, there is no question of thinking in this case. Even though based on the instructions, it would have been possible to simulate a Chinese speaker, neither about the human nor the computer in the room, we could not say that their actions were based on the understanding of the Chinese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Searle says, a computer is by definition a&nbsp;<em>symbol manipulating device</em>. Any process that can be described formally can, therefore, be simulated by a digital computer. However, according to the philosopher, manipulating symbols does not imply having mental states, which, according to him, are necessary for us to be able to talk about thinking. In the case of computers, we can only talk about their use of syntax, while the human mind is also characterized by semantics (some content). A machine can pass the Turing test, Searle says, but cannot know that it has passed anything. People and other organisms with a nervous system, apart from using rules, understand meanings – they can interpret the context of specific situations and what this context means for them.</p>



<p>According to Searle, minds are the products of biological brains, and the decisive factor in the existence of cognitive processes is the consciousness they produce. The philosopher argues at this point with various views that consciousness is only a computational tool in the brain or that nothing can be said about it due to its subjective nature. Although we do not yet have a complete understanding of how the mind works, Searle argues that we must accept common-sense facts about consciousness and distinguish its characteristics as follows – it is irreducible, all its states are qualitative and subjective, its areas are unified (we are aware of all things at once, not separately), and it also manifests itself causally in our behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The belief that creating a program capable of performing computationally advanced operations is also the creation of some consciousness is an illusion to which, according to Searle, we succumb. Machines merely simulate the processes taking place in the human mind. We may as well simulate a downpour, but no one will think then that this simulation will actually get us wet, says the philosopher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Searle, consciousness is therefore a necessary condition for thinking, and its origin is biological and cannot be mapped even by a suitably complex program. However, it should be remembered that the Chinese room argument is only the beginning of a discussion on the capabilities of computers that have been going on for several decades. Supporters of strong Artificial Intelligence (Strong AI) predict that in the next decade the machine will finally pass the Turing test. Some forecasts also predict that by 2045 there will be machines smarter/more intelligent than people. However, it is certain that we do not yet know everything about the capabilities of our own minds or their digital counterparts.</p>

    <p>Hi, it’s a long time since my last article. This new post is about my research this March, which talks about how I found vulnerabilities on a leading Mobile Device Management product and bypassed several limitations to achieve
        unauthenticated RCE. All the vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor and got fixed in June. After that, we kept monitoring large corporations to track the overall fixing progress and then found that Facebook didn’t keep up
        with the patch for more than 2 weeks, so we dropped a shell on Facebook and reported to their Bug Bounty program!</p>
    <p>This research is also presented at <a href="http://hitcon.org/2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HITCON 2020</a>. You can check the slides <a href="https://hitcon.org/2020/slides/How%20I%20Hacked%20Facebook%20Again!.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    
    <p>
        As a Red Teamer, we are always looking for new paths to infiltrate the corporate network from outside. Just like
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/#infiltrating-corporate-intranet-like-nsa---pre-auth-rce-on-leading-ssl-vpns-15545" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our research in Black Hat USA last year</a>, we
        demonstrated how leading SSL VPNs could be hacked and become your Virtual “Public” Network! SSL VPN is trusted to be secure and considered the only way to your private network. But, what if your trusted appliances are insecure?
    </p>
    <p>Based on this scenario, we would like to explore new attack surfaces on enterprise security, and we get interested in MDM, so this is the article for that!</p>
    <h2 id="What-is-MDM">
        <a href="#What-is-MDM" title="What-is-MDM"><i></i></a>What is MDM?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mobile Device Management, also known as MDM, is an asset assessment system that makes the employees’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BYOD</a> more manageable for
        enterprises. It was proposed in 2012 in response to the increasing number of tablets and mobile devices. MDM can guarantee that the devices are running under the corporate policy and in a trusted environment. Enterprise could manage
        assets, install certificates, deploy applications and even lock/wipe devices remotely to prevent data leakage as well.
    </p>
    <p>UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) is a newer term relevant to MDM which has a broader definition for managed devices. Following we use MDM to represent similar products!</p>
    <h2 id="Our-target">
        <a href="#Our-target" title="Our-target"><i></i></a>Our target
    </h2>
    <p>
        MDM, as a centralized system, can manage and control all employees’ devices. It is undoubtedly an ideal asset assessment system for a growing company. Besides, MDM must be reachable publicly to synchronize devices all over the
        world. A centralized and public-exposing appliance, what could be more appealing to hackers?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we have seen hackers and APT groups abusing MDM these years! Such as phishing victims to make MDM a C&amp;C server of their mobile devices, or even compromising the corporate exposed MDM server to push malicious Trojans
        to all devices. You can read the report <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/malicious-mdm-lets-hide-this-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malicious MDM: Let’s Hide This App</a> by Cisco Talos team and
        <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/mobile-as-attack-vector-using-mdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First seen in the wild - Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector</a> by CheckPoint CPR team for more details!
    </p>
    <p>
        From previous cases, we know that MDM is a solid target for hackers, and we would like to do research on it. There are several MDM solutions, even famous companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Apple have their own MDM solution. Which
        one should we start with?
    </p>
    <p>We have listed known MDM solutions and scanned corresponding patterns all over the Internet. We found that the most prevalent MDMs are VMware AirWatch and MobileIron!</p>
    <p>
        So, why did we choose MobileIron as our target? According to their official website, more than 20,000 enterprises chose MobileIron as their MDM solution, and most of our customers are using that as well. We also know Facebook has
        exposed the MobileIron server <a href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. We have analyzed Fortune Global 500 as well,
        and found more than 15% using and exposing their MobileIron server to the public! Due to above reasons, it became our main target!
    </p>
    <h2 id="Where-to-Start">
        <a href="#Where-to-Start" title="Where-to-Start"><i></i></a>Where to Start
    </h2>
    <p>
        From <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13968/Mobileiron.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">past vulnerabilities</a>, we learned there aren’t too many researchers diving into MobileIron. Perhaps the
        attack vector is still unknown. But we suspect the main reason is that the firmware is too hard to obtain. When researching an appliance, turning a pure BlackBox testing into GrayBox, or WhiteBox testing is vital. We spent lots of
        time searching for all kinds of information on the Internet, and ended up with an RPM package. This RPM file is supposed to be the developer’s testing package. The file is just sitting on a listable WebRoot and indexed by Google
        Search.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2002/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"><img data-original-height="1127" data-original-width="2002" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"></a></p><p>Anyway, we got a file to research. The released date of the file is in early 2018. It seems a little bit old but still better than nothing!</p>
    <p><em>P.S. We have informed MobileIron and the sensitive files has been removed now.</em></p>
    <h2 id="Finding-Vulnerabilities">
        <a href="#Finding-Vulnerabilities" title="Finding-Vulnerabilities"><i></i></a>Finding Vulnerabilities
    </h2>
    <p>After a painful time solving the dependency hell, we set the testing package up finally. The component is based on Java and exposed three ports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>443 - the user enrollment interface</li>
        <li>8443 - the appliance management interface</li>
        <li>9997 - the MobileIron device synchronization protocol (MI Protocol)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All opened ports are TLS-encrypted. Apache is in the front of the web part and proxies all connections to backend, a Tomcat with Spring MVC inside.</p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s2048/2020-09-06_230414.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/2020-09-06_230414.png"></a></p><p>Due to the Spring MVC, it’s hard to find traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS from a single view. Therefore, examining the logic and architecture is our goal this time!</p>
    <p>
        Talking about the vulnerability, the root cause is straightforward. Tomcat exposed a Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. However, this doesn’t mean we can do everything! The main effort of this article is
        to solve that, so please see the exploitation below.
    </p>
    <p>Although we know the Web Service deserializes the user input, we can not trigger it. The endpoint is located on both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User enrollment interface - <code>https://mobileiron/mifs/services/</code></li>
        <li>Management interface - <code>https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We can only touch the deserialization through the management interface because the user interface blocks the Web Service access. It’s a critical hit for us because most enterprises won’t expose their management interface to the
        Internet, and a management-only vulnerability is not useful to us so that we have to try harder. :(
    </p>
    <p>Scrutinizing the architecture, we found Apache blocks our access through Rewrite Rules. It looks good, right?</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://<span>%{SERVER_NAME}</span>:8443/mifs/services/<span>$1</span><span> [R=307,L]</span>
<span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services<span> [F]</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>MobileIron relied on Apache Rewrite Rules to block all the access to Web Service. It’s in the front of a reverse-proxy architecture, and the backend is a Java-based web server.</p>
    <p>Have you recalled something?</p>
    
    <p>
        Yes, the <a href="https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Parser Logic</a>! It’s the reverse proxy attack surface I
        <a href="https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#blackbox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed in 2015</a>, and presented at

        between the Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and reaccess the Web Service. BTW, this excellent technique is also applied to the recently

    </h2>
    <p>OK, now we have access to the deserialization wherever it’s on enrollment interface or management interface. Let’s go back to exploitations!</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moritz Bechler</a> has an awesome research which summarized the Hessian deserialization vulnerability on his whitepaper,
        <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Java Unmarshaller Security</a>. From the
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marshalsec</a> source code, we learn the Hessian deserialization triggers the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashcode()</code> while reconstructing a
        <code>HashMap</code>. It could also trigger the <code>toString()</code> through the <code>XString</code>, and the known exploit gadgets so far are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache XBean</li>
        <li>Caucho Resin</li>
        <li>Spring AOP</li>
        <li>ROME EqualsBean/ToStringBean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our environment, we could only trigger the Spring AOP gadget chain and get a JNDI Injection.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Effect</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Apache XBean</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Caucho Resin</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>√</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Spring AOP</strong></td>
                <td><strong>JNDI Injection</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>ROME EqualsBean</td>
                <td>RCE</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Once we have a JNDI Injection, the rest parts of exploitations are easy! We can just leverage <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a>’s work,

        Black Hat USA 2016 to get the code execution… Is that true?

    <p>
        Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a> introduced this on Black Hat, we could
        say that this technique helps countless security researchers and brings Java deserialization vulnerability into a new era. However, Java finally mitigated the last JNDI/LDAP puzzle in
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u181-relnotes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2018</a>. After that, all java version higher than 8u181, 7u191, and 6u201 can no longer get code execution through
        JNDI remote URL-Class loading. Therefore, if we exploit the Hessian deserialization on the latest MobileIron, we must face this problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Java changed the default value of <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase</code> to <code>False</code> to prevent attackers from downloading remote URL-Class to get code executions. But only this has been prohibited. We can
        still manipulate the JNDI and redirect the Naming Reference to a local Java Class!
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept is a little bit similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return-Oriented Programming</a>, utilizing a local existing Java Class to do further
        exploitations. You can refer to the article <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java</a> by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/artsploit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Stepankin</a> in early 2019 for details. It describes the attack on POST-JNDI exploitations and how to abuse the Tomcat’s <code>BeanFactory</code> to
        populate the <code>ELProcessor</code> gadget to get code execution. Based on this concept, researcher <a href="https://github.com/welk1n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welkin</a> also provides another <code>ParseClass</code> gadget
        on Groovy. As described in <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/Welk1n/p/11066397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his (Chinese) article</a>:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I'm now a user of Vim, not classical Vi (partly because of windows)</h2>

	<p><small>September 13, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In the past I've written entries (such as <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ViAndVimAndMe">this one</a>)
where I said that I was pretty much a Vi user, not really a Vim user,
because I almost entirely stuck to Vi features. In a comment on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/VimNotUsingFeatures">my
entry on not using and exploring Vim features</a>,
rjc reinforced this, saying that I seemed to be using vi instead of
vim (and that there was nothing wrong with this). For a long time I
thought this way myself, but these days this is not true any more.
These days I really want Vim, not classical Vi.</p>

<p>The clear break point where I became a Vim user instead of a Vi
user was when I started internalizing and heavily using Vim's
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html#Q_wi">(multi-)window commands</a>
(<a href="https://vimhelp.org/usr_08.txt.html#usr_08.txt">also</a>). I started
this as far back as 2016 (as signalled by <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/VimMotionCmdsToRemember">this entry</a>), but it took a while before I really had
the window commands sink in and habits regarding them become routine
(like using '<code>vi -o</code>' on most occasions when I'm editing multiple
files). I'm not completely fluid with Vim windows and I certainly
haven't mastered all the commands, but at this point I definitely
don't want to go back to not having them available.</p>

<p>(In my old vi days, editing multiple files was always a pain point
where I would start reaching for another editor. I just really want
to see more than one file on a screen at once in my usual editing
style. Sometimes I want to see more than one spot in a file at the
same time, too, especially when coding.)</p>

<p>I also very much want Vim's unlimited undo and redo, instead of a
limited size undo. There are a bunch of reasons for this, but one
of them is certainly that the Vi command set makes it rather easy
to accidentally do a second edit operation as you're twitching
around before you realize that you actually want to undo the first
one. This is especially the case if your edit operation was an
accident (where you hit the wrong keys by mistake or didn't realize
that you weren't in insert mode), or if you've developed the habit
of reflexively reflowing your current paragraph any time you pause
in writing.</p>

<p>(There are probably other vim features I've become accustomed to
without realizing it or without realizing that they're Vim features,
not basic Vi features. Everywhere I use 'vi', it's really Vim.)</p>

<p>Although I'm now unapologetically using vim, my vimrc continues to
be pretty minimal and is mostly dedicated to turning things off and
setting sensible (ie modern) defaults, instead of old vi defaults.
I'm unlikely to ever try to turn my vim into a superintelligent
editor for reasons beyond the scope of this entry.</p>

<p>(I do use one Vim plugin in some of my vim setups, Aristotle
Pagaltzis' <a href="https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline/">vim-buftabline</a>.
I would probably be more enthused about it if I edited lots of files
at once in my vim sessions, but usually I don't edit more than a
couple at once.)</p>

<p>By Mike Davis</p>



<p>En route to Vegas and 20 minutes away from the state line, there is an exit from I-15 to a two-lane blacktop called Cima Road. It’s the unassuming portal to one of North America’s most magical forests: countless miles of old-growth Joshua trees mantling a field of small Pleistocene volcanoes known as Cima Dome. The monarchs of the forest are 45 feet high and 1,000 years old. In mid-August an estimated 1.3 million of these astonishing giant yuccas perished in the lightning-ignited Dome Fire. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first time that the Eastern Mojave Desert has burned, a megafire in 2005 scorched 1 million acres of desert, but it spared the Dome, the heart of the forest. Desert plants, unlike California oaks and chaparral, are not fire-adapted, so their recovery is an open question. The invasion of an alien bunch grass, known as Red Brome, has created a flammable understory to the Joshuas and transformed the Mojave into a fire ecology. (Invasive cheatgrass has played this role in the Great Basin for decades.) More frequent fires will accelerate vegetation change and ultimately threaten the existence of the trees.</p>



<p>Our burning deserts are regional expressions of a global trend. A world set on fire by climate change has unleashed a dangerous transformation of plant ecology, and thus faunal populations, from the Arctic to Patagonia, Montana to Mongolia. &nbsp;California is a paradigmatic example of such a vicious circle, where extreme heat leads to extreme fires that prevent natural rejuvenation and accelerate the conversion of iconic landscapes into depauperate grasslands and treeless mountain slopes.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this century, water planners and fire authorities were primarily focused on the threat of multi-year droughts caused by intensified La Niña episodes and stubbornly persistent high pressure domes—both of which could be attributed to anthropogenic warming.</p>



<p>Their worst fears were realized in the great drought of the last decade, the biggest in perhaps 500 years, which led to the death of millions of oaks and pines, which then provided fuel for the fire-storms in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<p>These recent catastrophes, however, have forced scientists to recognize a new phenomenon, the &nbsp;“hot drought.” Even in years with average 20th-century rainfall, extreme summer heat—our new normal—is producing massive water loss through evaporation in reservoirs and plant communities. A wet winter and early spring may mesmerize us with extravagant displays of flowering plants, but they also produce bumper crops of grasses and weeds that are then baked in our furnace summers to become fire starter when the devil winds return.</p>



<p>Residential development in high and extreme fire-danger areas, where a majority of new housing in the state has been constructed over the past twenty years, has also promoted the botanical counter-revolution as the thinning of forests and the clearing of chapparal opens new pathways for pyromaniacal black mustards and bromes. Weeds plus dead or drought-stressed trees is the shorthand formula for megafire.</p>



<p>Mediterranean vegetation (California west of the Sierras and south of Klamaths) has co-evolved with fire, and indeed oaks and most chaparral plants require episodic fire to reproduce. But routine extreme fire in Greece, Spain, Australia and California is now over-riding Holocene adaptations and producing irreversible changes in the biota. The only real constraint on future wildfire is available fuel mass. More areas will become like the Malibu Coast where fire burns in the same sector every decade or two as dictated by the 8-12 years required for coastal sage scrub to mature.</p>



<p>In the late 1940s the ruins of Berlin became a laboratory where natural scientists studied plant succession in the wake of three years of incessant fire bombing. The expectation was that the original vegetation of the region—oak woodlands and their shrubs—would soon reestablish itself. To their horror this was not the case. Instead escaped exotics, most of them alien to Germany, established themselves as the new dominants.</p>



<p>The botanists continued their studies until the last bomb sites were cleared in the 1980s. The persistence of this dead-zone vegetation and the failure of the plants of the Pomeranian woodlands to reestablish themselves prompted a debate about “Nature II.” The contention was that the extreme heat of incendiaries and the pulverization of brick structures had created a new soil type that invited colonization by plants such as the “tree of heaven” (<em>Ailanthus</em>) that had evolved on the moraines of Pleistocene ice sheets. An all-out nuclear war, they warned, might reproduce these conditions on a vast scale.</p>



<p>Fire in the Anthropocene has become the physical equivalent of endless nuclear war. In the aftermath of Victoria’s Black Saturday fires in early 2009, Australian scientists calculated that their released energy equaled the explosion of 1,500 Hiroshima-sized bombs. The current firestorms in the Pacific states are many times larger, and we should compare their destructive power to the mega-tonnage of hundreds of hydrogen bombs.</p>



<p>A new, profoundly sinister nature is rapidly emerging from our fire rubble at the expense of landscapes we once considered sacred. Our imaginations can barely encompass the speed or scale of the catastrophe. Gone California, gone.</p>

  <p>A while ago, the camera on my phone started acting up: opening it would show an image for a couple seconds but then go black. Simultaneously, when I turned my wireless headphones on there would be a couple seconds of sidetone (hearing through your own microphone) before it cut to the expected silence.</p>

<p>I promptly got a new phone and the old one was sent to forensics.</p>

<p>A little while after that, my stereo receiver started randomly losing its internet connection, causing streaming from Spotify to break. If I reset it to factory settings – and retrained the room calibration, speaker configuration, etc – it would come back, but within a week it would decide to give up on internet connectivity once again.</p>

<p>All of this was both frustrating and unnerving. We’ve become inured to the poor reliability and security of modern electronics – they are simply too complicated – and one thing I’ve had a hard time reconciling is my feeling that we <em>have</em> to do better with the reality that most things do not experience a strong economic pressure to do so. It is extraordinarily expensive to develop avionics software and other similar safety-critical things, and this is a sign to me both that the fundamental toolchain is broken and that most consumers simply don’t care. Even after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach">OPM hack</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks">DNC cyberattacks</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach">Equifax breach</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack">Sony Pictures hack</a> still no one has developed any good firewalls I would actually trust with my life. They are all too complex, composed of millions of lines of unproven code written by humans.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I see the problem as being the fact that the space of things a system <em>can</em> do being a tiny subset of things the systems is <em>physically capable</em> of doing.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://maxhodak.com/images/system-function-bubble.png">
</p>

<p>There is no meaningful difference between buggy software and insecure software – security vulnerabilities are just bugs used for a malicious intent. In order to build truly secure systems, we must shrink the space of things the machine is capable of doing to things we want it to do and formally prove this.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult to formally verify a program of any meaningful size. One common approach – used by some autopilots, among other things – is to write a model DSL and a small code generator that is feasible to formally verify, and then use that to generate the much larger source code of the actual program, which by extension is verified. This is a good idea and I’d love to see things like this used more widely.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use a language with lots of safety features like strong algebraic typing, immutable memory and no dynamic allocation. These are often functional languages and can go a long way towards making it so that if it compiles, it’s probably correct.</p>

<p>Ultimately you also need awareness of the hardware you are running on: no one was talking about speculative execution attacks five years ago, but now they’re just one example of practical attacks stemming from complex hardware performance optimizations.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://sel4.systems/">SeL4</a> and especially its verified <a href="https://riscv.org/2020/06/sel4-is-verified-on-risc-v/">RISCV implementation</a>. Yes, RISCV made some microarchitecture trade-offs that are somewhat academically pure at a cost to practicality, but for something like a brain implant you definitely want to prioritize making the intended-behavior and possible-behavior bubbles as close to equal as possible.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency world also feels these issues acutely: bugs in smart contracts quickly become large financial losses. Long term, I think the investments they are making into formal verification could be one of their largest contributions back to the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>These problems are all things Neuralink is going to have to invest in over time in order to ensure that the implants are reliable and secure. We will probably need to go way beyond traditional guidelines like MISRA and develop more powerful formal verification tools and code generation for verified hardware, but I think that’s only the tip of the iceberg towards systems that I’d really trust to put in my brain and connect to an increasingly hostile internet. There definitely needs to be much greater investment in these kinds of things, and hopefully an ecosystem develops that explores many possible approaches in parallel.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, I want to make it clear that I’m not accusing the compositor of true evil, which I define roughly as deliberately causing suffering. There’s unfortunately too much of that in the world. I mean it in the more metaphorical sense that it causes serious problems and forces other parts of the system to be more complex to work around its limitations.</p>

<p>I will also outline a better design that might be implemented in the future, as well as some possibilities for how applications can deal with the current situation. But first, to understand better how we got into this mess, we’ll look a bit into the past.</p>

<h2 id="8-bit-systems-video-processing-engines">8-bit systems: video processing engines</h2>

<p>Early home computers and video games had 8-bit CPUs and only a few kilobytes of RAM. Some computers, like the Apple II, allocated some of the RAM as a frame buffer and used the CPU to fill it, but this approach is quite limiting. So designers of most other systems of the time got creative - in particular, they augmented the CPU with a graphics processing engine. This engine did a fair amount of processing during <em>scanout,</em> in other words on the fly as the system generated a video signal.</p>

<p>The details of these early graphics processors varied, but most were a combination of four basic operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indirect lookup of tile images (also useful for text).</li>
  <li>Expansion of low bit depth pixels into more colors through a palette.</li>
  <li>Control over the offset in video memory to read (for scrolling effects).</li>
  <li>Overlay of small graphic elements (sprites).</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of even a modest CPU and one of these video processing engines led to a creative explosion of games, with a unique aesthetic formed from the primitives provided by the video chip: colorful scrolling backgrounds formed from tiles, with the player avatar and other characters overlaid, also moving dynamically. One of the most popular (and best documented) such chips is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">C64 VIC-II</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Processing_Unit">NES PPU</a> is another classic example. People still create software for these beloved systems, learning from tutorials such as <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/22/when-visibility-matters">VIC-II for beginners</a>.</p>

<p>While the constraints of the hardware served as artistic inspiration for a diverse and impressive corpus of games, they also limited the kind of visual expression that was possible. For example, any attempt at 3D was primitive at best (though there were driving games that did impressive attempts, using the scrolling and color palette mechanisms to simulate a moving roadway).</p>

<p>The most ambitious games and demos agressively poked at the hardware, “racing the beam” to dynamically manipulate the registers in the video chip, unlocking more colors and other graphical effects that no doubt were not even anticipated by the original designers of the hardware.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning as an extreme example is the Atari 2600, which had all of 20 bits (that’s right, two and a half bytes) devoted to what might be considered a frame buffer. Basically all graphical effects needed to be implemented by racing the beam. Fortunately, the programmer could make use of the deterministic cycle counts for instructions on the 6502 microprocessor, so that writes to the video registers would happen with timing considerably finer than one scan line. Even so, it requires some <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67b32347d5ca97d21a4c9e69a3b1a1a3">fairly tricky code</a> to even display the <a href="https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.6.0/embed.html?p=vcs&amp;r=TFpHAAAQAAAAAR1Ufls8AQMFDBJ42KIAiqjKmkjQ%2B6kOhQKFAErQ%2Ba2EAgyGCanGhQaFB6kAhQipGIUKDI%2BiJYUCytD7hgGgB4YNhg6GD4UCBADqEg%2BFEIURhQKI0PugEKIMeQ2FDrki8YUPuVXxhRu5ZfGFBLkz8YUNuUTxhQ4MFww%2BytDYuQAMSxEMCwyk6uoFDhyI0LKgOAUERgzH%2B6kChQGpIYUCjZYCBQOXTAvwABIeEgb8rFz4wPwE9BIDBPwAAPCgUPAw8ADwEgMA8AAAwMDAgADAQBIFwAUJNGwAqAULRDcSIRIR%2FxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh4SHBIIAPAA8A%3D%3D">Recurse Center logo</a> in all three colors.</p>

<p>An important aspect of all these systems, even those as underpowered as the Atari 2600, is that latency was <em>very</em> low. A well coded game might process the inputs during the vertical blanking interval, updating scroll and sprite coordinates (just a few register pokes), so they apply to the next frame being scanned out - latency under 16ms. Similar math applies to the latency of typing, which is why the Apple IIe <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">scores so well</a> on latency tests compared to modern computers.</p>

<h2 id="16-and-32-bit-home-computers-cpu--framebuffer">16 and 32 bit home computers: CPU + framebuffer</h2>

<p>Through the late 80s, while arcade games continued to evolve their graphics hardware, the IBM PC became ascendant as a home computer. From its roots as a “business” computer, its CPU performance and RAM grew dramatically, but video output was generally a framebuffer with almost none of the capabilities listed above. Even so, display resolutions and bit depths improved (VGA was 640x480 with 16 colors per pixel). A reasonably powerful CPU, especially in the hands of an expert coder, can produce rather impressive graphics. An example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, which had 3D graphics, fully drawn in software.</p>

<p>Another landmark release was the original Doom, released in 1993, which also was entirely software-rendered graphics, complete with lighting and textures.</p>

<p>The rendering of UI and 2D graphics continued to evolve during this time as well, with proportional spaced fonts becoming the standard, and <a href="http://www.truetype-typography.com/ttalias.htm">antialiased font rendering</a> slowly becoming standard as well during the 90s. (Likely the <a href="https://telcontar.net/Misc/GUI/RISCOS/#text">Acorn Archimedes</a> was the first to ship with antialiased text rendering, around 1992)</p>

<h2 id="multiple-windows-and-process-separation">Multiple windows and process separation</h2>

<p>A trend at the same time was the ability to run multiple applications, each with their own window. While the idea had been around for a while, it burst on to the scene with the Macintosh, and the rest of the world caught up shortly after.</p>

<p>Early implementations did <em>not</em> have “preemptive multitasking,” or what we would call process separation. Applications, even when running in windowed mode, wrote directly into the framebuffer. The platform basically provided a library for applications to keep track of visible regions, so they wouldn’t paint in regions where the window was occluded. Related, when an occluding window went away, the system would notify the application it needed to repaint (WM_PAINT on Windows), and, because computers were slow and this took a while, the “damage region” was visible for a bit (this is explained and animated in Jasper St. Pierre’s <a href="https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/x-basics.html">X Window System Basics</a> article).</p>

<p>In this early version of windowing GUI, latency wasn’t seriously affected. Some things were slower because resolution and bit depth was going up, and of course text needed to be rendered into bitmaps (more computationally expensive with antialiasing), but a well-written application could still be quite responsive.</p>

<p>However, running without process separation was a serious problem, if for no other reason than the fact that a misbehaving application could corrupt the entire system; consumer desktop systems were seriously behind the Unix/X11 ecosystem in this regard. System crashes were extremely common in the days of pre-X Mac OS, and pre-NT Windows (though Windows 95 had a limited form of process separation in that the display server bounded the window’s drawing area). Certainly in the Unix tradition, applications would run in their own process, with some kind of client-server protocol to combine the presentation of the multiple applications together. The X System (aka X11) came to dominate in Unix, but before that there were many other proposals, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">NeWS</a>. Also common to the Unix tradition, these would commonly run across a network.</p>

<h2 id="apples-aqua-compositor">Apple’s Aqua compositor</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0">OS X</a> (now macOS) first shipped in 2001, it was visually striking in a number of ways. Notably for this discussion, the contents of windows were blended with full alpha transparency and soft shadows. At the heart of this was a <em>compositor.</em> Applications did not draw directly to the screen, but to off-screen buffers which were then composited using a special process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor">Quartz Compositor</a>.</p>

<p>In the first version, all the drawing and compositing was done in software. Since machines at the time weren’t particularly powerful, performance was bad. According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2/">retrospective review</a>, “in its initial incarnation, Aqua was unbearably slow and a huge resource hog.”</p>

<p>Even so, things improved. By 10.2 (Jaguar) in August 2002, Quartz Extreme did the compositing in the GPU, finally making performance comparable to pre-compositor designs.</p>

<p>While there have been changes (discussed in some detail below), Quartz Compositor is fundamentally the modern compositor design used today. Microsoft Vista adopted a similar design with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview">DWM</a>, first in Vista, and made non-optional by Windows 8. Also, while I consider Aqua the first real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositor</a> in the modern sense, there were important predecessors, notably the Amiga. Jasper St. Pierre points out that Windows 2000 had a limited compositor, known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-features#layered-windows">“layered windows”</a>, where certain windows could be redirected offscreen.</p>

<h2 id="doing-more-in-the-compositor">Doing more in the compositor</h2>

<p>Using the GPU to just bitblt window contents is using a tiny fraction of its capabilities. In the compositing process, it could be fading in and out alpha transparency, sliding subwindows around, and applying other effects without costing much at all in performance (the GPU is already reading all the pixels from the offscreen buffers and writing to the display surface). The only trick is exposing these capabilities to the application.</p>

<p>On the Apple side, this was driven by iOS and its heavy reliance on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">Core Animation</a>. The idea is that “layers” can be drawn using relatively slow software rendering, then scrolling and many other effects can be done smoothly at 60fps by compositing these layers in the GPU.</p>

<p>Core Animation was also made available in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). The corresponding Windows version was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal">DirectComposition</a>, introduced in Windows 8 and a core feature of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro</a> design language (which was not very popular at the time).</p>

<p>These features have made the compositor more integral to modern GUI software, though there is a range of how aggressively applications make use of compositor feature.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-latency-come-from">Where does the latency come from?</h2>

<p>I talk a lot about latency, but let’s understand why introducing the compositor fundamentally adds so much of it.

<h3 id="-abominable-types">⛄ Abominable Types</h3>
<p><em>“There is a dark corner of the type system that is little known other than to compier writers…”  <br>
– <a href="https://twitter.com/alisdairmered">Alisdair Meredith</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0172r0.html">Abominable Function Types</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/abominable.jpg" width="200px">An <em>abominable</em> function type is the type produced by writing a function type followed by a <em>cv-ref</em> qualifier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>abominable</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>abominable</code> names a <em>function type</em>, <em>not</em> a reference type, and despite appearances, is neither a <code>const</code> nor a <code>volatile</code> qualified type. There is no such thing as a <em>cv-qualified function type</em> in the type system, and the abominable function type is something else entirely.<br>
Note that it is <strong>impossible</strong> to create a function that has an abominable type!
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><em>“The only examples I have of explicitly writing these types fall into the category of showing off knowledge of the corners of compilers, and winning obfuscated coding contests.<br>
I have not yet encountered the following idiom in real-world usage outside of such scenarios.”  – ibid</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>rectangle</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>int_property</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>                     <span>// common signature for several methods</span>

<em>Mwahahahah…</em></p>

<h3 id="-aliens">👽 Aliens</h3>
<p><em><strong>Bishop</strong>: No, the hard-wiring between here and there was damaged. We can’t <strong>align</strong> the dish.<br>
<strong>Ripley</strong>: Well, then somebody has got to go out there, take a portable terminal, and patch in manually.<br>
– Aliens 1986</em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/aliens.jpg" width="200px">Stretching it a bit thin so forgive my “silly” typo, and let’s mention <code>alignas</code> (which when squinting hard enough you might just read as <code>aliens</code>) and its kin. The <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/alignas"><code>alignas</code> keyword specifier</a> was introduced in C++11. It specifies the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object#Alignment">alignment requirement</a> of a type or an object.</p>

<p><em>Every object type has the property called alignment requirement, which is an integer value (of type <code>std::size_t</code> and always a power of 2) representing the number of bytes between successive addresses at which objects of this type can be allocated. The alignment requirement of a type can be queried with <code>alignof</code> or <code>std::alignment_of</code>. The pointer alignment function <code>std::align</code> can be used to obtain a suitably-aligned pointer within some buffer, and <code>std::aligned_storage</code> can be used to obtain suitably-aligned storage. Each object type imposes its alignment requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment (with larger alignment requirement) can be requested using <code>alignas</code>. In order to satisfy alignment requirements of all non-static members of a class, padding may be inserted after some of its members.</em></p>

<h3 id="-demons">👹 Demons</h3>
<p><em>“Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to having <strong>demons</strong> fly out of your nose.”<br>
– John F. Woods, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.std.c/ycpVKxTZkgw/S2hHdTbv4d8J">comp.std.c 1992</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/demon.jpg" width="200px"> The most notorious and infamous of all is probably the Nasal Demon of <strong>Undefined Behavior</strong>.<br>
With its ancient origins in the C language, it predates many of the other members of this list. Nevertheless, it is still an ever present threat and terror to the unsuspecting journeyman.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">short</a>, <em>Undefined Behavior (UB)</em> renders the <em>entire</em> program meaningless if certain rules of the language are violated.</p>

<p>A lot has been written about UB. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr">John Regehr</a> has a facinating <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">series on UB</a> and an <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1520">update on Undefined Behavior in 2017</a> too. His <a href="https://youtu.be/v1COuU2vU_w">two</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/TPyLrJED0zQ">part</a> CppCon 2017 <a href="https://youtu.be/v1COuU2vU_w">“Undefined Behavior in 2017”</a> videos are online too.</p>

<p><strong>STARTLING NEW EPIC:</strong> In Sept. 2017, the Demon showed it still has what it takes when a short UB snippet went <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6xeqr3/compiler_undefined_behavior_calls_nevercalled/">viral</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;                                    // for system()
</span><span>typedef</span> <span>int</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Function</span><span>)();</span>                            <span>// typedef function pointer type  </span>
<span>static</span> <span>Function</span> <span>Do</span><span>;</span>                                   <span>// define function pointer, default initialized to 0 </span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>EraseAll</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>system</span><span>(</span><span>"rm -rf /"</span><span>);</span>  <span>}</span> <span>// naughty function</span>
<span>void</span> <span>NeverCalled</span><span>()</span>    <span>{</span> <span>Do</span> <span>=</span> <span>EraseAll</span><span>;</span>              <span>}</span> <span>// this function is never called!</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>            <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>Do</span><span>();</span>                <span>}</span> <span>// call default-initialized function=UB: chaos ensues.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which Clang  compiles to</p>

<pre><code>main:
        movl    $.L.str, %edi
        jmp     system

.L.str:
        .asciz  "rm -rf /"
</code></pre>
<p>That is, the compiled program executes <code>rm -rf /</code> even though the original program never calls <code>EraseAll()</code>! However, Clang is allowed to do this since the function pointer <code>Do</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> as it is a static variable, and calling <code>0</code> invokes undefined behavior – but it may seem strange that the compiler chooses to generate this code. It does, however, follow naturally from how compilers analyze programs…</p>

<h3 id="-dll-hell">👿 DLL Hell</h3>
<p><em>“There is no greater sorrow then to recall our times of joy in wretchedness.”<br>
― Dante Alighieri, Inferno</em></p>

<div><p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/hell.jpg" width="200px"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL Hell</a> is a term for the complications that arise when working with dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used with Microsoft Windows operating systems.<br>
DLL Hell can manifest itself in many different ways in which applications do not launch or work correctly. Like Dante’s Inferno <a href="http://historylists.org/art/9-circles-of-hell-dantes-inferno.html">Circles of Hell</a>, DLL Hell is the Windows ecosystem-specific form of the general concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">Dependency Hell</a>.</p></div>

<p><em>“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction.”<br>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/duckula.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"><em>Duck typing</em></a> is an application of <em>The Duck Test</em> in type safety.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test"><em>The Duck Test</em></a> is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning"><em>abductive reasoning</em></a>.<br>
This is its usual expression:</p>

<p><em>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.</em></p>

<div><p>“Classic” Duck Typing requires that type checking be deferred to runtime and is mostly relevant to dynamically typed languages (unlike C++). However, templates or generic functions or methods apply the duck test in a <em>static</em> typing context.  </p><p>

In fact, one of the main reasons for C++ Concepts (if/when) they finally land, is to bring a more disciplined approach to template type specification and … well..</p></div>

<p><em>“Unknown objects are <strong>operating</strong> under intelligent control…<br>
It is imperative that we learn where UFOs come from and what their purpose is…” <br>
– Admiral Hillenkoetter, First CIA Director 1960</em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/ufo.jpg" width="200px">C++20 may see the invasion of a new operator into the language:<br>
<strong>The &lt;=&gt; Spaceship Operator!</strong><br>
This is a single, 3-way comparison, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator, that once defined allows the compiler to automatically generate all other comparison operators: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>. It provides a consistent interface and support for partial ordering and other goodies.</p>

<p>Walter E. Brown gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/_PKpyD6Ba1s">lightning talk</a> about it at CppCon 2017 and the latest proposal is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0515r2.pdf">P0515R2</a>.</p>

<p><em>“It’s easy to confuse ‘what is’ with ‘what ought to be,’ especially when ‘what is’ has worked out in your favor.”<br>
– Tyrion Lannister, A.K.A. <strong>“The Imp”</strong></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/TheBottleImp.jpg" width="200px">The C++ standard mentions <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/intro.defs#defns.undefined">undefined behavior</a> Demon’s two less dangerous brothers, <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/intro.defs#defns.unspecified"><em>unspecified behavior</em></a> and the <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/intro.defs#defns.impl.defined"><em>implementation-defined behavior Imp</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation-defined behavior</strong>: unspecified behavior where each implementation documents how the choice is made.<br>
In <em>implementation-defined behavior</em> the implementation is <em>required</em> to document/guarantee what exactly is going to happen, while in case of <em>unspecified behavior</em> the implementation is <em>not</em> required to document or guarantee anything.

<p><em>“Only a lone foe could pierce that cordon; once inside, he would have to move by stealth, and strike with power and suddenness. I chose that mission.”<br>
-– The Shadow, <a href="http://thelivingshadow.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Magazine_Vol_1_131">Shadow Magazine #131 1937</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/shadow.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing">Variable shadowing</a> occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (e.g a block, a function) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner identifier is said to mask the outer identifier. This can lead to confusion, as it may be unclear which variable subsequent uses of the shadowed variable name refer to, which depends on the name resolution rules of the language. In each scope, the same name or identifier may refer to a different variable with a completely different type.<br>
Variable shadowing is by no means limited to C++.</p>

<p><em>“Hasta la vista, baby!” <br>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/terminator.jpg" width="200px">C++ provides surprisingly numerous ways for a program to terminate. These include both normal and unexpected termination.<br>
When writing robust software and libraries, it is important to be be aware of the various ways your code might abruptly end. Similarly, many of these conditions might occur at module-boundaries such as DLLs.<br>
Amongst the standard C++ program terminators we find: multiple flavors of <code>std::exit()</code>, <code>std::abort()</code>, <code>std::terminate()</code>, <code>std::signal()</code> and <code>std::raise()</code>.</p>

<p><em>Remove the uncertainty of landing a tech job</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1965/1*5xfPSnQSMO15rfdGM8g95g.jpeg" alt="Image for post"></figure>



<p id="e8ac">If you’re here, you want to land a technical role, but you’re not sure what to do next. Do you get a specific certification? What tools or software do you need to pick up? You want to know you can land an incredible job that pays well, allows you to learn, and stand among fellow techies. Yet, you’re uncertain right now and unsure if your technical skills are at the level companies want. The last thing you want is for a hiring manager to look at your resume and immediately toss it out. Even worse, he might laugh at how bad your technical skills are.</p>



<p id="8fac">Right now you’re most likely dealing with impostor syndrome, uncertainty, and a bit of intimidation-that’s okay. The path to learning a technical skill is difficult and laborious. But it’ll be worth it. Here’s something else you need to know:</p>



<blockquote><p>Your self-doubt and uncertainty aren’t “part of the journey”, they also convey you know you have more to learn, you’re humble, and you’re open to constructive criticism. Your self-doubt and uncertainty indicate forthcoming success.</p></blockquote>



<p id="1729">Right now, your greatest obstacle is overcoming impostor syndrome. The rest of this article unpacks how to gain more experience, but those tips will sound like fluff if you aren’t able to effectively manage your self-doubt.</p>



<p id="aabf">You’re hard work speaks for itself. You’ve mulled through and completed several programming courses, you’ve become a regular on Stack Overflow, and you’re genuinely interested in building a technical skill set. You are willing to do whatever it takes to land that technical role.</p>



<p id="92b4">Here are two questions to ask yourself if you want to know you’re headed in the right direction:</p>



<ul><li>Have you solved problems outside of your learning context?</li><li>Can you communicate what you’re learning in the simplest of terms?</li></ul>



<p id="8a9f">Results don’t lie. You’re on the right path if you’re producing results outside of a tutorial and you feel comfortable talking through your subject matter.</p>







<p id="bfe6">You’ve put in the hard work and you’re ready to land your first technical job offer. The only foreseeable problem is that you have zero years of technical experience. Here are three practical ways to overcome the “0 years of experience” obstacle, garner interviews, and land your first technical job:</p>



<h2 id="6a19">Create Your Own Role</h2>



<p id="85c8">I want you to think about all the hard work you’ve put in thus far. You’ve internalized syntax by completing courses, you’ve increased critical thinking and business acumen by solving real and interesting problems, and you can speak to a diverse number of stakeholders because you understand your subject matter. The hard work you’ve done up to this point&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;been a job, but no one has paid you for your work. But that’s about to change.</p>



<p id="77d9">I encourage you to try something. Go to your LinkedIn and add a new experience. Use the job title of the role you’re trying to land (i.e. Analyst, Data Analyst, Software Engineer, etc…) and use the company name “Various”. For the description, this is where you show a bit of creativity. As you think about the last year, what have you done? If you completed a project, what did you produce and what were the results? As you complete your description, it’s important you use keywords that represent what you’ve worked on and relevant to the job you want. The reason is that the keywords will increase your profile’s visibility to companies and tell recruiters you’ve done serious work that will translate to the role they’re looking to hire for. If you get stuck or need an example to reference, check out my LinkedIn profile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-chae11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="5abb">Find a Temporary Contract Role</h2>



<p id="811c">Temporary contract roles are one of the most overlooked means of gaining experience. Many companies don’t have enough work or resources to hire a full-time software engineer, analyst, or data scientist so they look to hire a short-term contractor. I encourage you to use this to your advantage. Contract roles are perfect for people who want to gain experience because companies who hire for contract roles have very specific end goals in mind. As a result, you will work on very valuable and high-impact projects with clear deliverables. The best part? You also get paid.</p>



<p id="ed3f">If you’re interested in a contract role, visit LinkedIn, Indeed, or ZipRecruiter and look for roles listed as “temporary”, “six month contract”, “contractor”, or “temp”. You’ll find many contract listings mention the contract can turn into a full-time position. Either way, when the contract ends, you will walk away with valuable experience.</p>



<h2 id="d684">Pay Me, Dustin Moskovitz-Style</h2>



<p id="6e88">When “the” Facebook started out, Dustin Moskovitz was one of the company’s first employees and didn’t get paid. He worked completely for free. During the start of Facebook, he picked up PHP and hustled his way towards adding value to “the” Facebook. Moskovitz defined the meaning of “sweat equity”. Now he’s a multi-millionaire.</p>



<p id="6f6f">In a world that worships the full-time salary, benefits, and perks, we forget about the quintessential startup staple: the unpaid hustle. Would you be willing to work for free if your unpaid work meant invaluable experience?</p>



<p id="71cc">Some of you will hesitate and some of you will jump at the opportunity. I understand that you have to pay the bills and making money feels good. But if you can afford to work for free at a promising startup, at least for a bit, you will walk away with experience more valuable than working at the Facebooks and Googles of the world.</p>



<p id="fe1d">If you want to gain invaluable experience and work with incredible startups, I encourage you to check&nbsp;<a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>&nbsp;site out. The companies on this site want hungry, hard-working people who are going to add value; you won’t mull over Excel spreadsheets all day. In fact, you’ll wear a variety of hats and work different job functions. One hour you could be developing business partnerships with potential clients and the next hour you could be conducting an in-depth analysis of market opportunities. The startup world truly is exciting.</p>



<h2 id="2c3e">Closing Words</h2>



<p id="5366">Impostor syndrome and a lack of experience is difficult to manage. You’ve done a profound job of learning, pushing through adversity, asking relevant questions, and doing whatever it takes to land your first tech job. You heading in the right direction. The road ahead doesn’t get any easier, but you’re closer to a job offer than ever before-it’s only a matter of time until a company sees that and sends you a job offer.</p>



<p id="f341">Your next opportunity awaits you. Go get ’em.</p>

  <p><em>As always, this post reflects my own opinions, and not anyone else’s. I have made every effort to be factual, but corrections are welcome.</em></p>
<p>A preview <a href="https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x/issues/586#issuecomment-552733913">build</a> of the Snes9x emulator is now available for macOS Catalina. This build is missing many features, but is capable of opening games, playing them with keyboard or gamepad, and freezing and defrosting game states. This post will explain how the Mac port of Snes9x got to this point and outline how it might develop in the future.</p>
<p>Snes9x is an emulator with a long history. First released in 1998, (according to Wikipedia) a Mac port was created by John Stiles and released the same year. This port was PowerPC native, and used the Macintosh Toolbox API. In 2000, it was updated to use the Carbon API, allowing it to run on classic MacOS, as well as OS X. From 2001 to 2011, a developer calling themselves “zones”, with contributions from others, continued to update it and add features. Thanks to their work, it made the transition to Intel Macs, where it continued to work until the release of macOS Catalina.</p>
<p>The Carbon API was created by Apple to be a transitional API, allowing applications written using the Macintosh Toolbox API to run on both classic MacOS and OS X. It shared many similarities to the Macintosh Toolbox, making it easy to transition applications to OS X. The intention was to allow developers time to gradually port their code to OS X’s native Cocoa API. Because developers could use Cocoa and Carbon in the same app, Apple hoped that developers would replace parts of their code piecemeal, like a software ship of Theseus.</p>
<p>Despite a massive engineering investment by Apple, this approach often did not work well. Although Carbon was intended to be a transitionary technology, many classic MacOS apps made use of functionality present in Carbon that was not available in Cocoa until years later. Because of this, some developers were choosing Carbon for their new apps even after OS X had already supplanted classic MacOS. Cocoa and Carbon also approached solving certain problems in philosophically incompatible ways, making it difficult or impossible for some apps to adopt the piecemeal strategy. Even apps that wanted to introduce Cocoa gradually had to wait a few years for their userbase to migrate to OS X.</p>
<p>When this approach worked well, it was often for single-platform native Mac software. Cross-platform software often remained on Carbon for much longer. This is partly due to the fact that the Carbon API was more similar to the Win32 API, both in structure and philosophy, than Cocoa was, and that Carbon software was written in the same language, C++, as most major apps on Windows at the time. Cocoa was written in Objective-C, which is still almost exclusively used on Apple platforms.</p>
<p>Snes9x, being cross-platform, was no exception to this rule. Emulators and games often need complete control over the application’s main loop, something which Carbon provides, but which has historically been difficult with Cocoa. It has become easier to write games and emulators in Cocoa over the years, but when zones left in 2011, things were just beginning to improve in that area.</p>
<p>Because the transition was taking so long, many developers felt no urgency to move to Cocoa, even into the early 2010s. Microsoft Office 2011 (released in late 2010) was a Carbon product. Photoshop made the transition to Cocoa in 2010, but much of the Adobe Creative Suite was still Carbon. Even Apple’s own cross-platform app, iTunes, was also using Carbon. Because of widespread belief that Apple invested so much in Carbon for the sake of these three software packages, some believed that Carbon would become a permanent fixture of OS X. It was true that Apple had announced in 2007 that Carbon would not be ported to 64-bit, despite promising to do so in 2006, but it had also been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/06/just-the-facts-maam-64-bit-carbon/">reported</a> that this was  more of a marketing decision than a technical one. After all, most of Carbon had already been ported to 64-bit, and this was present in public releases of OS X. It was assumed Apple had the rest of it ported internally, and it was possible they would reverse their decision for 64-bit Microsoft Office. Even if Apple stayed the course and deprecated Carbon, there was so much Carbon software out there that they would have to give plenty of warning before they removed it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Apple announced that they were deprecating Carbon in 2012, and did not remove it until 2019 with macOS Catalina. This was plenty of time for a Cocoa rewrite of Snes9x, but zones had already stepped away from the project, and during that time, little work was done on the Mac port.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of zones or the other developers who volunteered their time to work on Snes9x. Like many emulators, Snes9x is an open-source project that relies on the work of volunteers, who come and go as they gain and lose interest in the project. There have been other periods in Snes9x’s history that the Mac version went years without substantial updates, and the project was unlucky that no one was interested in a Cocoa rewrite during this period.</p>
<p>I began working on Snes9x earlier this year because I wanted to add a debugger to the Mac port. For the past few years, I have become interested in SNES homebrew development. I grew up with the SNES, and I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of writing a complete game in assembly, the way developers did back then. It’s pure vanity on my part, but I want to prove to myself that I could have succeeded as a programmer on older hardware. In retrospect, it probably would have been more efficient to do homebrew development on Windows, where there are already tools available.</p>
<p>Since Snes9x was still a 32-bit app on macOS, I knew my first task would be to update it to 64-bit. I’d worked on other 32-to-64 bit transitions in the past, but what I didn’t realize when I volunteered to update it was that Snes9x was still using Carbon. Part of me wanted to give up right there, knowing that it would be a large undertaking to rewrite the app using Cocoa, but as far as I knew, no one else was lining up to do the work, and when I thought about it, a Mac without Snes9x didn’t sit right with me. Snes9x has been on the Mac for 21 years, since the early days of the emulator. As strange as it sounds, I’m nostalgic for the emulator, not just for the old games, but for the software itself.</p>
<p>After spending many evening and weekend hours working on the Carbon port over the summer and fall, ignoring my homebrew ambitions in the process, I finally got to the point where the emulator can play games on Catalina. However, the Mac port of Snes9x acquired many features over its 13 years of active development, and there was no way I was going to be able to re-implement them all in a few months in my spare time. As a result, the port contains about as many features as the first Mac release I know of, version 0.95, from 1998. Seeing all those features vanish feels really bad.</p>
<p>While I would like to restore the Mac port of Snes9x to its former glory, it’s a large undertaking, and I’m not sure it’s worth the time. Many of Snes9x’s features are niche or outdated, and I’m not sure anyone even uses them anymore. For example, is the music box useful when there are dedicated SPC players? Similarly, while the netplay feature works, it’s never been great. Something like Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay/">Remote Play</a> feature might work better on modern Macs.</p>
<p>But without more features, I don’t see what role the Mac port of Snes9x has in the modern Mac emulation landscape. Although the Mac has a larger userbase than ever before, a much smaller percentage are interested in emulation, especially for an older system like the SNES, and that audience may be better served by other emulators.</p>
<p><a href="https://openemu.org/">OpenEmu</a> is more polished and easier to use. It’s been better maintained these last 8 years, and it even has an Snes9x core. It’s designed to be easy for people to pick and play games quickly, which is what most emulator users want in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there’s <a href="https://bsnes.byuu.org/">bsnes</a>. Aside from having the most accurate SNES emulation available today, bsnes has most of the features that Snes9x has and OpenEmu doesn’t, like a cheat finder and movie recording/replay. These features are great for enthusiasts, speedrunners, and homebrew developers. And while bsnes does not look or feel native on macOS, it works well enough.</p>
<p>To be fair, Snes9x contains features that bsnes does not, like 8-player support and the ability to toggle graphics layers. However, there’s an argument to be made that I should instead be working on adding a debugger and other homebrew features to bsnes rather than porting Snes9x.</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t shake the feeling that Snes9x should be on the Mac. So many great Mac applications have been lost over the years, and it would be a shame to add Snes9x to that list after such a long run. Although its emulation may not be as accurate as bsnes’s, its hardware requirements are much more modest. It can run well on models such as the MacBook Air and the base 13-inch MacBook Pro, which have difficulty running bsnes. It also uses much less battery power on all MacBooks. The SNES homebrew community is so small that it would be a shame to turn away potential developers because they are using lower-powered Mac hardware. I would also like to use a more pleasant, Mac-like interface, even if it’s not as polished as OpenEmu.</p>
<p>But honestly, I don’t know if I’ll have the time to complete the work. I would like to restore the other input peripherals, (e.g. SNES mouse, Super Scope) cheat functionality, and recording, as well as add a debugger, but that’s not just a lot of coding work, it’s also a lot of design work. Take, for example, the keyboard settings screen. Here’s what the screen looks like in the latest Carbon version of Snes9x.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tesla CEO Musk once again attracted media attention. His brain-computer tech Neuralink technology began to implant chips in a live pig.</p>
<p>Before that, I once proposed my own whimsical idea to my friends: people might be able to live forever. This immortality does not refer to the superhuman creatures in science fiction movies, but to the information technology to copy all human brain information into computers. I am not the only one who thinks like this. The British drama "Black Mirror" and the American drama "Uploading Freshmen" had written this idea into their plots.</p>
<p>Imagine what kind of experience it would be like if your memory and behavior are completely digitized, become part of the computer's code and you, strictly speaking, your copy lives in a virtual world forever. Let's not consider ethics for now, at least this virtual person can indeed do creative work 24 hours a day, which is currently irreplaceable by robots that only repeat tasks.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this kind of virtual technology is that human intelligence can continue accelerating iterative evolution without any reservation. As long as the iteration time is long enough, super civilization may be born.</p>
<p>This virtual person may also die unexpectedly, because any code has bugs.</p>
<p>特斯拉的 CEO 马斯克又一次引起媒体的关注。他的脑机技术开始把芯片植入猪的大脑。</p>
<p>在这之前，我曾经跟身边的人提出自己的奇思妙想：人或许能够永生。这种永生不是指科幻电影里的那种超人类生物，而是借助信息科技，把人的大脑信息写入电脑里。这并不是只有我一个人这样想，英剧《黑镜》和美剧《上载新生》早已经把这个想法写进剧情里。</p>
<p>试想一下，自己的记忆和行为完全数字化，并且你(严格来说是你的副本)成为电脑的代码的一部分而永远活在一个虚拟世界里，那将会是一种什么样的体验。暂且先不考虑伦理道德，至少这个虚拟人确实可以24 小时不间断地去做创造性的工作，这是目前只会重复劳动的机器人所无法替代的。</p>
<p>这种虚拟技术的最大好处是，人的智能可以毫无保留地延续下去，并且加速迭代进化，只要迭代的时间足够长，就可能诞生超级文明。</p>
<p>这个虚拟人也可能会意外死亡，因为任何代码都有 bug。</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Let’s take a detailed look at the implementation behind Gaussian blurs. It’s the image processing algorithm that enables image manipulations like this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.researchgate.net/publication/337080453/figure/fig5/AS:822588544647171@1573131800889/different-levels-of-Gaussian-Blur.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="different levels of Gaussian Blur | Download Scientific Diagram" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.researchgate.net/publication/337080453/figure/fig5/AS:822588544647171@1573131800889/different-levels-of-Gaussian-Blur.jpg?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>We’ll start by reviewing Gaussian distributions and image convolution – the driving forces behind Gaussian blurs. Then, we’ll implement our own Gaussian blur algorithm from scratch with Swift.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you haven’t already read my article about <a href="https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/08/28/how-does-edge-detection-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edge detection in images</a>, I’d recommend you read that first. It’ll help establish a foundation around convolution and the fundamentals of image processing.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Convolution</h2>
<p>In simple terms, convolution is simply the process of taking a small matrix called the kernel and running it over all the pixels in an image. At every pixel, we’ll perform some math operation involving the values in the convolution matrix and the values of a pixel and its surroundings to determine the value for a pixel in the output image. </p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/09348c5368/a55b1477-4f79-4221-8aa1-ab3ae9f01f89.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blurring an Image | Apple Developer Documentation" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/09348c5368/a55b1477-4f79-4221-8aa1-ab3ae9f01f89.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Image Convolution</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>By changing the values in the kernel, we can change the effect on the image – blurring, sharpening, edge detection, noise reduction, etc. </p>
<blockquote><p>Convolution will be clearer once we see an example.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gaussian Distributions</h2>
<p>Next, let’s turn to the Gaussian part of the Gaussian blur. Gaussian blur is simply a method of blurring an image through the use of a Gaussian function. </p>
<blockquote><p>You may have heard the term Gaussian before in reference to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaussian distribution (a.k.a. normal distribution)</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Below, you’ll see a 2D Gaussian distribution. Notice that there is a peak in the center and the curve flattens out as you move towards the edges.&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q73cvNltSuV3L-IDuHO5FsvGLk75aMiO7r0XQq0eQlEdIybmgzxkafvlIUs8kjVzgga2O1kGjKINOOfVAwyJp5xWL_Dns0QKBp2jNVdrCVfiuGOztLyROPG1qOgjApO4U5l-8q8b" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Imagine that this distribution is superimposed over a group of pixels in an image. It should be apparent looking at this graph, that if we took a weighted average of the pixel’s values and the height of the curve at that point, the pixels in the center of the group would contribute most significantly to the resulting value. This is, in essence, how Gaussian blur works.</p>
<blockquote><p>TLDR: A Gaussian blur is applied by convolving the image with a Gaussian function. </p></blockquote>
<p>In English, this means that we’ll take the Gaussian function and we’ll generate an <code>n x m</code> matrix. Using this matrix and the height of the Gaussian distribution at that pixel location, we’ll compute new RGB values for the blurred image.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To start off, we’ll need the Gaussian function in two dimensions:&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k3HBCpKjbajv6jtn47G4AiRSe7EaFJkdAE2tzyhk7Ka8a05Bn0ZUHROsvOQC9iY8GPu8nCit45OOE0bybFW1kzaJp23TDxoKZHnVTinkMs3jkslLIXC1vmk4UalsnoMRnItqQl0v" alt="" width="284" height="78" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The values from this function will create the convolution matrix / kernel that we’ll apply to every pixel in the original image. The kernel is typically quite small – the larger it is the more computation we have to do at every pixel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> specify the delta from the center pixel (0, 0). For example, if the selected radius for the kernel was 3, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> would range from -3 to 3 (inclusive).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><code>σ</code></em> – the standard deviation – influences how significantly the center pixel’s neighboring pixels affect the computations result.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Technically, in a Gaussian function, because it extends infinitely, you could argue that you’d need to consider every pixel in the image to get the “correct” blur effect, but in practice pixels beyond 3<em>σ</em> have very little impact on the resulting values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>We’re almost ready to start the implementation. </p>
<p>We’ll need to create a separate output image. We can’t modify the source image directly because changing the pixel values will mess up the math for the adjacent pixel’s computation in the next iteration. </p>
<p>Finally, we need to consider how we’ll handle the edges. If we were looking at the very first pixel in an image, the kernel would extend beyond the bounds of the image. As a result, implementations will commonly ignore the outer most set of pixels, duplicate the edge, or wrap the image around. </p>
<p>In our case, for ease of implementation, we’ll ignore it pixels on the edges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with implementing the Gaussian function.&nbsp;The first task is to identify reasonable values for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <em><code>σ</code>. </em></p>
<p>While the kernel can technically be an arbitrary size, we should scale <em><code>σ</code> </em>in proportion to the kernel size. If we have a large kernel radius, but a small sigma, then all of the new pixels we’re introducing with our larger radius aren’t really affecting the computation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a large kernel radius, but a small sigma:&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ic0vafHD4byCwnuAvU2ZMUCuxPt9-Q8cey6aAcKw5uIcn7fnUjOktEL5aUSohATCmFDiYA2p6zgtBelUjGY3c2yDpwXuG7T2Z8GurFeyddedPaH7vyvQpDyhPmGVpwd224N1ojcm" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sigma 1, Kernel 111</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As opposed to Sigma 5, Kernel 111:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Awid63HhzetqQMJiYjho3d7BPKEGM_ERn62V-UenNx54YBw7hj4DspY64C97ofY5KS3Vfd3e8tlY0esedLNfS_Bf984CVrRfFrp_LQANChO0fsJhm8pMR253SPkjAc6BOU5AznU2" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Sigma 5, Kernel 111</figcaption></figure></div>
<h2><strong>Code</strong></h2>
<p>To finish our implementation, we’ll also need to normalize the values in our kernel. Otherwise the image will become darker as the values will sum to slightly less than 1. Finally, we’ll need to make sure that the size of the kernel is odd to ensure that there is an actual center pixel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code below is by no means the fastest and favors clarity over brevity: </p>
<p>Here’s the full implementation in Swift:</p>

                    <p>A major issue today is the centralized collection, maintenance, storage, and analysis of log and event data across a multitude of cloud systems and services, or even across disparate cloud providers and on-premise systems. With providers now offering a seemingly endless variety of monitoring solutions, obtaining a “single pane of glass” to consolidate analysis for all of your data can be quite challenging. However, leveraging Netizen's customized and fully managed ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) based SIEM solutions, you can solve these issues with enterprise-grade functionality at a fraction of the cost (and complexity) of other products.</p>

<p>In this white paper, we show you how to accomplish all of this. Also available to enhance ELK's SIEM implementation and maintenance options is Netizen's fully-managed ELK hosting and support packages. Netizen's customized ELK-based products also include cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) features which are especially useful in highly complex environments.</p>

Our objective of evacuating 72 oil workers who were in Libya and desperately heading for the Algerian border was time critical.Â&nbsp; Gadaffi loyalists were in hot pursuit of them, either to kill them or more probably take them and use them as hostages, so how did it all come about?</p><p>It was late February and I was back at the Embassy in Algiers. I had just returned from Cairo where I was part of the UK consular team evacuating British residents. It was a pretty chaotic couple of weeks but we managed to get everybody out who reached Cairo.</p><p>It was the same in Tunisia a couple of weeks earlier. Again, we managed to get those UK citizens who wished to be evacuated out in a more timely and orderly fashion</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Algiers we were closely monitoring the situation that was developing in Libya. On 27 February, the UK mounted a military mission involving Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules and Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers that flew into the Libyan desert and managed to evacuate 150 oil workers.</p><p>However, it was well known that a large number of foreign oil workers were still stranded in the south and west of the country.</p><p>The Ambassador immediately contacted London who agreed that we should try to mount an evacuation operation. This one would be a consular led mission as opposed to a military one and we had to move fast.</p><p>The latest intelligence we had on the oil workers was that they were heading for the Libyan town of Ghadames which lies on the Libyan/Algerian border.</p><p>It was decided that I would lead the mission and would be accompanied by Mustapha, one of our Embassy drivers who would act as interpreter, the British Defence Attache (a Colonel) and an armed Royal Military Policeman (RMP), one of the Ambassadorâ€™s close protection team.</p><p>The reason for the military presence would be their ability, using their special communications equipment, to liaise with UK military back in London for intelligence updates. I then visited the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get their approval for the trip and to ask for accompanying security en-route.</p><p>For this mission, we had decided to drive.</p><p>It was a considerable distance, some 1300 Kms from Algiers to our proposed base of operations in the town of In-Amenas through the Atlas mountains and snaking through the northern Sahara desert. In addition, some of the provinces we would traverse were known to have active AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Maghreb) cells.</p><p>The Algerians agreed to provide security escorts for the whole of our trip and they did a wonderful job of looking after us the whole time.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/100_0228_2/#main"><img width="292" height="219" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1442" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1442"> Libya</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0038/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1451" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1451"> Route marker in the Sahara</figcaption></figure></div><p>Therefore it was with some trepidation we set off. The security situation and the areas we would have to travel through, even with our escorts was still a matter of concern. The time passed slowly as we drove through the Atlas mountains until finally we emerged from the mountains onto the desert plains.</p><p>By now it was late in the evening and dark as we reached the town of Ouargia where we spent the night.</p><p>The next morning at dawn, we set off for In-Amenas. Our aim was to head for the Sonatrach (the largest oil and gas company in Algeria who had agreed to help us) compound in the town, which would be our base for the duration of the operation.</p><p>Having arrived there and getting settled in, the Colonel contacted London who informed him that the oil workers had reached Ghadames, but the Libyan border guards would not let them cross the border until I had provided them with the official paperwork.</p><p>Further troubling news was that although Ghadames was in a Berber area,which had been actively anti-Gadaffi for years, pro-Gadaffi forces and militia were reported to be heading for the town in some force. So now time was definitely of the essence.</p><p>The next morning we left In-Amenas with our escort heading for the Algerian town of Deb-Deb which was just across the border from Ghadames. We arrived there in good time and while the Colonel established our presence with the local dignitaries.</p><div id="gallery-3"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0029/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1452" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1452"> With escort taking a position fix near Deb-Deb</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0032/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1453" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1453"> Luxury overnight accommodation!</figcaption></figure></div><p>I headed for the border post to establish contact with the oil workers. They were a pretty tired looking bunch, not really surprising given what they had been through but I assured them that I was working now with the Libyan and Algerian border officials to get all 16 of them across the border.</p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0026-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0026-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1">Imagine my surprise when they told me that yes, there were 16 EU citizens but they had also brought with them an additional 56 foreign workers from their site, mostly Filipinos, Malays and several other nationalities. The spokesman for the group said they would not come across and leave their non-EU colleagues behind.</p><p>So instead of 16 evacuees we now had 72, a major consular headache. Quick decisions needed to be made. I left the border post and met up again with the Colonel and explained the predicament. We both decided that if we had to get 72 out so be it.</p><p>I contacted the Embassy in Algiers and told them of the situation and that I intended to bring all 72 across the border.</p><p>I also agreed with the Colonel that he and Noel would stay overnight in Db-Deb and keep tabs on the oil workers and brief them as to what was happening while I returned with my driver to In-Anemas to try and arrange coaches, accommodation and air transport.</p><p>For the next few, frantic hours was spent sorting out the logistical details in In-Anemas, arranging accommodation with Sonatrach, renting local coaches to convey everyone from Deb-Deb to In-Anemas and contacting London to get the German parent firm to arrange air transport for the party from In-Anemas back to Frankfurt.</p><p>I also spent most of the night redoing the official paperwork to show 72 evacuees instead of 16. To add to the urgency, I also received a call from the Colonel to say that we had to get the oil workers out within the next 24 hours as pro-Gadaffi forces were at that very moment nearing Ghadames. Time was critical.</p><p>So before dawn next morning we set off with my escort plus two coaches for Deb-Deb.</p><p>We arrived at lunchtime and I immediately got to work with the local Libyan and Algerian border officials to get clearance to bring the oil workers across the border.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, paperwork was signed off and permissions were granted from both sides and the guys finally crossed over into Algerian territory.</p><p>I was not prepared to hang about, so everyone was unceremoniously bundled onto the coaches and picking up the Colonel and the RMP we left Debdeb for In-Anemas.</p><p>After spending the night at the Sonatrach compound, the party headed for In-Anemas airport as I had been called from our Embassy in Algiers on reaching In-Amenas to say that the German parent company had chartered a flight for midday the next day.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0019/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1454" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1454"> Oil Workers at In-Amenas airport prior to their flight out to Frankfurt</figcaption></figure></div><p>After the formalities of customs, we all assembled in the departure lounge for a farewell photograph prior to the party boarding their flight to Frankfurt and then finally they were gone.</p><p>So it was with a sense of relief that we set off on the long 1300 Kms return journey back to Algiers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 40,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 40,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNG</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;This was meant to be a high-level introduction into this topic. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators#Pseudorandom_number_generators_(PRNGs)">here a few other PRNGs to consider. </a> </p>

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-13-bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/cover.png" alt="illustration">
Back in spring 2020 at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
we were looking to replace our <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>-<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
duo by a more lightweight framework to power our future Kotlin microservices.
We did some detailed (at times philosophical) theoretical comparisons that I much enjoyed,
but these cannot substitute a hands-on experience.
We decided to implement proof-of-concept microservices using the most viable frameworks,
stressing them in a benchmark along the way.
While <strong>Kotlin</strong> was the main language,
I saw this as an opportunity to have some fun at home and test (my proficiency with) <strong>Rust</strong>,
which is touted for being fast.
I ended up stress-testing Kotlinâ€™s <a href="https://www.http4k.org/"><strong>Http4k</strong></a>, <a href="https://ktor.io/"><strong>Ktor</strong></a>,
and Rustâ€™s <a href="https://actix.rs/"><strong>Actix</strong> Web</a>, read on to see how they fared.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <a href="#the-results">jump to the results</a> and read the background later, if youâ€™re impatient.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">On TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Why not just refer to excellent <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">TechEmpower Benchmarks (TEB)</a>?</p>

<p>A very valid question to ask. A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submitted TEB implementations tend to be rather optimised.
We wanted to measure such a code style that we would normally write:
one striving to be simple/idiomatic/readable,
but finished promptly and not extensively profiled.
On the other hand, we wanted to include production-grade API error handling
(correct HTTP codes and JSON error messages listing problems of individual parameters etc.).</li>
  <li>Besides high-water req/s performance and associated latencies,
we wanted to capture more operational characteristics like memory usage, CPU usage and efficiency,
along the lifetime of a microservice instance.</li>
  <li>In production, we run our microservices in a rather high-density Kubernetes cluster,
where every instance has to be CPU- and memory-constrained.
We wanted to simulate this environment
and check whether we can use trending â€œserverlessâ€� offerings for new services.</li>
  <li>Our data store, Elasticsearch, differs from ones included in TEB,
and we were curious how synchronous vs. asynchronous flavours of the Elasticsearch client compare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-service">The Service</h2>

<p>For a description of the service to implement &amp; benchmark,
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/api-spec.md">see its API Spec document available in the locations-rs repository</a>.</p>

<p>We benchmark its simplest <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint,
whose work is to look up a <code>city</code> document by id in Elasticsearch,
look up associated <code>region</code> document,
and render response JSON.
It uses internal in-memory cache for regions (there is just tens of them),
but no cache for much more numerous cities.</p>

<p>To reduce bandwidth when fetching documents from Elasticsearch,
all implementations instruct it to strip (at least) the largest property <code>geometry</code>.
This property is only used in Elasticsearch-side filtering, not by the microservice.
I believe the stripping significantly strains Elasticsearch
(or rather transfers the strain from the microservice to it).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark">The Benchmark</h2>

<h3 id="recipe">Recipe</h3>

<p>The benchmark consists of multiple identical â€œrunsâ€� for each Dockerised implementation spawned
by <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/bench-3-impls.py">bench-3-impls.py</a>.
The runs are named after the implementation and their ordinal number,
thus <code>rs-actix-1</code> is the first run of the Rust (Actix) implementation,
and <code>kt-ktor-3</code> is the third run of Kotlin (Ktor) implementation.</p>

<p>Each run simulates the first couple of minutes of the microservice instance using <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/test-image.py">test-image.py</a>.
Steps of one run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Docker container is started, measuring the time until the service starts responding,</li>
  <li>a suite of HTTP checks is made ensuring correct responses and error handling behaviour,</li>
  <li>HTTP load is generated using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>
in a series of 10-second long steps with increasing concurrent connection count;
the metrics are collected from <code>wrk</code> and Docker API after each step:
    <ul>
      <li>first 5 steps use just one concurrent connection, acting as a warm-up,</li>
      <li>each of the next 11 steps doubles concurrent connection count, i.e. continuing with 2, 4,
8, â€¦, 1024, 2048.<sup id="fnref:conn-count" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conn-count">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all runs are plotted using the awesome <a href="http://www.pygal.org/">Pygal</a> library
in <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/render-tests.py">render-tests.py</a>.
Different runs of a single implementation use the same colour,
allowing for visual inspection of the variance between them.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Docker is told to constrain resources available to the microservice containers,
a practice usual in typical Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>The CPU is limited to 1.5 CPU-units using an equivalent of the <code>--cpus=1.5</code> Docker option.
This means that even though the instance has access to all 4 CPU cores of the machine,
it can use only 15 CPU-seconds (out of theoretical 40 CPU-seconds) in each 10-wall-clock-second step.
The value of 1.5 was chosen small enough to ensure the tested microservice is the actual bottle-neck during the benchmark,
and large enough to assert frameworks make proper use of multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>Memory is limited to 512 MiB. I argue that anything beyond 512 MiB should not be called a <em>micro</em>service.</p>

<p>The two JVM-hosted Kotlin implementations run in OpenJDK 11,
with <code>-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75</code> as the sole option.
It should allow JVM to allocate up to 75% of available 512 MiB memory to Java heap.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>The benchmarks run on 2 Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine
located in the same zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st VM, <code>n2d-highcpu-4</code> machine type (4 AMD Epyc <em>Rome</em> vCPUs, 4 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the benchmarked microservice in a Docker container <em>and</em> the <code>wrk</code> load generator.</li>
      <li>As the container is limited to 1.5 CPU and <code>wrk</code> takes less than leftover 2.5 CPUs,
they should not affect each other.</li>
      <li>Indeed, the maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 70%.</li>
      <li>The N2D <a href="https://www.quortex.io/post/an-open-source-framework-to-benchmark-cloud-providers-performances-for-live-streaming">machine type is said to have the best performance/cost ratio on GCP and even across cloud providers</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2nd VM, <code>e2-custom</code> machine type
(12 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/understanding-dynamic-resource-management-in-e2-vms">high-density vCPUs</a>, 6 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs a stock Dockerised Elasticsearch 7.8.0 instance, storage backend for the microservices.</li>
      <li>Maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 80% â€”
I have scaled the number of Elasticsearch CPU cores up until it ceased to be a bottleneck, arriving at 12.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We also initially implemented a Kotlin proof-of-concept in <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>,
but it turned out none of the team members was keen on the programming paradigm this framework suggested
(which may be a subjective matter), so we hadnâ€™t proceeded further with it.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-http4k">The Story of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code></h3>

<p>Http4k Locations service was written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>.
It became the production implementation at GoOut
and is thus most complete along with extras like Swagger serving.</p>

<p>Http4k <a href="https://www.http4k.org/guide/modules/servers/">allows one to select from several server backends</a>,
so we first need to do a qualification benchmark and select the best performing engine to be fair.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-server-engines-pub/bench-results.html"><strong>Kttp4k server engine results on a dedicated page</strong></a>.
Line labels on the graph correspond to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tags">tags in the locations-kt-http4k repository</a>.</p>

<p>One nice side-effect of this benchmarking was that
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141#issuecomment-679330954">discovered a cause</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141"><strong>Netty</strong> backend performance issue</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/pull/480">@<strong>daviddenton</strong> was quick to fix it</a>.
The <code>netty-updfix-*</code> graphs, which exhibit some nice latency characteristics, already contain the fix.
It was later released in http4k v3.259.0 (be sure to upgrade if you use this backend).</p>

<p><strong>Apache HttpCore</strong> version 4.4, labelled as <code>apache4-*</code>, was most CPU-efficient backend
and achieved shared first place in peak req/s performance.
However, it tends to draw too much memory as the number of concurrent connections grows,
and is out-of-memory-killed once their number reaches (extreme) 1024.
Apache HttpCore version 5.0 (<code>apache-*</code>) and a variant with lowered socket backlog (<code>apache-q100-*</code>)
suffer from the same problem.
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/481">opened an issue</a> to see if thatâ€™s a bug or not,
insights welcome.
Meanwhile, I would recommend different http4k backends for services not shielded by load balancers.</p>

<p>The winner of this qualification round is the <strong>Undertow</strong> backend
(<code>undertow-*</code> for v3.163.0 and <code>undertow-upd-*</code> for v3.258.0),
which shares the first place in high-water req/s performance,
but also brings good all-round results in the rest of the metrics,
especially memory consumption under load.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jetty</strong> backend (<code>jetty-*</code>) slightly but consistently lags behind other production engines
in most metrics.
For completeness, I have also included the <strong>SunHttp</strong> backend that is intended for development only,
which the benchmarks confirm.</p>

<p><em>Update: this implementation uses a higher-level contracts API for generating OpenAPI specs, which <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/issues/1">may have some performance impact</a>. I will remeasure to find out.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-ktor">The Story of <code>locations-kt-ktor</code></h3>

<p>Ktor variant was also written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
I later tweaked the <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint for functional parity with other implementations.
It remains the least complete implementation with just this single endpoint.</p>

<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client">es-kotlin-wrapper-client</a> to wrap
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-getting-started-asynchronous-usage.html">intrinsic async API of the Elasticsearch client</a>
into Kotlin coroutines.</p>

<p>Ktor also allows for pluggable HTTP server engines which I benchmarked.
See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-ktor-server-engines/bench-results.html"><strong>Ktor server engine benchmarks page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is similar here with <strong>Netty</strong> being more efficient and performant than <strong>Jetty</strong>,
thus qualified as Ktorâ€™s engine of choice for the main benchmark.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-rs">The story of <code>locations-rs</code></h3>

<p>I wrote the Rust clone in my free time, closely following the development of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code>.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iqq8k9/announcing_actixweb_v30/">Actix Web 3.0 was <em>just</em> released</a>
and I was eager to compare how it fares against v2.0 performance-wise.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-actix-versions/bench-results.html"><strong>The one-to-one benchmark shows v3.0 is at least on par with v2.0</strong></a>.
I think thatâ€™s good news given that v3.0 has advanced on the safety front.
Note that I had to <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/commits/rs-actix3-skylake">remove Swagger support</a>
as <a href="https://github.com/wafflespeanut/paperclip">paperclip</a> is not yet ported to Actix 3.0,
but that should have no runtime effect.

	<div>
		
<div><p>Dear Mohsin,</p><p>Mr. Cook made us read a lot of books my junior year of high school, but the book that stood out the most to me was yours, <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em>. I had read books that I had seen bits of myself in before: <em>The Power of One</em>, <em>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian</em>, <em>Othello,</em> but&nbsp;I had never read a piece of fiction that spoke to me as much as your book did. There was the obvious: a young brown man with an uncommon name (Changez), who attended a renowned American educational institution, played soccer, had an interest in business, was caught between two worlds, struggled with the decision to grow a beard, who even traveled for work as I aspired to.&nbsp;</p><p>But what I remember most clearly was the day our class discussed Changez’s reaction to the twin towers falling, how his &nbsp;reaction as an ivy-league educated Pakistani working at a prestigious New York consulting firm was not one of knee-jerk sympathy, but something a bit harder to admit. Our class was mostly composed of girls, all pretty and athletic and popular, and two or three boys who were also handsome, athletic, and popular (an argument could maybe be made for my being handsome— I most certainly was not athletic or particularly popular, however). A cocktail of a teenage lack of confidence combined with a cluelessness of how to talk to girls in a way that did not jeopardize my own social standing and did not alienate my upbringing prevented me from saying much in this class. On this day I was especially silent, hearing my American classmates echo each other’s bewilderment as to how one could possibly see such a great tragedy unfold and not immediately be moved to compassion, disbelief, and wrath. Mr. Cook asked us how we felt when we saw images of Baghdad being blown to smithereens on TV, in grainy green night-vision footage. Nobody volunteered that we felt the way Changez did when he saw the towers fall, but we all knew that Iraq’s tragedies were not as moving as New York’s. </p></div>



<p>You see, my own 9/11 experience was altogether a very different one. I was seven years old, at the tail end of a summer spent in India. I remember inventing a game with my cousins called “Par-the-Level”, where we combined the classic “Floor-is-Lava” game with the basketball favorite “HORSE” and added many inventive obstacles to the mix. It was a summer full of chasing the ice cream cart man as he walked down the dusty streets in the afternoon, calling out loudly “Kwality Wall’s, Kwality,” knowing full well that the announcement of the local ice cream brand would send children our age darting to the nearest adult for a handful of rupees to exchange for some of his frozen treats. It was the summer I first learned cricket, when I started speaking Urdu, when my newfound independence of being able to roam the neighborhood with my gang of cousins liberated me from the sheltered routines of suburban, homeschooled New England life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was the summer that changed everything. I remember coming downstairs for a glass of water after an intense session of Par-the-Level when my aunt called me over and asked “Obaid, what happened to your America?” It didn’t feel weird to me that she would address me this way, because yes, it was my America. India was nice but I hated the layer of <em>malai</em>&nbsp;that always formed on the milk here, and Chocos were great but that was about the only cereal that was— unlike in my own country where we had Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Froot Loops and all manner of juvenile diabetes packaged as breakfast staples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What do you mean what happened?” I asked. “It’s been attacked,” she said. I almost laughed in her face, so ridiculous the idea seemed to seven-year-old me. America, attacked? I didn’t know much, but I knew for a fact that it was the strongest nation in the world, that wars and such horrors were a reality for others, not for us. But she directed my attention to the TV screen, and for the next several days all I saw were two scenes that will forever be embedded in my mind: one an aerial shot of a plane hitting a tower, and the second a shot from street level, that showed a man walking towards the camera, hearing the impact, looking up, and running full speed away from the explosion in the most primal of human responses. I had no choice but to accept this reality.</p>



<p>I felt bad. It was terrible that such a thing had happened, and only an hour and a half drive from our home, where my dad was. We talked to him on the phone and he reassured us that he was okay. We were supposed to fly back later that week into JFK, but when the airport was shut down our stay in India was prolonged for another week or two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven-year-old me had a conviction and simplicity that I envy sometimes. He saw the adults who never used to watch TV now always huddled around it watching boring news channels, that showed no other news for the next several days. He saw them worry about how their youngest sister, my mother, would make it back with three small children in tow, the youngest of whom was just three months old. They worried about the change of itineraries and airport closures, the fact that our flight would now stop at Heathrow just so they could deplane everyone to go through a final security check before we would be allowed to continue across the pond.</p>



<p>I had two main complaints. First, we were not terrorists, we did not know any terrorists, and we did not support terrorists. So why worry? We were just normal Americans, what did we have to be afraid of? Everyone would know we were innocent. And second, for God’s sake would you grown ups stop watching the news? We had missed days of cartoons, let us go back to watching <em>Thundercats</em> and <em>Tom and Jerry</em> and <em>The Mask</em> please!</p>



<p>In the months and years that followed, however, I saw a shift in my country. People who looked or prayed like me (or in many cases didn’t— bigotry is lazy when it comes to fact-checking) were “randomly selected” to step aside in airport security lines. Countries half a world away were bombed and invaded, and hundreds of thousands of innocent people were hurt, killed, and uprooted. But they were just numbers,&nbsp;and as horrid as the idea was, Stalin was right on one thing: a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic.</p>



<p>There was a sort of hypocrisy that surfaced in America, one where leaders would talk about how we’d need to give up some freedoms so that we might defeat those who would take away our freedoms. Benjamin Franklin would have been disappointed, would have thought we deserved neither. There was great talk of spreading democracy and liberty to far corners of the world, and yet at home groups of people were singled out, profiled, spied on, arrested, deported, and denied due process, in the name of those very values.</p>



<p>My dad and I used to watch <em>World News Tonight With Peter Jennings</em> religiously, and I felt a great connectedness to the world watching the news with him. We would often sit together on our prayer rugs&nbsp;after <em>Isha namaz</em> talking about current events, and he’d give me history lessons to contextualize what was happening until my mom would invariably come and tell us both to go to bed. When the bombings started he brought home a black and white print out of a map of Afghanistan from work, and later Pakistan and Iraq as well, to tape to my bedroom wall so that we could look up the places Peter Jennings would speak of. And yet, in the summer after 5th grade when I was getting ready to go to school, my parents and my grandmother sat me down after dinner one evening and told me not to talk about politics at school. If I heard something I didn’t agree with, better to keep my head down and not engage than to say something and end up on the news. Maybe it was overly cautious of them in retrospect, and I certainly don’t remember my classmates ever bringing up the news in the cafeteria, they were much more concerned with Green Day and Runescape. But I had this idea in my head that I needed to be careful, that the Bill of Rights applied to everyone equally but it applied more equally to some people than others. We’d hear from time to time about friends of family friends who would get FBI visits, who would find out their phones were tapped, who would get pulled over for one thing and get questioned for another.</p>



<p>It made for a confusing time to come of age, one in which the question of identity was incredibly politicized and murky. It was never enough to say that I was American because the follow-up question would inevitably be “But where are you really from?” So I learned to preemptively elaborate my Americanness by saying I was born in India, or that I was Muslim, before anyone could ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the first time in my life I ever truly felt American after 9/11 was during an exchange program to China in high school. There, the fact that I was from an American school was reason enough to lump me in with the rest, for me to be an unhyphenated American. And yet, even there the shadow of the collective experience followed me— I remember on the way back being anxious at the airport, as I often was, that someone would find fault with my passport or my name or my age or my beard or the travel prayer rug I had in the front pocket of my backpack, and would single me out for secondary questioning, perhaps even cause me to miss my flight while they let my white classmates go.</p>



<p>It was refreshing, then, in that same year of high school as the China trip to take Mr. Cook’s class on American Literature, and to read your book. After a lifetime&nbsp;of never seeing characters in novels or TV shows who reminded me of myself, of never seeing my skin represented outside of Bollywood movies (perhaps with the notable exception of <em>Harold and Kumar</em>), Changez felt like a welcome introduction. I understood his background and his references, and I felt that his struggles with identity and belonging were genuine, real. We dissected his experiences as a class, the same way we did <em>Walden</em> or <em>Ben…</em></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>EDIT</em>: Note that I’ve include the full tutorial in the project <a href="https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter/tree/master/tutorial/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write-a-C-interpreter</a>. Please check that instead.</p>
<p>In “Let’s Build a C Compiler” series, we will build a compiler from scratch
for C programming language. I hope you will get some understanding of compiler
construction by the end of this tutorial. At the same time we will build a
usable compiler of C though some syntaxes are not supported.</p>
<p>Note that it is actually an Interpreter and can interpret itself. I use the
word “compiler” because it is more attractive, but we did more than that. Also
this series is actually written in Chinese in the first place, If you are
confused by my English, please leave some comments.</p>
<p>In this very first chapter there will not be any code. If you are those that
likes code instead of texts, please skip. I’ll talk about the intention of
this series.</p>
<h2 id="why-compiler-theory"><a href="#why-compiler-theory"></a>Why Compiler Theory</h2>
<p>What is the most important courses in computer science? I would give “Data
Structure”, “Algorithm” and “Compiler Theory”. In my point of view,
understanding <strong>recursion</strong> is the first level for programmers, and <strong>writing
a compiler</strong> is the next one.</p>
<p>(Of course, there exists a lot of excellent programmers that don’t write a
compiler, but at least writing one is a big challenge)</p>
<p>People used to say that you can write more efficient code if you know how the
compiler works. But who cares when the modern computers have performance so
high that we can hardly imagine before? Then why bother with compiler theory?</p>
<p>Because it is cool!</p>
<p>OK, admit it, you are still reading mainly because you are curious how far
would I go with this tutorial. But be careful, it will go quite far.</p>
<p>No? You just want to know how to build a compiler? OK then… my mistake.</p>
<h2 id="hard-to-understand-hard-to-implement"><a href="#hard-to-understand-hard-to-implement"></a>Hard to understand, hard to implement?</h2>
<p>I have always been in awe of compiler. So when I went to college and they taught
compiler theory, I was so enthusiastic! And then… then I quit, because I
could not understand a single part.</p>
<p>Normally a course about compiler will cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to represent syntax (such as BNF, etc.)</li>
<li>Lexer, with somewhat NFA(nondeterministic finite automata),
DFA(deterministic finite automata).</li>
<li>Parser, such as recursive descent, LL(k), LALR, etc.</li>
<li>Intermediate Languages.</li>
<li>Code generation.</li>
<li>Code optimization.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that most(98%) students will not care anything beyond parser(at
least in my school). And the most important thing is: we still don’t know how
to build a compiler! Even after all these theories. The main reason is that
what “Compiler Theory” try to teach is actually “how to build a parser
generator”, namely a tool that consumes syntax grammar and generates compiler
(such as lex/yacc).</p>
<p>These theories try to taught us how to solve problems in a common way
automatically. That means once you master them, you are able to deal with all
kinds of grammars. They are indeed useful in industry. Nevertheless they are
too powerful and too complicate for students and most programmers. You will be
convinced if you read the source code of lex/yacc (or flex/bison).</p>
<p>The good news is, building a compiler is far simpler than you’d ever imagined.
I won’t lie, it is not easy, but not that hard.</p>
<h2 id="original-intention-is-for-self-practicing"><a href="#original-intention-is-for-self-practicing"></a>Original intention is for self-practicing</h2>
<p>I saw <a href="https://github.com/rswier/c4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">c4</a> on Github. It is a small C
interpreter which is claimed to be implemented by only 4 functions. The most
amazing part is that it is bootstrapping (that interpret itself). Also it is
done with about 500 lines!</p>
<p>Existing tutorials is either very simple(such as implementing a simple
calculator) or using automation tools(such as flex/bison). c4 is implemented
all on its own. The bad thing is that it try to be minimal, so the code is
quite a mess, hard to understand. So I started a new project that:</p>
<ol>
<li>implement a working C compiler(interpreter actually)</li>
<li>Writing this tutorial to show how to do it.</li>
</ol>
<p>c4 is about 500 Lines, it took 1 week for me to re-write it, resulting 1400
lines including comments. The project is hosted on Github: <a href="https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Write a C Interpreter</a></p>
<p>Note: Almost all logic of this project is taken from c4. So the original
author(rswier) takes credit.</p>
<h2 id="caution"><a href="#caution"></a>Caution</h2>
<p>Two major problem I met when I working with this project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>boring, there will be codes that are almost identical.</li>
<li>hard to debug. We don’t have good test cases. On the other hand if the
output is wrong, I could only follow the generated code all by myself to
debug.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I hope you’ll take out enough time and patience for studying, cause I am
sure that you will feel a great sense of accomplishment just like I do.</p>
<h2 id="references"><a href="#references"></a>References</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Build a Compiler</a>: a very good
tutorial of building a compiler for fresh starters.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemon Parser Generator</a>: the parser
generator that is used in SQLite. Good to read if you won’t to understand
compiler theory in code.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, I am human with a general level, there will be inevitably wrong
with the articles and codes(also my English). Feel free to correct me!</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Understanding the Problem</h2><p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1398/problem/B">Substring Removal Game</a> is an 800-point problem at codeforces, I&nbsp;hope you have read the problem carefully and have tried thinking about solving it. This problem basically states as its name sounds to say, to remove a substring.</p><p>Per each test, you're given a string of binary characters (0's and 1's)&nbsp;and you're required to remove each consecutive 1's to make Alice win. Who is Alice? Alice and Bob are players in the game, and the winner is the one who removes the highest numbers of 1's. Your duty is to make Alice win given that Alice is the first to move.</p><h2>How to Think for a Solution</h2><p>This problem has two inputs:</p><ul role="list"><li>input for test cases</li><li>input for each string of binary characters per each test case</li></ul><p>You can think of this problem as capturing all consecutive ones in the string first and then we can make a decision on which 1's we should focus on to make Alice win. For example, if the input is 01111001 this means that we have 4 consecutive 1's and then just 1; to make Alice win in this case, we should make her take that move which is obviously her first move already and then Bob can take the second move which is the last 1 in the string.</p><p>Let's have another example, 111111 these are 6 ones which can be the first move for Alice so 6 moves will be her win.</p><p>How about this tricky one:&nbsp;101010101?</p><p>So there are 5 ones .. which of them should be Alice's moves? That would be the first and the third and the fifth .. so here 3 moves for Alice.</p><p>What for this one:&nbsp;011011110111?</p><p>Here, we have 2 consecutive ones, 4 consecutive ones, and 3 consecutive ones. Which moves can make Alice win? so we need then to think how we can make number of moves the highest possible so if we sort numbers of consecutive ones in descending order and then start on the highest number that would give us the first move for Alice, and the second move should be a step two from that one. So in this case:&nbsp;[4 3 2] Alice will take moves 4 and 2 which sum up to 6.</p><p>‍</p><p>That's how I&nbsp;thought about this problem and below is my implementations in Python and Javascript:</p><h2>Python</h2><p>‍</p><h2>Javascript</h2><p>‍</p><h2>Shoutout</h2><p>I'd like to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE8qf5sfn4Y&amp;ab_channel=codeExplainer">this video</a> because the idea of solving this solution is from this guy. Check out his solution in C++&nbsp;if you're interested.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>The time has come, for Apple has released  new<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#introduction"> App Store Guidelines</a>.</p>



<p>Previously Apple updated their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">User Privacy and Data</a> page, stating more information on the topic would be upcoming later this fall.  On September 11th 2020, they posted an update to the App Guidelines.  While this doesn’t answer all the questions it’s clear they are serious about this and the standard are very closely aligned to Europe’s <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the strongest data protection law in the USA is the<a href="https://cunderwood.dev/2020/08/19/california-attorney-general-has-released-final-regulations-for-the-ccpa/"> California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA).  The CCPA uses an ‘Opt-Out of Sale” model.  These guidelines however are “Opt In to collection” which is <strong>far </strong>more restrictive.  Also, while the CCPA applies only to residents of California, the Guidelines apply to anyone who submits an app, regardless of their location or the location of their users.  These guidelines, if enforced, will go on to become one of the strictest data protection standards in the USA to see wide spread adoption.</p>



<p>Developers are also required to upgrade their appd to be compliant with the current version of iOS/iPadOS/MacOS, or allow Apple to delist non-compatible versions. As a result these changes will be required to keep distributing on the App Store, as per the developer agreement.  So brands can not selectively ‘not upgrade’ in order to bypass these requirements.  Compliance is thus mandatory.</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: I am not an Apple employee, nor a lawyer.  I am not giving legal advice, but I am raising things to consider when designing and releasing your mobile app on the App Store.   Should you have concerns, I <strong>strongly </strong>encourage a discussion with legal counsel.</p>



<p>Here’s what I believe the relevant sections to be concerned about from a data and analytics perspective are .  The list below is not complete.  The entire guideline policy printed out is roughly 24 pages,   Again, I <strong>strongly </strong>advise reviewing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#introduction">full policy</a> to see which parts may be relevant to your specific scenarios.</p>



<p>With that out of the way – let’s cover some of the more interesting bits…</p>



<blockquote><p><span> </span><strong>(vi)</strong><span> Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. <strong>Apps should not require users to</strong> rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, </span><strong><span>enable tracking, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation</span></strong><span>, including but not limited to gift cards and codes.</span></p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#unacceptable</cite></blockquote>



<p>Taken broadly, I take this to mean that apps must not close off or otherwise restrict access to the something they have paid for simply because a user disallows tracking.  </p>



<blockquote><p>(i) Privacy Policies: All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in the App Store Connect metadata field and within the app in an easily accessible manner. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly:</p><ul><li>Identify what data, if any, the app/service collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data.</li><li>Confirm that any third party with whom an app shares user data (in compliance with these Guidelines) — such as analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as any parent, subsidiary or other related entities that will have access to user data — will provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in the app’s privacy policy and required by these Guidelines.</li><li>Explain its data retention/deletion policies and describe how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of the user’s data.</li></ul><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage</cite></blockquote>



<p>Privacy Policies should be standard for most businesses today, as they are required by both the California Consumer Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as a requirement for having Google Analytics installed on your website.  They are also, as shown above, a requirement of the App Store.  </p>



<p>Of note is the ‘explain the retention and deletion polices’ which require statement of how a user can revoke consent or request deletion of their data.   This is already standard practice under GDPR and CCPA, and now is a cost of doing business on the app store even if you are not subject to those laws.   Your organization is thus required to have a method of opt-ing out of collect once opt’d in, <strong>and </strong>a mechanic which deletes data previously collected.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>(ii) Permission </strong>Apps that collect user or usage data <strong>must secure user consent</strong> for the collection, <strong>even if such data is considered to be anonymous at the time of or immediately following collection</strong>. Paid functionality must not be dependent on or require a user to grant access to this data. <strong>Apps must also provide the customer with an easily accessible and understandable way to withdraw consent</strong>. Ensure your purpose strings clearly and completely describe your use of the data. Apps that collect data for a legitimate interest without consent by relying on the terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or similar statute must comply with all terms of that law. Learn more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/protecting_the_user_s_privacy">Requesting Permission</a>.</p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is the large charge mentioned previously about requiring permission to track user data.  As written, I take this to be clear.  You must secure user consent prior or at the time of collection, <strong>regardless of if the data is anonymous</strong>, and you must provide ways to withdraw that consent once it has been granted.  The way this is written leads me to believe this applies to Analytics as well, but I have yet to receive clarification on that.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>(v) Account Sign-In: </strong>If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a log-in. <strong>Apps may not require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality of the app or required by law</strong>. If your core app functionality is not related to a specific social network (e.g. Facebook, WeChat, Weibo, Twitter, etc.), you must provide access without a login or via another mechanism. <strong>Pulling basic profile information, sharing to the social network, or inviting friends to use the app are not considered core app functionality</strong>. The app must also include a mechanism to revoke social network credentials and disable data access between the app and social network from within the app. <strong>An app may not store credentials or tokens to social networks off of the device</strong> <strong>and may only use such credentials or tokens to directly connect to the social network from the app itself while the app is in use</strong>.</p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-collection-and-storage</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the major concerns I saw voiced in the industry was that the <a href="https://cunderwood.dev/2020/06/27/wwdc-roundup/">WWDC changes</a> announced in June would simply force the creation of ‘Account Walls’ to access mobile apps.  It seems Apple has thought of this and decided to head it off.  </p>



<p>This clause states you can’t require login in most scenarios for app access.  You can require personal information only when it is directly relevant for the app (like when completing a sale).  So most apps will under these requirements likely have to support a ‘guest’ mode where the user can use the core app features without creating an account (Social networks are an exception to this).</p>



<blockquote><p>(i) <strong>Unless otherwise permitted by law, you may not use, transmit, or share someone’s personal data without first obtaining their permission</strong>. You must provide access to information about how and where the data will be used. <strong>Data collected from apps may only be shared with third parties to improve the app or serve advertising </strong>(in compliance with the Apple Developer Program License Agreement). <strong>Apps that share user data without user consent or otherwise complying with data privacy laws may be removed from sale and may result in your removal from the Apple Developer Program</strong>.</p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-use-and-sharing</cite></blockquote>



<p>While Apple is not clear about the definition of ‘personal data’ (not defined in the Guidelines or in the Developer Agreement) the statement is clear that permission is required to use, transmit off the device, or share data.    The data <strong>can </strong>be shared with 3rd parties with consent, but it’s limited in how this is done as per the terms of the developer agreement.</p>



<p>It goes on to state that if you do not comply, they will delist your mobile app at minimum.  You are required to not only comply with these guidelines but all privacy and data collection laws and regulations  for the jurisdiction in regard to collection, use or disclosure as determined by the developer agreement.  </p>



<p>Failure to do so <strong>may also result in termination of your developer account</strong>, preventing the ability to submit apps to the App Store.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>(ii) </strong>Data collected for one purpose may not be repurposed without further consent unless otherwise explicitly permitted by law.</p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-use-and-sharing</cite></blockquote>



<p>This means you must require consent for each use case.  You can’t assume previously granted consent applies to the new scenario unless the legal regulations support that.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>(iii) Apps should not attempt to surreptitiously build a user profile based on collected data and may not attempt, facilitate, or encourage others to identify anonymous users</strong> or reconstruct user profiles based on data collected from Apple-provided APIs or any data that you say has been collected in an “anonymized,” “aggregated,” or otherwise non-identifiable way.</p><cite>https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#data-use-and-sharing</cite></blockquote>



<p>Simply – you can not attempt to reverse engineer aggregate or anonymized data.   </p>



<blockquote><p><strong>(vi) Data gathered from the HomeKit API, HealthKit, Clinical Health …</strong></p></blockquote></div></div>

<h3>Habit and Patterns versus Discipline.</h3>



<h4>Stoics Had An Idea: Discipline</h4>



<p>Marcus Aurelius and the movement of Stoicism emphasized Discipline.  However, discipline is like stamina.  It runs out when applied constantly.  </p>



<h4>Patterns live longer than Forces</h4>



<p>The solution is Habit. </p>



<p>Patterns Live Longer than Forces.  </p>



<p>A man who had gone through the front windshield of a car and cracked his skull on the open pavement once told me, years after the fact, “Nothing by force.”</p>



<h4>Nothing By Force</h4>



<p>Typically, people try to learn by doing something all at once for many hours and hoping they made a deep enough imprint for it to last a lifetime.</p>



<h4>The Analogy of the Stone and Drops of Water</h4>



<p>The Analogy of the Stone and Drops of Water were conveyed by a Tibetan Lama: </p>



<blockquote><p>Consider you have a large rock where you want to bore a hole through to the other side.  </p><p>If water were to drip one drop at a time onto this stone, after a long and determined while the hole would be bored through the rock.</p><p>If, on the other hand, we decide to become clever, and calculate exactly how many drops it takes to bore a hole, we can fill a gigantic vessel with the right amount of water and pour it all on the rock at once.</p><p>The effect is what ?  The rock is shiny, it looks resplendent in the sun, there’s a cool sensation for a little while, but the glimmery rock dries off and there’s no hole bored through.</p><p>Only with the determination of a chain of droplets does a hole get bored through the rock.</p><cite>The analogy of the rock, as conveyed by a Tibetan Lama</cite></blockquote>



<p>Discipline, though limited, can help establish habits.</p>



<h4>Establishment of Proper Habits must be Paramount</h4>



<p>Habit will push through even when discipline is lacking.  Habit is nurtured gradually and with a positive mindset it’s powerful when even small successes are rejoiced in.  Making any open-minded habit stick effectively takes a positive attitude, which helps in the creation of a positive association for the process and the goal.</p>



<p>Now that we can see that habits are far more essential to our long-term success than any one-off action, let’s look at the important major habits of successful language learners.</p>



<h3>Habits Specific to Successful Language Learners</h3>



<p><strong>Voracious Appetite for Knowledge.</strong>  “I’m hungry for knowledge” Roger said with a broad smile on his face.   He was a neighbor, with a house on the lot just behind ours.  A stray chicken came in one afternoon to our backyard.  In this city you could raise your own chickens, and sometimes they’d get out.  We wondered if it was from the house behind ours.  I went for a walk and made friends with the neighbors.  Roger was a high school student in the inner city, he wanted to take the GRE so he could continue his life in all the right ways.  I offered to help him prepare for the exam.  We spent a whole Saturday, four hours nonstop, going over a practice exam.  We only went over 3 or 4 long-style questions that had many subquestions.  Overall, we spent about 4 hours on 16 questions and I could see the exhaustion and fatigue in his body, but his mind was relentless.  He really wanted to pass this exam, and meetings with a tutor were rare, so we made the most of it.  I remember discussing what we were most hungry for in life, and Roger’s answer with a huge smile was, “I’m hungry for knowledge.”</p>



<p><strong>Not easily discouraged, Happy to make progress however small</strong>. One part of conditioning yourself to succeed is paying more attention to your successes than your failures, in an emotional perspective.  Your successes should help you thrive and your mistakes should become more manure for the next harvest.  If you couldn’t grow wheat, you need more fertilizer.  It’s that simple.  Don’t flounder.  The rich person’s mindset simply comes with more choices and less beat-yourself-up-in-times-of-failure.  It’s not that wealthy people are necessarily smarter or cooler, they simply don’t fear losing one chip when they have a thousand.  If you feel like you always have one chip and you just lost it, you’ll keep your spirit low and your absorption low.  If you can rejoice in a success, however small, you will raise your spirit and raise your absorption.</p>



<p><strong>Strong willingness to reach out and help new learners.</strong> The most successful people in any domain are often the ones helping others succeed.  Just look at any entrepreneur who is successful and count how many people around them are also successful.  It’s no coincidence, a successful leader, explorer, teacher, and learner reaches out to help those around him or her succeed.</p>



<p><strong>Strong willingness to try and reduce complex concepts to simple information for new learners.</strong> Feynman said try and teach what you just figured out to a child, and that’s a great way to try and learn something well and intuitively.  Crafting and creating language around a subtle concept is a challenge in itself, and those who are relentless find great treasure and wealth in forming the perfect words for the thought at hand.  Break it down so a new learner can understand, and you are probably doing pretty well when it comes to understanding the topic.</p>



<p><strong>Great at establishing small personal rewards for success in process and flow.</strong> I’ve heard of people putting gummy bears after each paragraph in a textbook to reward themselves for reading and reaching a new point.  It’s a genius little reward system.  Take a normal thing that you would normally just devour, like a pack of gummy bears, and turn it into a reward process for reading the textbook.  Got another creative idea?  Leave it in the comments please!</p>



<p><strong>Able to identify positive flow loops and able to reinforce them.</strong> When you find a technique that works, even if it feels boring, stick with it.  If you’re making gains in muscle with a boring routine, stick with it.  It might feel boring, but if your measured progress is increasing, stick with it.  Try to figure out what’s working, and even if you cannot pin it down, stick with it.  One working technique is worth more than an infinitely tall pile of techniques that don’t work.</p>



<p><strong>Creatively tailors approaches based on highest priority items.</strong> For example, you may notice your pronunciation is not connecting even though you know all the words.  You reschedule your lessons around videos and audio that you repeat and sing to yourself to get the pitch down perfectly.</p>



<p><strong>Whiff of the Goal and the Right Attitude</strong></p>



<p>Having a taste or even a whiff of what the goal smells like is nice and can keep you going.  Remember how great things will be when you’re fluent, when you have a great understanding, when you can incorporate yourself into the flux and flow of a whole new culture.  “How good it would be to benefit others, how good it would be to master communication”  these are thoughts that can help align our values with our goals, and help align our actions with our values.  Even thinking a thought like one of these for thirty seconds with a smile has immense benefit, because we’re crafting the right attitude to get the job done.</p>



<h3>Research Findings</h3>



<p>Although the amount of research on successful language learning habits is rare, study habits research has some great info.</p>

<p>Clearly, <strong>asking for guidance when you don’t know things</strong>,</p>



<p><strong>Looking over things you’ve missed or gotten wrong</strong> (doing review),</p>



<p><strong>Making a habit of looking back at your notes in the down-time and off-time</strong>,</p>



<p>And <strong>psyching yourself up</strong> to study every day a little bit,</p>



<p><strong>All of these lead to success.</strong>  Not doing them leads to the opposite.</p>

<p>The popular understanding of aesthetics is perhaps best illustrated by the common definition (from Oxford’s Dictionary of English, 2020 edition):</p>



<p><em>aesthetics (US also esthetics)  </em>                                                                                                                            <br> <em>⁃ PLURAL NOUN [usually treated as singular] </em>                                                                                                     <br> <em>a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty.                                                                                        <br>• the branch of philosophy which deals with questions of beauty and artistic taste.</em></p>



<p>Now what is beauty? Well we can look at that definition too:</p>



<p><em>beauty<br>⁃ NOUN {plural beauties)<br>1 [mass noun] a combination of qualities, such as shape, colour, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight:<br>• a combination of qualities that pleases the intellect: the artistry and beauty of football.<br>• [as modifier] denoting something intended to make someone more attractive: beauty treatment.</em></p>



<p>It’s immediately apparent that the common definitions are viciously circular, aesthetics and beauty are defined in terms of each other! (Technically ‘aesthetic’, without the s, is primarily a verb but that has the exact same issue as the noun)</p>



<p>i.e. going one layer deep, ‘beauty’ <strong>is defined by</strong> beauty ! And ‘aesthetics’ <strong>is defined by</strong> aesthetics !</p>



<p>It clearly doesn’t make sense to define anything like this, let alone the ideas we would like to express by ‘beauty’ or ‘aesthetics’.</p>



<p>So what is the right way to define aesthetics?</p>



<p>Well we can redefine beauty but the simplest way, without throwing out the dictionary, is to define it in terms of a more appropriate word. The word has to be as close as possible to the meaning of ‘beauty’ without the vicious circularity.</p>



<p>There are a few possibilities, the closest seems to be ‘elegance’, not quite the same but without introducing new words into the english language, or using an unwieldy phrase, this seems like the best we can do. Again from Oxford:</p>



<p><em>elegance <br> 
⁃ NOUN [mass noun] <br> 
1 the quality of being graceful and stylish in appearance or manner: a slender woman with grace and elegance. <br> 
2 the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple; neatness: the simplicity and elegance of the solution.</em></p>



<p>Aha! There in the second definition, that is something we can work with.</p>



<p><em>“the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple”</em></p>



<p><strong>That’s the ideal of good design too!</strong></p>



<p>In fact the word ‘elegance’ is already commonly used to describe many things that are primarily considered to be good design. The most beloved Apple products for example.</p>



<p>Now if we replace the word ‘beauty’ with ‘elegance’ in the above definition of ‘aesthetics’ we get:</p>



<p><em>aesthetics (US also esthetics) <br>  ⁃ PLURAL NOUN [usually treated as singular] <br>  a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of elegance. <br>  • the branch of philosophy which deals with questions of elegance and artistic taste.</em></p>



<p>Okay, that mostly works. It captures the vast majority of the meaning when we say this word in everyday life. And when we combine it together:</p>



<p><em>aesthetics (US also esthetics)<br>a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple.</em></p>



<p>That sure sounds about right! Although not ideal it has more explanatory power than the original definition. In short,</p>



<p><strong>Anything with good design has a set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple.</strong></p>

				<p>Meat and dairy production have negative effects on the environment, on our health and on animal welfare. One way to economically quantify these negative effects is with the concept of negative externality. A negative externality is a cost that affects a third party who did not choose to incur the cost. This usually happens when the market price of a good does not reflect the true cost.</p><p>Animal-based food production has an array of negative externalities. Therefore, the true price of buying cheese or beef should be significantly higher. Otherwise, our society incurs those costs in form of environmental damage, health issues and animal welfare problems.</p><p>While it's pretty clear what the negative externalities are, it's very hard to quantify them. Let's see what they are and why they are hard to quantify.</p><h2 id="negative-externalities-from-meat-and-dairy">Negative externalities from meat and dairy</h2><h3 id="environment">Environment</h3><p>Producing meat and dairy has a lot of different negative effects on our environment. Livestock such as cows emit greenhouse gases while they process the food they eat. This is mostly in the form of methane. We use half of the habitable land that's available for agriculture, and 77% of that is either used by livestock directly or to grow crops for them. Agriculture also uses a lot of water, as 70% of the global water is used for it. Furthemore, livestock produce a lot of feces, and that, together with the use of fertilizers, pollute our waters (called eutrophication). Finally livestock agriculture is the leading cause of biodiversity loss and the number one reason for endangering wildlife [1].</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/09/What-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-agriculture-1.png" alt="What are the environmental impcats of food and agriculture?" width="1600" height="1035" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/What-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-agriculture-1.png 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/What-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-agriculture-1.png 1000w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/09/What-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-agriculture-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="health">Health</h3><p>There is an increasing amount of research showing that proteins from plants are healthier than proteins from animals. For example, eating more plant proteins and less animal proteins leads to better cardiovascular health [2].</p><p>The use of antibiotics for animals is the leading cause for resistance to antibiotics in humans. This means that we need to find new medicine or ways to treat diseases that we successfully treat today [3]. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics are used for livestock [4].</p><p>A current example of negative health externality from eating animal-based foods is COVID-19. It's most likely that the virus spread to humans from bats [5]. Obviosuly, bats are not the main driver of livestock agriculture across the world. However, there are enough other examples that might hit closer to home. For example, you might have heard of the mad cow disease or the swine flu [6][7]. Or what about getting salmonellosis from eating pouletry, from which around 280,000 people died worldwide in 2015 [8]?</p><h3 id="animal-welfare">Animal welfare</h3><p>In the US, every year 9.8 billion animals are raised and killed for meat and dairy production [9]. While there exist some farms where animals are treated well, the reality is that most of the dairy and meat is produced in highly industrialized animal factories. Animals are mostly kept indoors, don't have enough space and are not treated well. Even in the case of "good" farms, animals are in the end killed and babies are separated from their mothers. This can't be right.</p><p>One might argue that bad animal welfare doesn't have a negative impact on us as a society, and therefore no negative externality. One would be wrong, though. The market and studies have shown that people are willing to pay more for meat and dairy that comes from animals that had better living conditions. This suggests that bad animal welfare takes some kind of toll on people and they are ready to pay more to make it go away.</p><h2 id="quantifying-the-negative-externalities">Quantifying the negative externalities</h2><p>In theory, this sounds easy. Just add up the costs from the list above. In reality, all we can do is take an educated guess. Let's look at some of the research that has been done in this area.</p><p>One study that looked at pork in The Netherlands estimated that the price of pork needs to be 31% higher to reflect its true price. The authors found that pork needs to be € 2.06 more expensive per kilogramm, and break it down as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-09-at-12.46.46-PM.png" alt="" width="1452" height="384" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-09-at-12.46.46-PM.png 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-09-at-12.46.46-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-09-at-12.46.46-PM.png 1452w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I think the overall cost is in the ballpark, but they underestimate the costs of climate change and overestimate the cost of animal welfare (especially at the upper bound there) [10].</p><p>Another study looked at the negative externalities in New Zealand's dairy industry and found that the incurred costs are higher than the revenues generated from the export of it [11].</p><p>One study that looked only at the global environmental and health costs incurred by eating meat and dairy, estimating them between $ 1 to 31 trillion per year. This is a wide range, and is the result of different methods and scenarios they used to calculate the costs [12].</p><p>While it's hard to predict the exact costs, it's clear that the negative externalities of meat and dairy are not included in their price.</p><h2 id="solutions-to-correct-the-negative-externalities">Solutions to correct the negative externalities</h2><p>A common way of addressing negative externalities is by levying a tax on the product or service. For example, taxes make up 42.5% of the price of a pack of cigarettes in the US [13]. Therefore, less people are willing to buy cigarettes and this is overall better for society because there are less public health costs.</p><p>A tax on meat and dairy would increase its price and most likely lead to less consumption and production. In fact, many countries already have a carbon tax on fossil fuels, but not on animal-based foods [14]. Unlike a pure carbon tax, a tax on meat and dairy would not only include GHG emissions, but also incorporate the other negative externalities discussed earlier.</p><p>Such a tax has been proposed by some researchers. As mentioned above, one study found that the tax would need to increase the price of pork in The Netherlands by 31% to account for all the costs [10].</p><p>In reality, government are doing the opposite. They are subsidizing livestock farmers. The European Union pays around $ 30 billion dollars in direct subsidies to farmers, that's nearly 20% of their whole budget [15].</p><p>Negative externalities can also be corrected by shifting demand. We need more excellent plant-based alternatives to meat, milk and cheese. It's great to see that companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are successful and available at an increasing number of stores and restaurants. But we need more. We need thousands of food companies that are committed to shifting our population to a plant-based diet.</p><p>So, what can you do? Vote for politicians who understand these issues and are committed to solving them. Eat less meat and dairy, instead eat meat and cheese made directly from plants. And, tell your friends and family about the this. Most people don't realize how their diet relates to climate change.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><p>1: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">Environmental impacts of food production (Our World in Data)</a><br>2: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27479196/">Association of Animal and Plant Protein Intake With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality (JAMA Internal Medicine)</a><br>3: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6358/1350">Reducing antimicrobial use in food animals (Science)</a><br>4: <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/are-antibiotics-turning-livestock-superbug-factories">Are antibiotics turning livestock into superbug factories?

        <p>I took these photos while travelling from Pakistan to Switzerland. I flew through Emirates and had to change my flight at Dubai (this allowed me to take some closeups of the metropolis).</p>

<p>The flight route included these countries:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Since we took off from Dubai, I could take some closeups of the metropolis.</p>



<p>These bizzare housing quarters caught my eye. Hundreds and hundreds of clone houses stacked besides each other. I really liked how they alternated the colours.</p>

<div>

<p>Since the airplane was almost empty, I could easily alternate between both sides to take pictures.</p>

<div>

<p>We flew above the Persian gulf on our first strand of the journey. I briefly saw the port of Qatar, before flying close to the seashore of Saudi Arabia. I tried hard to locate the seashore of Iran, but was only able to see a faint glimpse before it disappeared.</p>



<p>I saw quite a few of these on the shore of Saudi Arabia. They might have something to do with water desalination.</p>

<div>
  <div>

<p>Shortly after we entered the airspace of Kuwait. The massive bridge below is called the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway which connects Kuwait city with the outer region. It is the fourth longest road bridge in the world with a length of 36.14 km.</p>



<p>The thin line below is the Kuwait-Iraq border. It was quite strange to see the contrast between a desert and a (somewhat) developed region.</p>

<div>
  <div>

    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

<p>We then flew above Iraq. Although this region was quite dry, I saw this beautiful oasis in the midst of the desert.</p>



<p>I was quite surprised by the road network of Iraq. For instance, this road ran for several miles in the midst of an unpopulated region.</p>



<p>This city was in the north of Baghdad and seemed very well-planned.</p>

<p>From the eastern side of the plane I could see the wondrous Zagros mountains which form Iraq’s natural border with Iran.</p>

<p>The flight above Turkey was fantastic, as the landscapes here were simply stunning.</p>



<p>And then we finally entered Europe. I could not take many photos here since it was very cloudy. The inflight entertainment system in Emirates provided some really useful information regarding the flight, including its current location, speed, altitude, etc. It even allowed displaying video from two outer cameras (although these are not helpful when it’s cloudy).</p>

<p>I did manage to take a nice picture of the amazing Alps before they were hidden beneath the clouds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>This blog post describes the creation and testing of OpenWrt images running
SELinux to improve security. The support is still limited and not ready for any
productive usage, however this post should give a basic idea of its current
state.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Back in November 2019 Thomas Petazzoni sent a <a href="https://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2019-November/025973.html">first patchset</a> adding optional
SELinux support to OpenWrt. Due to the complexity of integrating SELinux into
the OpenWrt build system and missing bits in the patchset, the patches never
made it into the main branch.</p>
<p>In July 2020 W. Michael Petullo gave the patchset a <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/3207">second spin</a>, updated
legacy Python2 to Python3, rebased everything and reworked all change requests
from the reviewers. Special thanks to Daniel Golle. Due to the deep integration
of SELinux inside the operating system special versions of <code>busybox</code>, <code>procd</code>
and <code>f2fs-tools</code> <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/3303">were created</a>, keeping the regular (non SELinux)
images small while allowing to integrate the additional SELinux feature via
package installations.</p>
<h2 id="creating-images">Creating images</h2>
<p>To try SELinux on OpenWrt it is currently required to compile the Kernel with
additional options. There are ideas to provide dual Kernel ImageBuilders with a
regular and a SELinux ready version, however this isn’t ready just yet.</p>
<p>You’ll need a OpenWrt <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/quickstart-build-images">build system</a> and a bit of time!</p>
<p>As of 2020/09 only <code>x86/64</code>, <code>armvirt/64</code> and <code>ath79/generc</code> using a <em>squashfs</em>
filesystem where tested with SELinux, if you use a different target, please
share your results.</p>
<p>The following build options are required:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Global build settings -&gt;
	<span># CONFIG_TARGET_ROOTFS_SECURITY_LABELS=y</span>
	<span>[</span>*<span>]</span> Enable rootfs security labels

	Kernel build options -&gt;
		<span># CONFIG_KERNEL_SECURITY_SELINUX=y</span>
		<span>[</span>*<span>]</span> NSA SELinux Support
</code></pre></div><p>These options will automatically select the package <code>refpolicy</code> to set labels
inside the created <code>squashfs</code> filesystem.</p>
<p>Select the SELinux variants of <code>procd</code>, <code>busybox</code> and (optionally)
<code>mkf2fs</code>. Be sure to deselect the <em>regular</em> versions as there is currently
a dependency error if both variants are selected.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Base system -&gt;
	&lt;*&gt; busybox-selinux
	&lt;*&gt; procd-selinux

Utilities -&gt;
	Filesystem -&gt;
		<span># optional: only if target uses f2fs</span>
		&lt;*&gt; mkf2fs-selinux			
</code></pre></div><h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>The following will run an <code>armvirt/64</code> image:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">BIN_DIR<span>=</span>./bin/targets/armvirt/64

</span><span></span>        -nographic 
</code></pre></div><p>A boot log is written directly to the used terminal and should show lines like the following:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If <code>refpolicy</code> worked all files should received an initial label:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">root@OpenWrt:/# ls -Z

This involves some C programming and should be tackled in the near future. The

context labels.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><hr><p><i>Building a more privacy-centric personal finance dashboard </i></p><p>Over the years I've experienced varying levels of interest and success in monitoring my personal finances. Having played around with <a href="https://www.mint.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mint</a>, <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You Need a Budget</a>, <a href="https://www.marcus.com/us/en/clarity-money" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Clarity Money</a>, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personal Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiller Money</a>, <a href="https://copilot.money/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Copilot</a>...there's no shortage of options when it comes to out-of-the-box dashboards, account monitoring, and tracking against a budget. </p><p>Despite the many options, I always found myself falling back to a spreadsheet — updated manually at the end of every month — to get a complete picture of my finances. Poking around, I learned I wasn't alone. <a href="https://twitter.com/darrenbuckner/status/1287159201203023872" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21853636" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HackerNews</a> are awash with the best spreadsheet to start using after you run into the limitations of personal finance apps. </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fb58616dc-0e05-4a13-9167-4050d8662417%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=269078ed-08e3-4a03-9392-44b3fceaac3c" alt="An image from Notion"><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F50ba3508-3a8d-48ec-82b9-7e46dda35d97%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=8fd55f19-735d-4fba-b0a2-b6c43971c48d" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>So over the last few weeks I set out to build a more privacy-centric personal finance data platform — called <a href="https://github.com/n2parko/abstract-capital" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Abstract Capital</a> — that automates data collection and allows me to build financial dashboards in SQL. </p><p>And with a few hours of setup, you can to!  I've open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/n2parko/abstract-capital" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code here</a> and shared the learnings below.</p><a href="#why-spreadsheets" id="why-spreadsheets"><h2>Why Spreadsheets?</h2></a><p>There were a few reasons why I always ended up opting for a spreadsheet over these finance apps...</p><ul><li><b>Incomplete - </b>My goal is to understand how my financial snapshot is evolving across savings, investments, and spending. I need to be able to review and manage <i>all</i> accounts. I found many apps didn't support all the sources of financial activity. These were typically modern or niche tools, like Venmo, Apple Card, and Coinbase. </li><li><b>Privacy Concerns </b>- To use these apps and build a complete financial snapshot requires providing login credentials (generally username and password) to third-party tools. They mostly use Plaid under the hood to access account info and store  additional data about you and your financial snapshot. It feels pretty icky to type in a bank password in to anywhere but you bank's login page. I don't necessarily want a startup with unknown privacy &amp; security controls having a complete view of my finances.  </li><li><b>Shallow Insights </b>- At the end of all that setup, I didn't find the outputs super valuable. Maybe I'd get a cool visualization of my monthly spending, or an alert that I'd spent a lot on a particularly category, but it was often wrong (e.g. I was getting paid back for a large group purchase that wasn't captured) or didn't provide me with the depth of understanding I was craving. </li></ul><p>The challenge for these apps is that everyone has a different "financial stack" and use case. Some want to save, some want to forecast and inform large purchase decisions. Some have shared household accounts and some keep them separate. Some pay cash, some rely solely on credit cards, and some pay in Bitcoin. Catering to this diversity is hard!</p><a href="#&quot;gimme-the-data&quot;" id="&quot;gimme-the-data&quot;"><h2>"Gimme the Data!"</h2></a><p>So in August 2020, I set out to prototype my own personal finance data platform. Rather than trying to build the <i>next coolest personal finance</i> app, I wanted to focus on getting myself a copy of my financial data. I called the service Abstract Capital 💸</p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe6db823e-8dd7-45f0-809d-58d71f465646%2Fstandards.png&amp;blockId=1ed128ea-9ec2-484f-aade-2eae0321fedb" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>My requirements for Abstract Capital: </p><ul><li><b>Privacy-Preserving</b>: Needs to run in my own cloud account, be open-sourced, and provide me with access to the underlying data</li><li><b>Complete: </b>needs to be able to build a complete snapshot, across all financial data sources</li><li><b>Flexible: </b>make as few opinions about the data and final analysis as possible</li><li><b>Cheap</b>: needs to be cheap to run...don't wanna spend $$$ to monitor $ </li></ul><p>I didn't have to look too far for inspiration. The original premise and environment for <a href="https://segment.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Segment</a> (customer data platform) is similar to the personal finance ecosystem of today. Marketing and analytics SaaS is highly-fragmented, with many tools that focus on different use cases, <i>but all rely on the same underlying dataset</i>. </p><p>Your financial budgeting, forecasting, monitoring, loan application, and dashboarding apps similarly rely on the same data: how much you've saved, how much you've invested, how much you owe, and how much you've spent. </p><p>My goal for Abstract Capital was to automate the extraction and storage of my own financial data, and control which apps and services could access that data.</p><a href="#how-abstract-capital-works" id="how-abstract-capital-works"><h2>How Abstract Capital Works </h2></a><p>Abstract Capital turns out to be a pretty traditional Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) problem. There are a variety of data sources ("financial accounts") that we need to pull data from, lightly massage it into a standard spec ("transactions", "investments"), and send it along to a central data bus that other apps can read from. </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9ab6ff85-9c0a-453b-8466-99e54e868001%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=703c0aec-e177-403f-b39e-31f14be6941d" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>The first (and biggest) problem I ran into was that the financial services I use aren't exactly developer friendly. Bank of America limits their API usage to certified partners and sends you your API credentials via Certified Mail™️. Many of the financial services don't have <i>any</i> public APIs whatsoever. It's a highly regulated industry, providing access to highly-sensitive data, so I don't knock these institutions for not providing a Stripe-level developer experience. </p><p>
Luckily, Plaid has solved the financial accounts access problem. Using Plaid cut against my goal of making Abstract Capital completely free of <i>any</i> third-party services. Plaid is now owned by Visa and is used by companies like Venmo, Coinbase, and Betterment, so I figured I had enough social proof for my MVP.</p><p>Here's how Abstract Capital works...</p><ul><li><b>Auth with Plaid</b>: Run a Plaid app to authenticate into your accounts</li><li><b>Sync: </b>A scheduled sync periodically pulls data from your accounts (via Plaid) and writes collection records to topics in pubsub.

I now own a copy of my financial data, have an up-to-date dashboard I can review, and can write a bit of SQL to dig in to any changes or anomalies. It's empowering. There are additional destinations beyond BigQuery that could be helpful — Airtable, Google Sheets, Twilio (text alerts for large transactions), and TurboTax come to mind. </p><p>I'd love to see more companies take a data- and privacy-centric approach to helping consumers navigate their finances. I believe there's room in the FinTech ecosystem for this type of <i>personal finance middleware</i> to power new use cases. There are more products than ever that are providing consumer financial services, so understanding financial picture is becoming ever more difficult to assemble. And need to be able to provide third-party services access data is also growing —  imagine being able to provide temporary access to your financial data to apply for a mortgage or try out the latest budgeting app. </p><p>Finally, there seems to be an emerging opportunity in helping consumers own their data and run apps in more privacy-preserving ways. Spinning up a BigQuery instance and writing ETL jobs isn't the way <i>most</i> people want to spend their nights and weekends. As deployment models in the enterprise shift from Cloud SaaS to in-VPC ("<a href="https://tomtunguz.com/cloud-prem-architecture/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cloud Prem Architecture</a>"), there seems to be a need on the horizon for a <i>Consumer Cloud</i> that simplifies cloud offerings and allows consumers to deploy personal apps without ceding their privacy and data. </p><p><i>Feel free to share any comments or feedback on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/n2parko" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Twitter</i></a><i>.

<p>Over the past five or so years I have done a deep dive into the depths of Angular, spent hours scouring the React landscape, and now have finally decided to begin scratching the surface of Vue.</p>
<p>Although this will not be a full comparison between the frameworks, where it makes sense I will draw some connections. As cliched as it may sound, they all have their various strengths and weaknesses. However, I do firmly believe that each framework can be used to solve almost any problem.</p>
<h2>Why Vue</h2>
<p>Vue has slowly been building traction over the last six years since it’s release. It has a strong foothold in the open-source community, and being somewhat newer than both React and Angular is has the advantage of choosing from what worked for them.</p>

<p>With the release of Vue 3 just around the corner, I decided it was finally time to give it a try. Anyway, I’ve heard you can’t really call yourself a developer in 2020 without having put thousands of hours diving into <em>this month’s trendy new framework,</em> right? All while still working our 9 to 5, plus attempting to squeeze in a social life, right? Hmm, I guess that’s why we get paid what we do. Jokes aside, I’ve always enjoyed learning new things, and lucky for me, spending time coding as a hobby also ends up helping my career.</p>
<h2>Initial Impressions</h2>
<p>This has to be the highlight of the experience for me. Vue’s first impressions absolutely rock. The documentation is fantastic. It is very easy to read, the interactive examples are great, and the docs just look fantastic.</p>
<p>After skimming through the <em>Getting Started</em> I got up and running with the CLI. And again, what an amazing job they have done there. It has out of the box support for various bundlers, Typescript, PWA’s, CSS pre-processors and a bunch more. Angular’s CLI and Create React App are not too far behind these days, but this for me is still the gold standard.</p>

<p>My first few lines of code were a joy to write. The reusable component structure is very familiar when coming from React, and the separation of styling, scripts, and templates will make any Angular developer feel at home.</p>
<p>All in all, I would say this was the fastest I’ve gone from zero to productive with any framework before. The Vue team has done a great job making the core of the framework very intuitive. It just works as you would expect.</p>
<h2>My Idea - <a href="https://decodr.app/">Decodr.app</a></h2>
<p>After a weekend or so of tinkering, I decided I had seen enough to give it a go with an actual app I had in mind. I am often working with base64 encoded Kubernetes secrets. The issue with these secrets is that they have a mix of plain text and base64 strings.</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code language="yaml">
          <code slot="code">data:
  user: YWRtaW4=
  location: YWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcg==</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
<p>Every site I have found online, a - looks like it was built in the 90s, b - for some unknown reason sends your often private input to a server to get decoded and c - can’t handle partially encoded strings.</p>
<p>So now that I had a problem to solve, it was up to Vue and myself to come up with a nice solution. <a href="https://decodr.app/">Decodr.app</a> is what I came up with.</p>

<h2>The Problem - Typescript</h2>
<p>I think we as developers have all slowly come around to it, but just as a word of warning, this may be my inner Angular developer speaking. Typescript is an absolute must-have. Sure I can spin up something small using JavaScript only (this blog for example), but just the safety net Typescript offers, plus the much-improved developer experience with IntelliSense / code autocomplete and type safety is something that can’t be understated.</p>
<p>Now how does Vue fit into this?</p>
<p>Up until now, Vue has primarily been a Javascript first framework. It has supported Typescript but it has always seemed like a second class citizen. With the much-anticipated release of Vue 3, most of the internals have been rewritten and optimized for Typescript.</p>
<p>Now I can’t comment too much of the Vue 2 Typescript experience as I have jumped straight into the release candidate version of Vue 3. My quick one-line summary of Typescript in Vue 3 is - <em>Although it works it’s not fantastic.</em></p>
<h3>Options API</h3>
<p>Using the more common Options API you quickly realise where the shortfalls happen. Typescript excels with functional code as well as more object oriented Class based code. Here you can very simply and explicitly type functions and variables</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code language="typescript">
          <code slot="code">function lowercase(text: string): string {
  return text.toLowerCase();
}

// OR

class MyClass {
  text: string;

  lowercase(text: string): string {
    return this.text.toLowerCase();
  }
}</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
<p>Inference works great here as the Typescript compiler can very easily see what type things should be by simply tracking the reference of the object (Class, function or Object) or primitive (most variables).</p>
<p>Vue however wants us to put all our logic into a reasonably complicated component object -</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code language="typescript">
          <code slot="code">defineComponent({
  props: {
    name: String,
    success: { type: String },
    callback: {
      type: Function as PropType&lt;() =&gt; void&gt;,
    },
    message: {
      type: Object as PropType&lt;ComplexMessage&gt;,
      required: true,
      validator(message: ComplexMessage) {
        return !!message.title;
      },
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    const firstName = this.name.split('')[0];
  },
});</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
<p>Attempting to type this code has quickly added a ton of bloat. In this block of code around 200 of the 300 characters are all Typescript related. Why is this you ask?</p>
<p>Take just this snippet for example -</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code language="typescript">
          <code slot="code">props: {
  name: String
},
mounted() {
  const firstName = this.name.split('')[0]
}</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
<p>To the compiler, this is not very straight forward. Vue does some internal magic to link the <code>props.name</code> property so that it can be used within the <code>mounted</code> property. For this reason Vue will always require a bunch of extra typing related info and processing power to correctly infer the types. Even with this my VS Code would often bug out with Typescript related errors. Nothing a quick reload wouldn’t fix, but either way it is not a great experience.</p>
<h3>Composition API</h3>
<p>A much anticipated feature recently added to Vue’s core feature set is the Composition API. It is primarily being pushed as a better way to structure larger Vue files, by grouping related logic together. But in addition to this it also improves Typescript support.</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code language="typescript">
          <code slot="code">const Component = defineComponent({
  props: {
    message: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  // We can write a lot more logic directly in this property.
  // That's a 👍 from the TS compiler
  setup(props) {
    const result = props.message.split('');
    const filtered = props.message.filter((p) =&gt; p.value);
  },
});</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code>
<p>In short (very short) it allows us to moves a bunch of logic directly into the setup function. We can now declare all computed and watched variables, as well as various helper and lifecycle method using a more direct functional syntax. This lets us use the Typescript compiler and any inference it can do much more directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I briefly gave the Class Component API a go and was impressed. There is quite a bit of debate around it long term sustainability in the Vue ecosystem, but after some more reading I am relatively confident that it is here to stay for the next while. I do plan on giving it a more thorough try in future projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Nail in the Coffin</h3>
<p>The Composition API seems to have solved most of the pain points from the Options API when it comes to Typescript support. Having said that though, there is still one major issue I have left until last.</p>
<p>Vue does not fully support type checking in templates.</p>
<p>Yes I know there is some experimental Vetur support for it. But as the name says, it is very experimental. My experience was hit or miss at best. Close to one in three files would bug out and need a reload when using it.</p>
<p>Now I know we are all tired of <em>rEaCt vS VuE Vs aNgUlAr</em> but If I have to make one comparison it’ll be here. Angular has recently started supporting template type checking, and as with all things Typescript in the Angular world, it just works. On the React side, the Typescript support in JSX is pretty first-class. Being a superset of Javascript means that IntelliSense works as expected. Not so much in Vue. I can not count the number of times I have attempted to ctrl/cmd-click on a component tag to try go to the component definition. Only to realize this is not supported out of the box.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong. Vue is fantastic. For me to write multiple paragraphs hammering away at a single problem says volumes about the quality of the rest of the framework.</p>
<p>And who knows. Maybe things will change once Vue 3 leaves preview and the community begins to dig its hands into it and provide some feedback. The Typescript documentation may improve drastically, and maybe the template type checking may be bumped up the priority list.</p>
<p>So, will I be using Vue again anytime soon? Absolutely. Simple as that.</p></section></div>]]>

September 13, 2020 | https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/using-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/788dc194cc59b1493e2352e986e456a771d17e5d/0bc81/img/next-js-with-wordpress-part-2-blog-post.png" alt="Blog article on connecting WordPress as a headless CMS to Next.js"></p>
<p>In <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js" title="Setting up WordPress as a headless CMS with GraphQL support">part one of using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js</a>, we looked at the basics of setting up a WordPress instance so that we can access Posts and Pages and custom content via GraphQL using the Next.js framework. We also created a new Next.js app using the <code>create-next-app</code> tool.</p>
<p>For part two in the series, we're going to take those starting bases and connect the dots to supply content data from WordPress via the WPGraphQL plugin and access it in our Next.js project.</p>
<p><em>If you like this article, you'll love the other helpful content I post on Twitter.</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode" title="Find me on Twitter @kendalmintcode"><em>Find me on Twitter @kendalmintcode</em></a> <em>and say hi.</em></p>
<h2>Cleaning up the new Next.js project</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js" title="Part one of setting up WordPress as a headless CMS with GraphQL">in part one, we created a new Next.js application</a> using the <code>create-next-app</code> tool. I'd recommend going through the steps in part one first, to get that set up before continuing along here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the box, the <code>create-next-app</code> provided by Next.js adds in a lot of helpful stuff as a starter for ten. However, we can remove some of the cruft to get us down to a basic build and limit any possible confusion.</p>
<h3>Files to delete</h3>
<p>Open up the project from part one in VS Code (or your favourite IDE) and delete the following files and folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>/pages/api</li>
<li>/pages/api/hello.js</li>
</ul>
<h3>Files to edit</h3>
<p>Next, we need to amend the <code>/pages/index.js</code> file. This is the main entry point, our home page, for our app. At the moment, it's crammed full of Next.js guides and links and other helpful, but unwanted markup, so let's clear it out.</p>
<p>Open up <code>/pages/index.js</code> and locate the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element in the component. Replace everything between the open <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/main&gt;</code> with the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1 className={styles.title}&gt;Welcome to our demo blog!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  You can find more articles on the{' '}
  &lt;Link href='/blog'&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;blog articles page&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/Link&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you've used React Router, you might be familiar with the rather unique-looking way that we're linking to the <code>/blog</code> page. Next.js uses a similar internal routing component as React Router to link to internal pages, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Link href='/blog'&gt;
  &lt;a&gt;blog articles page&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/Link&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link" title="Next.js Link element">read more about the Next.js Link element</a> here, but the essence is that you need to declare the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component and add a <code>href="/link-to-your-page"</code> attribute with the path to where you want to link to. Finally, you need to add a single <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor element with whatever name you want to use for the link.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you should add any class names or other typical anchor attributes you wish to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag <em>not</em> the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component.</p>
<p>One last thing to do here and that's <strong>import the <code>Link</code> component</strong>. Add the following to the top of the <code>/pages/index.js</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>import Link from 'next/link';
</code></pre>
<p>With that done, the entire <code>/pages/index.js</code> file should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import Head from 'next/head';
import Link from 'next/link';
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    &lt;div className={styles.container}&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Create Next App&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;main className={styles.main}&gt;
        &lt;h1 className={styles.title}&gt;Welcome to our demo blog!&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You can find more articles on the{' '}
          &lt;Link href='/blog'&gt;
            &lt;a&gt;blog articles page&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/Link&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;footer className={styles.footer}&gt;
        &lt;a
          href='https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&amp;utm_medium=default-template&amp;utm_campaign=create-next-app'
          target='_blank'
          rel='noopener noreferrer'
        &gt;
          Powered by{' '}
          &lt;img src='/vercel.svg' alt='Vercel Logo' className={styles.logo} /&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Files to add</h3>
<p>Of course, we need a couple more files that we'll build out over the course of the article. These will handle our blog post routing and data handling, interacting with our WordPress backend.</p>
<p>Add the following folders and files within them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folder <code>/lib</code> - put this in the root of the project. This will hold any utility files and specifically our API file that will talk to WordPress.</li>
<li>File <code>/lib/api.js</code> - this will handle our GraphQL queries and data fetching.</li>
<li>Folder <code>/pages/blog</code> - nothing fancy here, just a folder to hold our blog pages.</li>
<li>File <code>/pages/blog/index.js</code> - when people visit a route like <code>https://somedomain.co.uk/blog/</code> this is the page that will serve that request.</li>
<li>File <code>/pages/blog/[slug].js</code> - similar to the above, this rather weird looking page will handle individual blog pages, e.g. a domain like <code>https://yourdomain.com/blog/an-interesting-article/.</code></li>
<li>File <code>/styles/Blog.module.css</code> - this is a standard CSS file that will hold styles for our blog list items.</li>
<li>File <code>/.env.local</code> - an environment variable file to hold</li>
<li>File <code>/styles/Blog.module.css</code> - a modular</li>
</ul>
<p>That odd looking file name, <code>[slug].js</code> looks really unfamiliar, but it's how Next.js determines dynamic routes within a folder.</p>
<p>We'll cover that next.</p>
<h2>Dynamic routing in Next.js</h2>
<p>Before we start building out our new pages, it'll be helpful to quickly highlight how dynamic routing in Next.js works.</p>
<p>Out of the box, without doing anything fancy, Next.js will try to match any route you throw at it to a <code>.js</code> file that it finds under the <code>/pages</code> folder in your project.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code> will match <code>/pages/index.js</code></li>
<li><code>/blog/</code> will match <code>/pages/blog.js</code> or <code>/pages/blog/index.js</code></li>
<li><code>/contact/thanks</code> will match <code>/pages/contact/thanks.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, when it comes to dynamic routes, such as a blog post or product page, we might have one physical page file that acts as a template of sorts, handling an unknown amount of routes.</p>
<p>For this, Next.js will match a filename in the format <code>[param]</code>. So, in our case above where we have the file path <code>/pages/blog/[slug].js</code>, Next.js will call the <code>[slug].js</code> page for the following routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/blog/my-awesome-blog-post</code></li>
<li><code>/blog/another-great-post-title</code></li>
<li><code>/blog/some-final-title-here</code></li>
<li>...and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can call this dynamically routed file whatever you like between the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> characters, but you'll be referencing this name inside the file (as you'll soon see), so it makes sense to call it something meaningful. In our case 'slug' is the terms that WordPress uses, so we'll leave it as that.</p>
<p>It's worth looking at the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes" title="Official documentation on Next.js dynamic routing">official Next.js documentation on dynamic routing</a> to familiarise yourself with the syntax and conventions to apply them to your app/site.</p>
<h2>Fetching data with the api.js file</h2>
<p>Now for the real meat and potatoes of the article: fetching data!</p>
<p>There's no right way to build out your files in a project like this, but I tend to prefer building things in a least-dependent to most-dependent order. In our case, the data-fetching isn't dependent on anything else, but the UI-layer depends on this, so it makes sense to start here.</p>
<h3>Dealing with environment variables</h3>
<p>Some things, like global variables that might change between environments are best stored in (funnily enough) environment variable files, usually created as <code>.env</code> files in the root of your project.</p>
<p>Since we've already created one such file, let's populate it with our WordPress GraphQL URL. Open up the file <code>/.env.local</code> and add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>    WP_API_URL=http://demo.robkendal.co.uk/graphql/
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can use my URL as above, but note that a) it might be taken down without notice, and b) you may not get the results you want. It's always best to get your own WordPress instance. Either way, you'll want to add in the url in the format <code>http://your-domain-here.com/graphql/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next.js comes with built in support for environment variable files. You just have to add a <code>.env.local</code> file in the root of your file and add in what you need. As always, the Next team have <a href="">great docs on environment variables</a> for you to peruse.</p>
<h3>Adding the general fetching function</h3>
<p>Open up the <code>/lib/api.js</code> file and let's start adding in our data-fetching magic. The first thing is to add the general fetch function that will handle the talking to our WordPress GraphQL endpoint.</p>
<p>At the top of the file, we'll reference our API URL we just added into the <code>.env</code> file, followed by the <code>fetchAPI</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>const API_URL = process.env.WP_API_URL;

async function fetchAPI(query, { variables } = {}) {
  // Set up some headers to tell the fetch call
  // that this is an application/json type
  const headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' };

  // build out the fetch() call using the API_URL
  // environment variable pulled in at the start
  // Note the merging of the query and variables
  const res = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables })
  });

  // error handling work
  const json = await res.json();
  if (json.errors) {
    console.log(json.errors);
    console.log('error details', query, variables);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch API');
  }
  return json.data;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is an asynchronous function as we need to wait for the <code>fetch()</code> call to complete. The rest of the comments should be enough to walk you through the file.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is the most complex function in our API file. Whilst not the longest, it does have more moving parts. The upcoming functions we'll be defining next largely outline GraphQL queries that the <code>fetchAPI()</code> function here will handle.</p>
<h3>Add function to get blog post listings</h3>
<p>From here on out, we'll define our GraphQL queries that will shape the data we want back from WordPress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> the best approach to defining GraphQL queries is to fire up the GraphiQL plugin on the WordPress instance, write your query, test the results and then copy it into your API file. That way, you know it works and hopefully eliminate errors along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as queries go, this is quite straightforward. We're looking at all posts, grabbing the first 20 results (for brevity), and ordering them by descending date order.</p>
<p>With these exception of the <code>extraPostInfo</code> ACF custom fields <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next.js" title="Part one of configuring WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js">we defined in part one of this series</a>, the rest of the data is standard WordPress data, such as title, id and the slug of the post.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I made a lot of mistakes at my first software job.  We all do, mistakes are a natural part of growing.  However where I particularly screwed up was how long I persisted and stayed at my organization.  I stayed for 5 years - that’s a long time for your first job!   During those 5 years the company went through a lot: an acquisition, two rounds of layoffs, talented senior engineers fleeing the company, the organization being switched into ‘<a href="https://davidcummings.org/2012/05/03/look-out-for-harvest-mode-saas-startups">harvest mode</a>’, our CEO and GM being charged and fined by the SEC for fraud, a failed AWS migration, and another change of leadership.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this, I stayed.  I commiserated with coworkers, and listened when they tried to convince me to leave.  I even took a few calls here and there for other roles.  But no matter what, I stayed.</p>

<p>It wasn’t compensation keeping me - unfortunately compensation increases in our industry tends to come from job hopping, not staying in one place.  It was doubt.  Every time I thought about leaving, I was plagued with it.  Was it the right decision?  Was I missing out by leaving?</p>

<p>Here are some of the doubts I’ve had over the years, and why they’re unfounded.  Deciding to leave a job is hard.  Hopefully one of these will help you better approach your situation.</p>

<h3 id="i-cant-leave-now---the-company-is-improving">I can’t leave now - the company is improving!</h3>
<p>If you’ve stayed at a company during its downward spiral, you know that it’s hard to give up.  You’ve spent so much time at the organization, you feel invested in its success.  It’s natural to get FOMO.  “What if I leave and the company begins to turnaround?”</p>

<p>I’ve listened to this fear and persisted through the whole process, from the downward trajectory all the way to the business turnaround.  <strong>It’s not worth it</strong>.  It’s a long process that takes <em>years</em>.  To be a part of it isn’t a grand adventure - it’s a hard slog.</p>

<p>In my experience the turnaround takes place by leaning on engineers to push out more features.  All the technical and infrastructure debt that’s holding your organization back?  Even after the turnaround you likely won’t be able to tackle the majority of it.  It’ll still be there.</p>

<p>To top it off - during the turnaround, you won’t be compensated well.  If you’re unhappy with your compensation now, just wait until three years later.  Your peers at other companies will be earning tens of thousands of dollars more than you, just because you made the decision to stay and they didn’t.</p>

<p>There’s no sunshine at the end of the rainbow here.  The process of turning a company around is a brutal one.  Don’t commit yourself to it lightly.</p>

<h3 id="the-acquisition-wont-be-that-bad--leadership-is-telling-us-its-fine">The acquisition won’t be that bad!  Leadership is telling us it’s fine</h3>
<p>I’m sure they are.  Being acquired is usually terrible.  There can be good acquisitions, however my opinion is that they are few and far between.</p>

<p>Regardless of it’s outcome, every acquisition is acompanied by the senior leadership team telling everyone that everything will be fine.  They’ll do it across every communication channel possible, in person 1x1s, all hands meetings, emails.  Common refrains include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“The acquisition makes us stronger than before!”</li>
  <li>“For the vast majority of you, nothing will change”</li>
  <li>“They’ll only be a slight consolidation of similar roles”</li>
</ul>

<p>These are mostly lies.  Usually the senior leadership team of the company getting acquired are being paid a lot to reassure people.  Most leaders will be compelled to stay by ‘golden handcuffs’, an equity grant that keeps them at their role for a year to provide stability during the transition.  Afterwards they’ll likely quickly leave, bringing their favorite talent along with them.  Watch what they do, not what they say.</p>

<p>Take an acquisition for the sign that it is, that the combined company is likely not going to be a place you want to work at.  Don’t make my mistake - leave.</p>

<h3 id="everyone-else-is-leaving-i-have-a-responsibility-to-stay-and-fix-things">Everyone else is leaving, I have a responsibility to stay and fix things</h3>
<p>No, you don’t.  Unless your organization is actively saving lives, or you own it, you have to keep in mind: <strong>your number one responsibility is yourself.</strong>  You likely have a partner, family or community you need to provide for.  To do that well, you need to focus on making sure you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enjoy your work</li>
  <li>Are compensated well</li>
  <li>Work reasonable hours</li>

<p>Your entire organization is not your responsibility.  Have the courage to change the things you can, but accept the things that you can’t change.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>You’re going to have a long, tiring career ahead of you if you spend it trying to fix broken organizations.  Wouldn’t you rather leave and work to build something great instead?</p>

<h3 id="but-the-tech-bubble-is-going-to-crash-any-moment-now---what-if-i-get-laid-off-and-cant-find-a-job">But the tech bubble is going to crash any moment now - what if I get laid off and can’t find a job?</h3>
<p>This plagued me during every job search - “But what if the economy crashes and I get laid off from my new role?”</p>

<p>This actually happened to a friend of mine - they left our company for a new job.  Within a few months of joining the new company Covid-19 hit, and they were laid off.  However they talked to friends at our company and got hired right back on a new team.  Most likely with a compensation increase!  It’s so common we have a term for it, a boomerang hire.</p>

<p>As for me, I started my job search during the full brunt of Covid-19 in Spring 2020.  I had more recruiter calls, job leads, and opportunities than I could keep track of.</p>

<p><strong>There’s always a market for good talent</strong>.  If you know that you are good at what you do, even during a downturn there will be people who desperately want to hire you.  Don’t let the fear of disaster keep you from reaching out for something more.</p>

<h3 id="but-the-people-i-work-with-are-amazing">But the people I work with are amazing!</h3>
<p>I’m sure they are.  There’s also amazing people at other companies.  Would you accept a job at a company where you didn’t like your interviewers?  Doubtful.  Trust that you’ll steer yourself towards another place with wonderful people.</p>

<h3 id="ive-built-so-many-relationships-that-help-me-get-my-job-done--am-i-really-going-to-throw-those-all-away">I’ve built so many relationships that help me get my job done.  Am I really going to throw those all away?</h3>
<p>Yes, you will.  You’ve built these relationships before, and you’ll build them again at a new role.</p>

<p>Also, you are not throwing them away!  Those relationships will last a lifetime and will be an invaluable source of future job opportunities as well as referall hires for you.  Keeping in touch is easy nowadays.</p>

<h3 id="my-team-wont-be-able-to-survive-without-out-me">My team won’t be able to survive without out me!</h3>
<p>Ego, ego, ego.  Teams are incredibly resilient things.  While a key member leaving will often throw things out of balance, with time teams will hire and heal themselves.  Often a senior person leaving gives a more junior engineer an opportunity to step up that they wouldn’t otherwise have.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-choice">Make the choice</h3>
<p>There are benefits to staying during a tough period for a company.  However, the opportunity costs (the loss of potential gains from alternatives) are likely far higher.
Trust your gut if it’s telling you to leave, and find the role that’s right for you.  Our lives are finite, spend it doing something you love.</p>

<p>
Normalizing and standardizing are the common concepts in statistics which help the data to bring under a common shelter without changing the relative difference between the different values present in data.</p><p>
Does that sound odd? Donâ€™t worry keep going and you will know what I am talking about.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/0KKGBsN/Main-Images-1.png" alt="Normalizing or Standardizing distribution " title="Normalizing or Standardizing distribution " src="https://i.ibb.co/0KKGBsN/Main-Images-1.png">
</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-want-to-normalize-the-distribution">Why do we want to Normalize the distribution</h2>

<p>
Letâ€™s first start with the <code>why</code> and then move to the further questions.</p><p>
The values present with different features can vary a lot. For example, a <code>is_old</code> can have binary values(0 and 1) on the other hand a feature like <code>cost</code> can have values ranging from <code>$100</code> to <code>$10000</code> depending upon the item under consideration.</p><p>

If we donâ€™t normalize/ Standardize your dataset feature having more range will contribute more toward the learning leading to bias in the model. In the above example, the <code>cost</code> value will contribute more toward the trained dataset.</p><p>
We generally normalize values when feature are present in the dataset having different range.</p>
<p><em>Normalization</em> doesnâ€™t lead to change in the real range of the dataset.</p>
<p><em>Standardization</em> leads to reduction of dataset between values in such a way that mean of the distribution is set to 0 and standard deviation is set to 1.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-normalize-standardize-distribution">How to normalize/ standardize distribution</h2><p>
A standard way to normalize a distribution is to apply this formula on each and every column.</p>
<p>
$\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$
</p>
<p>
This will distribute the values normally and reduce all the values between 0 and 1.</p><p>
For standardization, we use the following formula,</p>
<p>
$\frac{x - x_{mean}}{x_{standard_deviation}}$
</p>

</p><p>
As we can already see that the data in the data frame is not standardized, if we donâ€™t normalize the data the outcome will be fairly different and we wonâ€™t be able to get the correct results.</p><p>
We can understand this concept in more detail if we think in terms of neural networks. Letâ€™s say we have a dataset and we are trying to find the salary of the employees given some features like, years of experience, grades in high school, university and salary in last organization different other factors.</p><p>
Now if we keep the data as it is, some features having higher values will get higher importance. So, to give a fair chance to every feature to contribute equally toward the model initially( with fixed weights), we normalize the distribution.</p><p>
Sklearn provides a very simple way to standardize your data.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>sklearn.preprocessing</span> <span>import</span> <span>StandardScaler</span>

<span>sc_df</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>sc_transform</span><span>)</span>

<span># Now you can safely use sc_df as your input features.

</p><p>
This standardization uses the values of mean and standard deviation to calculate the new as opposed to the one of the basic <code>min-max</code> approach we discussed earlier.</p>

This is how <code>MinMaxScaler</code> works in sklearn.</p>

</p><p>
The idea behind preprocessing modules in Sklearn is that, you can fit with any given data and then transform some different data to change the data according to one on which you fit it.</p><p>
So, it is a general practice to fit the <code>StandardScaler</code> on the train data and transform on both train and test data.</p><p>

<p>There's an <em>excellent</em> piece up on Fast Company by Steven Melendez about my Kickstarter campaign to pre-sell audibooks of my next novel, as a way to demonstrate the viability of publishing audio without caving to Audible/Amazon's mandatory DRM policy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90549199/why-this-author-is-taking-a-stand-against-amazons-audiobook-monopoly">https://www.fastcompany.com/90549199/why-this-author-is-taking-a-stand-against-amazons-audiobook-monopoly</a></p>
<p>Melendez does great work laying out the case for refusing DRM, and the risks to publishers and writers in allowing Amazon to lock their works to its platform (it's a felony to remove DRM or provide the tools to do so, even if you own the copyright to the DRM-locked work!).</p>
<p>Reading his piece, it strikes me that I could do a better job for laying out my theory of change here – how preordering the audiobook could actually lead to a fairer world where power shifts away from Amazon (owners of Audible) to the creators of audiobooks.</p>
<p>Obviously most authors couldn't do what I'm doing. I've been publishing books since 2000, more than 20 of 'em, with several NYT bestsellers. This particular book is the sequel to two <em>massive</em> bestsellers with huge, dedicated followings.</p>
<p>Publishing lives and dies on this kind of book. One of the major reason that publishers publish "midlist" books and first novels is in the hopes that they'll "break out" and become perennial bestsellers that subsidize the next round of risky bets on midlist and first books.</p>
<p>So while this isn't a typical kind of book, it's an important one.</p>
<p>So let's say this does really well in audio, selling, say, 10,000 copies. That works out really well for me, as I'm the publisher for this one, because I keep 95% of that (Kickstarter gets 5%).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doctorow/attack-surface-audiobook-for-the-third-little-brother-book</a></p>
<p>By contrast, if my publisher sold this with Audible, they'd get 70% (Amazon takes 30%), and then I'd get 25% of that (17.5% of the gross). That means I earn 542% of what my take would be with a publisher/Audible on these sales.</p>
<p>So my profit on 10,000 self-published, Kickstarted audiobooks is roughly equivalent to 54,200 commercial books sold through Audible. I had to pay to produce the audiobook and put in a hard month's work on promoting the KS, but that still a great upside.</p>
<p>So that's one way things could change. Frontlist writers could demand to retain their audio rights in publisher negotiations and do what I did. It's hard work, and only a minority of writers are situated to do it, but it would make sense for some of 'em.</p>
<p>And that would definitely make a dent in Amazon's business: they're a hit-driven biz, too. If a big chunk of major books were "Audible exclusive" (that is, sold everywhere EXCEPT Audible), they'd feel the pinch, first in lost revenues and then in lost subscribers.</p>
<p>After all, once the presale campaign is over, this book will be for sale everywhere EXCEPT Audible: libro.fm, downpour.com, even Google Play. All of those stores have stock and plans that are basically identical to Audible.</p>
<p>And if they amass sizeable collections of exclusive-of-Audible bestsellers, there will be good reasons for customers to defect to them from Audible.</p>
<p>But what about the publishers? Well, maybe they won't release their frontlist authors' audiobook rights – but if they can make <em>much</em> more money by working <em>with</em> authors to presell their audiobooks, <em>and</em> weaken Amazon's stranglehold over their business…why wouldn't they?</p>
<p>In this scenario, authors and publishers do (better-than-retail) revenue shares for a crowdfunded, DRM-free presale campaign, again diverting the bestselling titles from Amazon/Audible, once again driving support for retail alternatives to Amazon.</p>
<p>One advantage I haven't mentioned yet: shifting away from Audible is <em>great</em> news for libraries, since neither Audible originals, nor Kindle originals, are available <em>at all</em> for library purchase. Imagine a publisher <em>boycotting libraries</em>!</p>
<p>And here's the theory-of-change part: realistically, not selling through Amazon means that a lot of readers and listeners won't encounter your work – even if you make more money overall, this is not ideal.</p>
<p>My end-game is for Amazon to make good on the promise it made in 2008 when it bought Audible: to drop its DRM (or at least make it optional!). That way, readers who buy their audiobooks from Amazon can change retailers without abandoning their expensive audiobooks.</p>
<p>That alone won't end Amazon's dominance (we'll need meaningful antitrust enforcement for that), but without that step, competition doesn't have a hope in hell.</p>
<p>We MUST end the situation where every dollar spent on our books at Audible is a dollar our readers will have to throw away to switch to a rival.</p>
<p>We can do that, and we don't need every writer to be in a position to refuse Audible to make it happen.</p>
<p>We just need to starve them of the books from their most popular authors – and happily, those authors stand the best chance of making <em>more</em> money by doing crowdfunders for pre-sales.</p>
<p>If bestsellers like me do this, we'll make more money <em>and</em> we'll make the world better for <em>all</em> authors.</p>
<p>And one more bonus: I'm using the crowdfunder to presell ebooks (and sell ebooks for the previous two volumes – 4,000 ebooks in five days (and counting).</p>
<p>I'm the retailer for these ebooks, so I get 30% off the top, send the remaining 70% to my publisher, and they send me 25% of that back as a royalty: that means I get 47.5% of the gross on these.</p>
<p>And they're ebooks that are sold without enriching Amazon.</p>
<p>That's my fiendish plan – my plan to be the pebble that starts the avalanche that moves the mountain.</p>
<p>You can help! A $15 pre-order for the audiobook (list price $25!) will help to change the world:</p>

<p>Reality has a well-known leftist bias. If you want to convince people that inequality, high carbon emissions and austerity are good for them, you need to get them to abandon reality.</p>
<p>That's actually easier than you'd think.</p>
<p>Reality is hard to know. Are 737 Maxes safe? Should you wear a mask? Are vaccines safe? Is your kid's distance ed any good?</p>
<p>These are all questions that can only be answered by mastering multiple disciplines, reviewing the literature, checking the math in the papers, etc.</p>
<p>To know reality, we rely not on experts, but on expert <em>processes</em>: the regulatory truth-seeking exercises in which neutral experts hear competing claims from other experts and adjudicate them, showing their work and disqualifying themselves if they have conflicts.</p>
<p>Maybe you can't evaluate microbiology claims, but you should be able to figure out whether the process they used to arrive at those claims was fair, neutral, transparent, and subject to review when new evidence emerges.</p>
<p>If you want to make the truth unknowable, you don't start by convincing people of wrong things, you start by making it hard to know whether <em>anything</em> is true.</p>
<p>Look at Vladislav Surkov, who was Putin's long-serving disinformation guy.</p>
<p>Surkov's signature move was boasting that he secretly funded <em>some</em> opposition groups, but never saying which ones were inauthentic and which ones were the true opposition.</p>
<p>Whenever a opposition group came out with a claim about Putin, instead of arguing about the claim, people would argue about the group's authenticity. They didn't just disagree on what was true: they disagreed on how anyone could know if something WAS true.</p>
<p>Writing in the Desmog Blog, Tom Perrett runs down the history of the Koch brothers' "academic philanthropy," showing it to be a series of shrewd investments in in Surkov-style disinformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/09/12/charles-koch-academic-george-mason-utah-state-university">https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/09/12/charles-koch-academic-george-mason-utah-state-university</a></p>
<p>Koch executives call this "investment in intellectual raw materials" that support its corporate goals.  Koch investments in the Mercatus Center at GMU and the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State and elsewhere have paid off handsomely.</p>
<p>A quarter-century of expensively purchased scholarship has created an epistemological chaos that support denial about economic fairness, the climate emergency, a public sphere, and other obvious facts that are now, incredibly, in doubt.</p>
<p>Perrett: "Koch funding in academia and think tanks has broader implications for policy implementation, as state governments routinely rely on the state university systems to provide independent analyses of issues before the legislature and agencies, and advocacy groups use academic findings to bolster lobbying and public campaigns."</p>

<p>Even if you don't know his name, chances are you've seen Matt Bors's incredible cartoons for The Nib, especially this classic panel from his enduring 2016 "Mr Gotcha" strip:</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/mister-gotcha-4-9faefa-1.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/craphound.com/images/mister-gotcha-4-9faefa-1.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><a href="https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha/">https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha/</a></p>
<p>Its currency and fame are easy to explain: Mr Gotcha is a superb example of the odious neoliberal idea that there are no systemic problems (or, importantly, solutions), only individual choices.</p>
<p>Don't like climate change? Recycle.</p>
<p>Don't like monopolies? Shop indie.</p>
<p>Don't like inequality? Donate to charity.</p>
<p>Don't like racism? Don't be racist.</p>
<p>Don't like sexual assault? Don't rape anyone.</p>
<p>This framework is a recipe for despair, self-loathing and inaction, and Bors's Mr Gotcha is the perfect avatar for it.</p>
<p>Four years later, Bors has brought back Mr Gotcha for a very special covid edition:</p>
<p><a href="https://thenib.com/mr-gotcha-covid/">https://thenib.com/mr-gotcha-covid/</a></p>
<p>Mr Gotcha starts off by with a reiteration  of the current right-wing disinformation meme.</p>
<p>Before Bors widens the frame to include apologism for police murder.</p>

<p>Spaced repetition (or SR) is a highly effective method of remembering information. The <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#spaced-repetition">Anki Manual</a> says this about the discovery of spaced repetition:<sup id="fnref:manual"><a href="#fn:manual">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
 <p>This was a revolution in learning, as it meant material could be learnt and retained with the absolute minimum amount of effort necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is the most popular spaced repetition software (or SRS). At its heart, Anki is just a program for making and displaying flashcards, but the flashcards are shown to you on a schedule – ideally, close to the same day as you would have forgotten the card, and no sooner. This means you can remember more information in less time than with traditional study methods.</p>
<p>There are many SRS programs but I use and recommend Anki because it’s simple, available for all platforms, syncs easily, and has a lot of additional functionality available through <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/">plug-ins</a>. It also has many shared decks (pre-made sets of flashcards) available<sup id="fnref:shared"><a href="#fn:shared">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although this post is Anki-specific, a lot of the information will surely apply to other SRS programs as well. And while I’m primarily using Anki for language-learning, the basic principles that I’ll talk about are fairly universal.</p>
<p>Can we start the post or what?</p>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep It Simple,</h2>
<p>Stupid! Cards should be as simple as you can make them, containing only some core, atomic bit of information.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons you don’t want to complicate your cards:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Anki is meant to be efficient. That is the entire reason to use an SRS system as opposed to traditional study methods. If your studying isn’t efficient, you are wasting your time and missing the point. You should only spend a few seconds per card before moving on to the next card.</li>
 <li>Getting one small part of a complicated note wrong means you have to mark the whole thing wrong. The way I see it, there’s no alternative. When you get the card wrong, however slightly, you can’t just mark it “Okay” – you will be learning and reinforcing wrong information. To avoid this situation entirely, simply avoid cards with a lot of information. Short phrases and idioms are okay.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a <strong>sentence you’d like to learn</strong>? Break it up into <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-deletion">clozes</a>. Again, the problem with things like full sentences is the risk of getting a single word out of the whole thing wrong. Clozes work by <em>occluding</em>, or hiding, only the parts of a sentence that you want to learn – and each occlusion will have its own separate card. Now you have an atomic bit of information to answer each time! You also get to see the information in its proper context as you study. It’s simple and it’s effective.</p>
<p>Have a <strong>list of things</strong> (all US states in alphabetical order)? Stop. Anki isn’t meant for that – really! I see people trying to shoehorn SRS systems for all kinds of purposes, thinking that since it’s efficient, it can be used for everything, and in the process actually making their studying wildly inefficient and wasteful. I think Anki is simply the wrong tool for lists most of the time. Methods such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">memory palace</a> seem more appropriate here.</p>
<p>A lot of shared decks in particular get this simplicity thing wrong, which is part of the reason you should…</p>

<p>Shared decks are pre-made sets of cards that are available to download on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">Anki’s website</a>. I suggest you avoid using them as much as possible.</p>
<ol>
 <li>You will be learning things out of context. It is crucial to study information only after encountering it out in the wild. For example, I tried learning that the Polish word for <em>magpie</em> is <em>sroka</em>. Trouble is, I had no idea what a magpie looked like, and could never memorize the word <em>sroka</em>. After seeing one in the wild, I was able to memorize the word instantly.<sup id="fnref:course"><a href="#fn:course">3</a></sup></li>
 <li>The card quality is generally quite low. A lot of shared decks I’ve seen pack a lot of information into each card, in the mistaken notion that this <em>improves</em> the quality of the cards – it does not. These are <em>low-quality cards</em>. Cards should be simple, so you do <em>not</em> want this extraneous information when studying.</li>
 <li>Another way in which shared decks tend to be low quality is that their cards are sometimes, well, wrong. I’ve noticed this in a lot of separate shared decks. Now, if you make your own cards you’re also liable to end up with bad information, which is dangerous because you will very efficiently learn… the wrong thing. Still, if you make your own cards based on something you’ve already learned (i.e. with the proper context), you’ll be easier able to spot if what you’re learning isn’t right. If you learn from a shared deck without this context, you’d have no idea. As a result of blindly learning from shared decks I still have some wrong bits of information stuck in my brain, like candy wrappers under the sofa.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s what’s bad about shared decks – so what’s good about making your <em>own</em> decks? Well, making your own cards will help you remember them. I can’t prove that, but it’s pretty common sense. It’s a lot like note-taking – in addition to preserving knowledge for later, the act of writing itself helps you learn.</p>
<p>Apart from that, designing your own notes will force you to <strong>be selective in what information you choose to learn</strong>. Adding cards takes time, and that’s a <em>good</em> thing. It’s way too easy to download a deck and start learning thousands of notes, but it’s a big mistake, because you should…</p>
<h2 id="be-frugal-with-cards">Be Frugal With Cards</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to get overexcited when starting out with Anki and add hundreds of cards about every little thing. But remember, each card that you add costs you time, time which adds up over the long term across many reviews. It’s easy to add a lot of cards when you are new to Anki and have a blank slate, but when you wind up with hundreds of cards scheduled each day, you get a lot more picky about what info you want to learn. I made this mistake early on and I delete cards more often than I add them now. Choose your cards carefully.</p>
<h2 id="take-care-when-reversing-cards">Take Care When Reversing Cards</h2>
<p>Most of you already know the importance of studying cards both ways. If you want to learn the Italian word <em>mela</em>, for example, it’s not enough to have a card <code>la mela -&gt; the apple</code>; you need to be able to produce the Italian word given the English word, as well. Most language learners have realized this, especially those that only learned one way and found that they could understand a language, but not speak it themselves.</p>
<p>The temptation is to automate the process of creating reversed cards and Anki makes it easy for you: you just have to select the “Basic (and reversed card)” note type when adding a new note. However, I’ve run into a lot of problems with this in the past. The word <em>whip</em>, for example, can translate into two different words in Polish: <em>bicz</em> or <em>bat</em>. Either answer is correct, so going from English to Polish I can have a card <code>whip -&gt; bicz, bat</code>. However, I don’t want to reverse that and have <code>bicz, bat -&gt; whip</code>, because here I’m only required to remember one of the words and not both. I can guess what <code>bicz</code> means if I know <code>bat</code>. So it’s better to have two cards here: <code>bicz -&gt; whip</code>, and <code>bat -&gt; whip</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, it takes more work to do things this way, but that’s fine. Making cards shouldn’t be seen as a waste of time as it helps you to learn. By deciding that a piece of information is important it primes your brain to learn it, and then your brain has to work to formulate a structure for this bit of knowledge, in the form of a note.</p>
<p>One thing you <em>do</em> miss, though, is that making cards separately results in them not being <em>related</em>, as they would be if they were generated from the same note (i.e. a “Basic (and reversed card)” note). Related cards are not shown on the same day, as you’d presumably still have the answer from the first related card fresh in your head when seeing subsequent ones. I don’t know of a good solution to this other than manually burying subsequent cards that display the same information – burying reschedules a card for the next day. A handy shortcut for this is the <code>-</code> key.</p>
<h2 id="uze-clozes-liberally">Uze Clozes Liberally</h2>
<p>I already mentioned <a href="https://www.bytedude.com/getting-the-most-out-of-anki/#keep-it-simple">clozes</a> in the context of minimizing the amount of information per note. Here are a few more reasons you should use them:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Clozes give context. It’s more effective to learn a word in the context of how it’d be used in real life. <code>Pasame [...](the apple)</code> is a better way of learning <em>la manzana</em> than <code>the apple -&gt; la manzana</code>.</li>
 <li>Clozes can help distinguish between subtle differences, e.g. for learning when to use different synonyms.</li>
 <li>Clozes are also great for learning words that don’t make sense on their own, such as prepositions. These pretty much require a context to learn them in.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="use-the-speed-focus-mode-add-on">Use The Speed Focus Mode Add-On</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you should be going through cards <em>quick</em>. That’s the point of an efficient study system. To ensure you don’t spend too much time on a single card, use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1046608507">Speed Focus Mode</a> add-on. I set it up so that I get an alert after five seconds on one card, and it auto-reveals the answer after eight seconds. If I couldn’t get the answer by the time it’s revealed, then I simply didn’t know it well enough and I mark it Wrong. The reason I set such high times is that many of my cards are, unfortunately, not very optimized for simplicity (see above). I’m slowly simplifying my cards, but I have thousands of them. Ideally I wouldn’t ever spend more than three or four seconds on one card.</p>
<h2 id="get-comfortable-with-the-hotkeys">Get Comfortable With The Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Anki has hotkeys to make your studying faster, so make good use of them! You can read about them in the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#keyboard-shortcuts">Anki manual</a>. My favorites are hitting <code>B</code> to bring up the browser and <code>A</code> to add a card. I also use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1310550323">Right-Hand Reviews</a> add-on which adds a few more hotkeys for studying with the right-hand, as well as the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/992946134">Answer Key Cascade</a> add-on which makes the answer keys more ergonomic to use (and is compatible with Right-Hand Reviews).</p>
<p>It’s always great when a program is super-user friendly (and Anki is worth being a super-user of).</p>

I realized these ideas apply to all ages, so I thought I'd share them with you.</p><p>Hereâ€™s what I tell them: </p><p><strong>Your goal is curiosity</strong></p><p>I donâ€™t think grades are important.</p><p><em>(This gives them a bit of a shock, and their mom raises an eyebrow, but I forge on)</em></p><p>You can do so much more than whatâ€™s expected of you. <em>Just</em> getting good grades wonâ€™t have you feeling like youâ€™re becoming the person you want to be.</p><p>I want you to make great friends and explore. Create games, music, launch businesses, play, investigate, talk to that girl, do whatever drives you. Those experiences forge your character and teach you in uncountable ways</p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>Think about how much of your time is spent on status games. The most leveraged, creative work comes when youâ€™re</em> <a href="https://www.stopa.io/post/230" target="_blank"><em>following your taste</em></a><em>. Are your goals just about the status game, or something bigger?</em></p><p><strong>But grades are your day job</strong></p><p>You still want to get good grades though. This keeps your options open, gives you chances to learn new things, and keeps people from asking too many questions.</p><p>At this point, they invariably say: <em>Butâ€¦some courses Iâ€™m just not interested in â€” when will X be useful, etc</em> </p><p>Treat this as your day job and a challenge. Whatâ€™s the minimum time you need to spend to get the grade you want on those courses? </p><p>If you focus on the challenge, a lot of your time will be spent figuring out creative solutions and productivity hacks. This itself will be more fun than the course, help you build discipline, and learn techniques that will be useful to you throughout life.  Remember, you just want to do a good job so you can be that inventor, renaissance explorer, hacker, or artist that you want to be. </p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>Before google came around, search was boring: a â€œsimpleâ€� technical problem that no one wanted to solve anymore. Google turned it into a very interesting problem. Think about how you could do that to some of your grudging must-do tasks.

Be wary of combining bad characteristics with good ones. You can get good grades <em>and</em> be a good person. </p><p>Learn to catch yourself doing this, because it will happen all the time in your life. Now itâ€™s grades, but tomorrow it may be â€œRich people are evil, Iâ€™m not evilâ€�. </p><p>You may feel good about yourself, but if you follow this idea, you wonâ€™t get what you want. Instead, ask the question: â€œHow can I get good grades and *not kiss up?â€� Find people like that and learn from them.</p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>Anytime you want something that you donâ€™t have, this thinking will materialize. â€œOh people who are fit spend so much time in the gym, Iâ€™m not that kind of personâ€�, etc etc. Be careful about the constraints you set with your ideas.</em></p><p><strong>Be wary of all or nothing thinking</strong></p><p>Slave morality can get hard to swallow, so they may say â€” <em>but grades are unfair. Even if I do well the teacher can knock me for â€œparticipationâ€�, thatâ€™s why the kiss-up people get good grades.</em></p><p>Youâ€™re right. This is frustrating and unfair. And thereâ€™s a reason some people kiss up: itâ€™s easier to do that. But, just because some parts are unfair and some people cheat, doesnâ€™t mean you should give up on what you want. The world isnâ€™t so black and white.</p><p><em>Tell yourself: you will do whatâ€™s under your control.</em> Learn from the people you admire who behave the way you think is right. Yes some people have an advantage, yes some things are plain unfair, but you can still get what you want. If you do all of that and it doesn't work, you'll know you tried your best, and something better will certainly happen regardless. </p><p><em>Adult Aside â€”</em> 
<em>I remember Ramit Sethi telling the story of someone who wanted to start working out, but only had one day free a week. Instead of working out once a week, they didnâ€™t work out at all.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Once I realized that <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/">my attention was even scarcer than my time</a>, I became an anti-distraction fanatic. During my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">weekly reviews</a> I methodically went through my past week, figured out what had been distracting me, and tried to eliminate it or replace it with something less distracting.</p><p>Over time, this has led me to find lots of tools (and ways of using my tools) that help me stay more focused. Here are some of the things I’ve started doing:</p><figure><img width="73" height="73" src="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/slack_hu9a9f5beab477f5d6455ea073c0ec506a_21261_146x146_resize_box_2.png" srcset="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/slack_hu9a9f5beab477f5d6455ea073c0ec506a_21261_146x146_resize_box_2.png 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/slack_hu9a9f5beab477f5d6455ea073c0ec506a_21261_73x73_resize_box_2.png"><figcaption>Anxious yet?</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>I <em>aggressively</em> disable notifications and badges so that I don’t mindlessly open distracting apps. If you’re into eliminating distractions you’ve probably already done this. But if you haven’t, it’s by far the most important thing you can do to improve your focus, so I’m putting it first anyway.</p><p>I have a zero-tolerance notification policy: if an app interrupts me, I ask myself whether the interruption was valuable, and if not, the app doesn’t get to notify me anymore. This has weeded out pretty much everything except for inboxes (phone, texts, reminders) and apps with a human on the other end (ride sharing, delivery).</p><p>A special dishonorable mention goes to Slack, which can easily suck away a quarter of your time without you noticing. If you use Slack and you haven’t disabled the “unread messages” badge, stop reading this post and do it now. (Consider setting a two-minute timer to remind you to quit in case you get distracted by checking your unreads, like I did while taking the screenshot above.)</p></li><li><p>On the subject of Slack, I try to keep it closed as much as possible and check it in batches a few times a day. Not all workplace Slack cultures allow this, but if yours does, I highly, <em>highly</em> recommend it. Doing this led to my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/50pct">biggest single quantifiable productivity improvement</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I only check my email once per day.</p><p>Gmail filters send important email to a label called “Temp Inbox” and the rest to a label called “Unimportant.” I check Temp Inbox each evening and Unimportant once a week. Since incoming email doesn’t go to the inbox, I can open Gmail to compose or search messages without getting distracted by unread messages.</p><p>(I use <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/inbox/">a piece of Google Apps Script</a> for this, but I think the Gmail UI has improved recently so that you can now do something similar with filters and it’ll have decent ergonomics.)</p></li><li><p>I have a second monitor that always shows a <a href="https://complice.co/?r=6ct6ukjyqf" target="_blank">Complice</a> window with the task I’m currently working on. (Complice is my favorite app for making lists of what I want to do today.) This helps me recover quickly from unintentionally going down rabbit holes.</p><img width="512" height="145" src="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/complice_hud9dd0579ba03395b10f5550a0290b118_133053_1024x290_resize_box_2.png" srcset="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/complice_hud9dd0579ba03395b10f5550a0290b118_133053_1024x290_resize_box_2.png 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/complice_hud9dd0579ba03395b10f5550a0290b118_133053_512x145_resize_box_2.png"></li><li><p>I use <a href="https://a.paddle.com/v2/click/447/116794?link=46" target="_blank">Focus</a> to break my habit of mindlessly checking sites.</p><p>For websites that are habit-forming but still feel useful on net, like Twitter or Hacker News, Focus lets me restrict my usage to certain times of day. It’s the only website blocker I’ve used that lets me <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/zero/">fully automate</a> blocking things in the exact way I want.</p><p>It’s especially important for me to use a website blocker that’s fully automatic, because the times when I need it most are exactly those times at which I have the least willpower to do any manual steps!</p></li><li><p>I also block most websites on my phone (using the iOS built-in content blocking in whitelist mode). Unfortunately, this works less well than Focus since I sometimes want to disable it and then forget to re-enable it.</p></li><li><p>I <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/krss/">do most of my Internet reading on my Kindle</a> via <a href="http://kindle4rss.com/" target="_blank">Kindle4RSS</a>.</p><p>Using RSS means I’m in control of my own feed and don’t need to visit an <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/skinner/">adversarially distracting</a> site like Facebook to get new reading material.</p><p>It’s also helpful that the Kindle delivery comes once per day at a predictable time, so I don’t have an urge to check over and over again for new content.</p></li><li><p>I <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/ublock/">block distracting parts of websites</a> with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank">uBlock Origin’s</a> amazing “element blocker,” which lets you select and remove any part of the page. As a fan of minimalism in web design, I really enjoy being able to adversarially enforce it on any rogue webpage.</p><p>For instance, I use it to block the clickbaity “hot network questions” sidebar on Stack Overflow, which otherwise frequently distracts me, as well as the useless notifications and left sidebar:</p></li></ul><p><img width="300" height="191" src="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/so_before_hu4c17283b85ae39c0aa61b0459ebf639c_1002753_600x382_resize_box_2.png" srcset="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/so_before_hu4c17283b85ae39c0aa61b0459ebf639c_1002753_600x382_resize_box_2.png 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/so_before_hu4c17283b85ae39c0aa61b0459ebf639c_1002753_300x191_resize_box_2.png">

Witch can display separate app windows separately, only display windows from the current workspace, and supports <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/autocomplete/">text search on window titles</a> so that you can search directly for the window you want without having to skip over.</p><img width="612" height="141" src="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/witch_hu67410178f274942d783676016cd30ef5_192544_1224x282_resize_box_2.png" srcset="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/witch_hu67410178f274942d783676016cd30ef5_192544_1224x282_resize_box_2.png 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/witch_hu67410178f274942d783676016cd30ef5_192544_612x141_resize_box_2.png"><p>I found Witch slightly unintuitive to configure, so if you’re curious, here are screenshots of my configs: <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/witch-actions.png">“actions” tab</a>, <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/witch-advanced.png">“advanced” tab</a>.</p></li></ul><figure><img width="82" height="177" src="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/phone_hu55da1dd6cea9817316278c34442dff94_216758_164x354_resize_box_2.png" srcset="https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/phone_hu55da1dd6cea9817316278c34442dff94_216758_164x354_resize_box_2.png 2x, https://www.benkuhn.net/focustools/phone_hu55da1dd6cea9817316278c34442dff94_216758_82x177_resize_box_2.png"></figure><ul><li><p>I’ve hidden the apps on my phone. My homescreen looks like the figure on the right.</p><p>The two folders are “badges” (for the few apps that are allowed to notify me) and “everything else.” If I want an app I type its name in the search bar, which forces me to be intentional (and is often faster than hunting through pages of apps anyway). The app in the bottom bar is the Kindle app.</p></li><li><p>I use native versions of web apps instead of keeping them open in a browser tab. This allows me to use the app without getting sucked into my browser. There are two ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><p>Some apps (e.g. <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank">Roam</a>) are already “installable,” meaning that they tell your browser how to turn them into a native app. (Sadly, Chrome seems to be the only browser that can install installable apps on desktop right now.)</p></li><li><p>For the rest (e.g., oddly, most Google web apps), I use a command-line tool called <a href="https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier" target="_blank">nativefier</a> to turn them into desktop apps.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In fact, right now I’m trying out a “no browser tabs at all” rule. I noticed that I’d sometimes get distracted by tabs that I’d opened a long time ago and should have closed, but forgot about. So I installed an extension to limit each window to a single tab and changed Firefox to <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.link.open_newwindow" target="_blank">open links in a new window by default</a>. (This has lots of synergy with a powerful window switcher like Witch.)</p></li></ul><p>Each of these is small on their own, but <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">like many of the things I work on during weekly reviews</a>, they’ve added up and compounded to make it much easier for me to spend my attention in ways I want.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>If your workplace culture <em>doesn’t</em> allow you to keep Slack closed, because it requires quick Slack responses, this is a bad sign. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article></div>]]>

<h3 id="-abominable-types">⛄ Abominable Types</h3>
<p><em>“There is a dark corner of the type system that is little known other than to compier writers…”  <br>
– <a href="https://twitter.com/alisdairmered">Alisdair Meredith</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0172r0.html">Abominable Function Types</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/abominable.jpg" width="200px">An <em>abominable</em> function type is the type produced by writing a function type followed by a <em>cv-ref</em> qualifier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>abominable</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>abominable</code> names a <em>function type</em>, <em>not</em> a reference type, and despite appearances, is neither a <code>const</code> nor a <code>volatile</code> qualified type. There is no such thing as a <em>cv-qualified function type</em> in the type system, and the abominable function type is something else entirely.<br>
Note that it is <strong>impossible</strong> to create a function that has an abominable type!
<br clear="left"></p>

<p><em>“The only examples I have of explicitly writing these types fall into the category of showing off knowledge of the corners of compilers, and winning obfuscated coding contests.<br>
I have not yet encountered the following idiom in real-world usage outside of such scenarios.”  – ibid</em></p>

<em>Mwahahahah…</em></p>

<h3 id="-aliens">👽 Aliens</h3>
<p><em><strong>Bishop</strong>: No, the hard-wiring between here and there was damaged. We can’t <strong>align</strong> the dish.<br>
<strong>Ripley</strong>: Well, then somebody has got to go out there, take a portable terminal, and patch in manually.<br>
– Aliens 1986</em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/aliens.jpg" width="200px">Stretching it a bit thin so forgive my “silly” typo, and let’s mention <code>alignas</code> (which when squinting hard enough you might just read as <code>aliens</code>) and its kin. The <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/alignas"><code>alignas</code> keyword specifier</a> was introduced in C++11. It specifies the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object#Alignment">alignment requirement</a> of a type or an object.</p>

<p><em>Every object type has the property called alignment requirement, which is an integer value (of type <code>std::size_t</code> and always a power of 2) representing the number of bytes between successive addresses at which objects of this type can be allocated. The alignment requirement of a type can be queried with <code>alignof</code> or <code>std::alignment_of</code>. The pointer alignment function <code>std::align</code> can be used to obtain a suitably-aligned pointer within some buffer, and <code>std::aligned_storage</code> can be used to obtain suitably-aligned storage. Each object type imposes its alignment requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment (with larger alignment requirement) can be requested using <code>alignas</code>. In order to satisfy alignment requirements of all non-static members of a class, padding may be inserted after some of its members.</em></p>

<p>🎃</p>

<h3 id="-demons">👹 Demons</h3>
<p><em>“Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to having <strong>demons</strong> fly out of your nose.”<br>
– John F. Woods, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.std.c/ycpVKxTZkgw/S2hHdTbv4d8J">comp.std.c 1992</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/demon.jpg" width="200px"> The most notorious and infamous of all is probably the Nasal Demon of <strong>Undefined Behavior</strong>.<br>
With its ancient origins in the C language, it predates many of the other members of this list. Nevertheless, it is still an ever present threat and terror to the unsuspecting journeyman.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">short</a>, <em>Undefined Behavior (UB)</em> renders the <em>entire</em> program meaningless if certain rules of the language are violated.</p>

<p>A lot has been written about UB. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr">John Regehr</a> has a facinating <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">series on UB</a> and an <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1520">update on Undefined Behavior in 2017</a> too. His <a href="https://youtu.be/v1COuU2vU_w">two</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/TPyLrJED0zQ">part</a> CppCon 2017 <a href="https://youtu.be/v1COuU2vU_w">“Undefined Behavior in 2017”</a> videos are online too.</p>

<p><strong>STARTLING NEW EPIC:</strong> In Sept. 2017, the Demon showed it still has what it takes when a short UB snippet went <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6xeqr3/compiler_undefined_behavior_calls_nevercalled/">viral</a>:</p>

<p>That is, the compiled program executes <code>rm -rf /</code> even though the original program never calls <code>EraseAll()</code>! However, Clang is allowed to do this since the function pointer <code>Do</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> as it is a static variable, and calling <code>0</code> invokes undefined behavior – but it may seem strange that the compiler chooses to generate this code. It does, however, follow naturally from how compilers analyze programs…</p>

<h3 id="-dll-hell">👿 DLL Hell</h3>
<p><em>“There is no greater sorrow then to recall our times of joy in wretchedness.”<br>
― Dante Alighieri, Inferno</em></p>

<div><p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/hell.jpg" width="200px"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL Hell</a> is a term for the complications that arise when working with dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used with Microsoft Windows operating systems.<br>
DLL Hell can manifest itself in many different ways in which applications do not launch or work correctly. Like Dante’s Inferno <a href="http://historylists.org/art/9-circles-of-hell-dantes-inferno.html">Circles of Hell</a>, DLL Hell is the Windows ecosystem-specific form of the general concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">Dependency Hell</a>.</p></div>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/duckula.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"><em>Duck typing</em></a> is an application of <em>The Duck Test</em> in type safety.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test"><em>The Duck Test</em></a> is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning"><em>abductive reasoning</em></a>.<br>
This is its usual expression:</p>

<p><em>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.</em></p>

<div><p>“Classic” Duck Typing requires that type checking be deferred to runtime and is mostly relevant to dynamically typed languages (unlike C++). However, templates or generic functions or methods apply the duck test in a <em>static</em> typing context.  </p><p>

In fact, one of the main reasons for C++ Concepts (if/when) they finally land, is to bring a more disciplined approach to template type specification and … well..</p></div>

<p><em>“Unknown objects are <strong>operating</strong> under intelligent control…<br>
It is imperative that we learn where UFOs come from and what their purpose is…” <br>
– Admiral Hillenkoetter, First CIA Director 1960</em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/ufo.jpg" width="200px">C++20 may see the invasion of a new operator into the language:<br>
<strong>The &lt;=&gt; Spaceship Operator!</strong><br>
This is a single, 3-way comparison, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator, that once defined allows the compiler to automatically generate all other comparison operators: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>. It provides a consistent interface and support for partial ordering and other goodies.</p>

<p>Walter E. Brown gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/_PKpyD6Ba1s">lightning talk</a> about it at CppCon 2017 and the latest proposal is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0515r2.pdf">P0515R2</a>.</p>

<p><em>“Only a lone foe could pierce that cordon; once inside, he would have to move by stealth, and strike with power and suddenness. I chose that mission.”<br>
-– The Shadow, <a href="http://thelivingshadow.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Magazine_Vol_1_131">Shadow Magazine #131 1937</a></em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/shadow.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing">Variable shadowing</a> occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (e.g a block, a function) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner identifier is said to mask the outer identifier. This can lead to confusion, as it may be unclear which variable subsequent uses of the shadowed variable name refer to, which depends on the name resolution rules of the language. In each scope, the same name or identifier may refer to a different variable with a completely different type.<br>
Variable shadowing is by no means limited to C++.</p>

<p><em>“Hasta la vista, baby!” <br>
– Terminator</em></p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/terminator.jpg" width="200px">C++ provides surprisingly numerous ways for a program to terminate. These include both normal and unexpected termination.<br>
When writing robust software and libraries, it is important to be be aware of the various ways your code might abruptly end. Similarly, many of these conditions might occur at module-boundaries such as DLLs.<br>
Amongst the standard C++ program terminators we find: multiple flavors of <code>std::exit()</code>, <code>std::abort()</code>, <code>std::terminate()</code>, <code>std::signal()</code> and <code>std::raise()</code>.</p>

        <p>For a long time, I’ve been interested in how different folks can use the same programming language in radically different ways. I’ve privately used the term “dialects” to describe these different approaches. In this series, I want to talk about recognizing dialects in code and how we can make them work for us.</p>

<p>Before we get into concrete benefits though, let’s focus on dialects, where they come from and how they find their way into our code.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-bad-theory">The Big Bad Theory</h2>
<p>Telepathy doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>To communicate our thoughts, we need to encode them into language. The process of encoding thoughts into a language produces an artifact, like written text, spoken words, sign language, subtle facial expressions or even a combination of these.</p>

<p>This artifact is always an imperfect copy of the author’s original thoughts. You can say “X is like Y” or “I am sad today” but this is always a simplification that doesn’t have the exact connotations, knowledge or context that remain in your brain.  Those thoughts remain hidden to us. Sharing the full state of your brain would take too long, be too complex and might not be possible since the other person still has their own thoughts.  Like saving a JPEG, encoding a thought into a language is always a lossy process. The artifact that comes out of the encoding process is different than the thought that went into it.</p>

<p>The advantage of artifacts is they <em>can</em> be shared. By simplifying our thoughts, we reduce the information we’re transmitting to a managable amount. Sometimes the thought even becomes clearer because we’ve simplified it. Artifacts can also be communicated or stored for further use. That’s a huge advantage.</p>

<p>On the other side, the person consuming the artifact will understand it differently depending on their own thoughts, experiences and knowledge. I could say something like “Monads are monoids in the category of endofunctors.” This might be a concise, correct statement but how you perceive it depends on your knowledge of functional programming knowledge, or recognizing it as a meme/joke, or just how you feel about me in general.</p>

<p>Language has rules but they’re very fuzzy rules on both the creating and receiving side.</p>

<h2 id="now-in-code">Now in Code</h2>
<p>The same is true for programming. When we begin writing code, we have an idea we want to express, like a rough sketch of an API, or a fix for a bug, or a full fledged model. If we want to automate the execution of that idea, we need to express it in a programming language.</p>

<p>Programming languages tend to offer less expressiveness than natural languages. That means it takes extra effort to encode information in them and it takes a lot of contextual knowledge to understand the authorial intent. On the flip side, programming languages are significantly less ambiguous than natural languages. If expressing an idea in English is like saving a photo as a JPEG, expressing an idea in code is like saving a photo as a GIF with max 256 colors: you lose detail but gain conciseness.</p>

<p>That tradeoff allows a computer to execute our idea with incredible speed and accuracy, which is a heck of a thing.</p>

<h2 id="information-through-convention">Information Through Convention</h2>
<p>The loss of information about business requirements or programmer intent still presents a major challenge for maintenance and future development. We can work around this by supplementing the code with discussion and documentation, and teams frequently do. However, the code itself remains one of our most vital and useful artifacts. Even very human centric methodologies like Domain-Driven Design acknowledge code as the primary artifact your team uses.</p>

<p>So to help preserve our mental well-being, programmers created practices, tricks, and conventions to help impart more meaning into code.</p>

<p>For example, long-term PHP’ers may remember that classes didn’t always have visibility modifiers for properties or methods. This was frustrating when writing a class because things could change or be called in unexpected ways and it was frustrating when using a class because it wasn’t always clear which things you should or shouldn’t touch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// If a user changes the name property directly here, the changed name may get saved</span>
<span>// in the database but it will fail to change the lastUpdated time. Oops!</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>$name</span><span>;</span>

    <span>function</span> <span>name</span><span>(</span><span>$name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>$name</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lastUpdated</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To work around this, PHP borrowed an existing convention that private or protected class features should be prefixed with an underscore. By adding and understanding this convention, we can convey extra information that prevents bugs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Here the _ tells the user “don’t change this property directly” so </span>
<span>// hopefully they’ll scroll farther down and find the name() method</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>$_name</span><span>;</span>

    <span>function</span> <span>name</span><span>(</span><span>$name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>$name</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lastUpdated</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It may seem crude today but for developers at the time, this convention added a lot of safety and intent to the code. You could rely more readily on autocomplete without having to read the entire class and that was a big productivity gain.</p>

<p>Still, it wasn’t perfect: you couldn’t differentiate between protected and private. Some folks tried a double underscore, others did it the other way around and most didn’t differentiate between the two at all. Eventually, this was formalized into the PHP language itself as public/protected/private visibility modifiers which is now the most widely used way of expressing this.</p>

<p>Most practices will never end up as part of the core language itself. They’ll remain userland conventions like a variable naming scheme, a specific directory structure, a preference for one design pattern over another, etc. And that’s good, userland conventions are typically cheaper to produce and iterate on. Even features that make their way into the language itself (our visibility modifiers) may change or even be removed. Languages are always in motion, evolving towards the future.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-dialect">Enter the Dialect</h2>
<p>Over time, these practices group, combine, split and merge into semi-stable clusters which are used and recognized by a group of people. Keeping with our “Programming languages as a language” metaphor, I refer to these groups as “dialects” of the programming language.</p>

<p>In human language, a dialect is a version of a language (say, English) with its own grammar, vocabulary, idioms and other other features. For example, I’m originally from the Southern part of the US where we say “y’all” and “over yonder”, which is unique to our region.</p>

<p>Dialects within the same base language are usually still intelligible to each other. I can communicate with folks from the US Midwest who have their own dialect. I may have more trouble with someone from the UK who speaks Cockney but given time, we can probably work it out.</p>

<p>All of this is true for programming communities as well. Different communities will have unique practices, unique ways of combining them and occasionally different difficulty levels in understanding each other, even if they’re using the same programming language.</p>

<p>Because of its wide variety of uses, PHP has a host of dialects and like human languages, most are associated with and propagated by a community of some kind. The boundaries between dialects can be blurry, as they’re essentially artificial, but it can be useful to talk about. We can identify them by a particular framework (Laravel vs Symfony dialects), a product (Drupal vs Wordpress dialects). It can be generational (PHP devs from before 2010), geographic (PHP’ers from The London School of TDD), or even comparative (“Java-style” PHP). A dialect can be as small as one person (a personal style) or as large as several million.</p>

<p>It’s important to realize that just as with natural languages, there is no “true” dialect of a programming language. Even a standardized dialect is still just a dialect. Therefore, when we talk about encoding our thoughts into an artifact, we’re doing this by applying not just a language but a specific dialect of that language and that will impact the resulting artifact, i.e. code.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-dialects-impact-my-code">How do dialects impact my code?</h2>
<p>Even something as simple as naming a class is impacted by our choice of dialect. Let’s say you had a class that receives an event and dispatches it to 0 or more listeners. Would you go with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>EventDispatcher</span>
<span>class</span> <span>DispatchesEvents</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>EventDispatcher</code> is probably the most common choice, as the bulk of dialects I’ve seen name classes after nouns. That said, there are communities in PHP that prefer to name classes after the responsibilities that class has, using a form that focuses on verbs. It’s a very distinctive choice and like my use of “y’all”, it’s often a good clue as to the origin of the code I’m looking at.</p>

<p>As we said before, both dialects are equally valid, there is no right or wrong choice here! However, confusion arises when consumers of the artifact are unaware of the implicit rules of the dialect used or, worse, apply conventions from the wrong dialect.</p>

<p>For example, in some communities, the verb-first form is never used for classes but is used for traits. If I’m looking at a file tree of a library and assume that <code>DispatchesEvents.php</code> is a trait, that can confuse my understanding of the overall library.</p>

<p>So, should we value mutual intelligibility of dialects above all else and always use the most common convention? There’s certainly value in that but allowing changes like this is a key element in innovation. It’s a balancing act and heavily dependent on the intended audience for our code. Is this only used in a specific team? Will it be a widely consumed library? Is it mainly consumed as a binary without ever looking at the code?</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example. You need to iterate over a list of numbers and perform some operation to each of them. How do you prefer to iterate over them?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>$i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>$i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>$list</span><span>);</span> <span>$i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>

    <p>Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/orange_8361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Tsai</a></p><p>This is a cross-post blog from <a href="https://devco.re/" target="_blank">DEVCORE</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://devco.re/blog/2020/09/12/how-I-hacked-Facebook-again-unauthenticated-RCE-on-MobileIron-MDM/" target="_blank">ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆè«‹å�ƒé–±é€™è£¡</a></p>
    <p>Hi, it’s a long time since my last article. This new post is about my research this March, which talks about how I found vulnerabilities on a leading Mobile Device Management product and bypassed several limitations to achieve
        unauthenticated RCE. All the vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor and got fixed in June. After that, we kept monitoring large corporations to track the overall fixing progress and then found that Facebook didn’t keep up
        with the patch for more than 2 weeks, so we dropped a shell on Facebook and reported to their Bug Bounty program!</p>
    <p>This research is also presented at <a href="http://hitcon.org/2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HITCON 2020</a>. You can check the slides <a href="https://hitcon.org/2020/slides/How%20I%20Hacked%20Facebook%20Again!.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    
    <p>
        As a Red Teamer, we are always looking for new paths to infiltrate the corporate network from outside. Just like
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/#infiltrating-corporate-intranet-like-nsa---pre-auth-rce-on-leading-ssl-vpns-15545" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our research in Black Hat USA last year</a>, we
        demonstrated how leading SSL VPNs could be hacked and become your Virtual “Public” Network! SSL VPN is trusted to be secure and considered the only way to your private network. But, what if your trusted appliances are insecure?
    </p>
    <p>Based on this scenario, we would like to explore new attack surfaces on enterprise security, and we get interested in MDM, so this is the article for that!</p>
    <h2 id="What-is-MDM">
        <a href="#What-is-MDM" title="What-is-MDM"><i></i></a>What is MDM?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mobile Device Management, also known as MDM, is an asset assessment system that makes the employees’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BYOD</a> more manageable for
        enterprises. It was proposed in 2012 in response to the increasing number of tablets and mobile devices. MDM can guarantee that the devices are running under the corporate policy and in a trusted environment. Enterprise could manage
        assets, install certificates, deploy applications and even lock/wipe devices remotely to prevent data leakage as well.
    </p>
    <p>UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) is a newer term relevant to MDM which has a broader definition for managed devices. Following we use MDM to represent similar products!</p>
    <h2 id="Our-target">
        <a href="#Our-target" title="Our-target"><i></i></a>Our target
    </h2>
    <p>
        MDM, as a centralized system, can manage and control all employees’ devices. It is undoubtedly an ideal asset assessment system for a growing company. Besides, MDM must be reachable publicly to synchronize devices all over the
        world. A centralized and public-exposing appliance, what could be more appealing to hackers?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we have seen hackers and APT groups abusing MDM these years! Such as phishing victims to make MDM a C&amp;C server of their mobile devices, or even compromising the corporate exposed MDM server to push malicious Trojans
        to all devices. You can read the report <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/malicious-mdm-lets-hide-this-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malicious MDM: Let’s Hide This App</a> by Cisco Talos team and
        <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/mobile-as-attack-vector-using-mdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First seen in the wild - Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector</a> by CheckPoint CPR team for more details!
    </p>
    <p>
        From previous cases, we know that MDM is a solid target for hackers, and we would like to do research on it. There are several MDM solutions, even famous companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Apple have their own MDM solution. Which
        one should we start with?
    </p>
    <p>We have listed known MDM solutions and scanned corresponding patterns all over the Internet. We found that the most prevalent MDMs are VMware AirWatch and MobileIron!</p>
    <p>
        So, why did we choose MobileIron as our target? According to their official website, more than 20,000 enterprises chose MobileIron as their MDM solution, and most of our customers are using that as well. We also know Facebook has
        exposed the MobileIron server <a href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. We have analyzed Fortune Global 500 as well,
        and found more than 15% using and exposing their MobileIron server to the public! Due to above reasons, it became our main target!
    </p>
    <h2 id="Where-to-Start">
        <a href="#Where-to-Start" title="Where-to-Start"><i></i></a>Where to Start
    </h2>
    <p>
        From <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13968/Mobileiron.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">past vulnerabilities</a>, we learned there aren’t too many researchers diving into MobileIron. Perhaps the
        attack vector is still unknown. But we suspect the main reason is that the firmware is too hard to obtain. When researching an appliance, turning a pure BlackBox testing into GrayBox, or WhiteBox testing is vital. We spent lots of
        time searching for all kinds of information on the Internet, and ended up with an RPM package. This RPM file is supposed to be the developer’s testing package. The file is just sitting on a listable WebRoot and indexed by Google
        Search.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2002/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"><img data-original-height="1127" data-original-width="2002" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"></a></p><p>Anyway, we got a file to research. The released date of the file is in early 2018. It seems a little bit old but still better than nothing!</p>
    <p><em>P.S. We have informed MobileIron and the sensitive files has been removed now.</em></p>
    <h2 id="Finding-Vulnerabilities">
        <a href="#Finding-Vulnerabilities" title="Finding-Vulnerabilities"><i></i></a>Finding Vulnerabilities
    </h2>
    <p>After a painful time solving the dependency hell, we set the testing package up finally. The component is based on Java and exposed three ports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>443 - the user enrollment interface</li>
        <li>8443 - the appliance management interface</li>
        <li>9997 - the MobileIron device synchronization protocol (MI Protocol)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All opened ports are TLS-encrypted. Apache is in the front of the web part and proxies all connections to backend, a Tomcat with Spring MVC inside.</p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s2048/2020-09-06_230414.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/2020-09-06_230414.png"></a></p><p>Due to the Spring MVC, it’s hard to find traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS from a single view. Therefore, examining the logic and architecture is our goal this time!</p>
    <p>
        Talking about the vulnerability, the root cause is straightforward. Tomcat exposed a Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. However, this doesn’t mean we can do everything! The main effort of this article is
        to solve that, so please see the exploitation below.
    </p>
    <p>Although we know the Web Service deserializes the user input, we can not trigger it. The endpoint is located on both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User enrollment interface - <code>https://mobileiron/mifs/services/</code></li>
        <li>Management interface - <code>https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We can only touch the deserialization through the management interface because the user interface blocks the Web Service access. It’s a critical hit for us because most enterprises won’t expose their management interface to the
        Internet, and a management-only vulnerability is not useful to us so that we have to try harder. :(
    </p>
    <p>Scrutinizing the architecture, we found Apache blocks our access through Rewrite Rules. It looks good, right?</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://<span>%{SERVER_NAME}</span>:8443/mifs/services/<span>$1</span><span> [R=307,L]</span>
<span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services<span> [F]</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>MobileIron relied on Apache Rewrite Rules to block all the access to Web Service. It’s in the front of a reverse-proxy architecture, and the backend is a Java-based web server.</p>
    <p>Have you recalled something?</p>
    
    <p>
        Yes, the <a href="https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Parser Logic</a>! It’s the reverse proxy attack surface I
        <a href="https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#blackbox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed in 2015</a>, and presented at
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/briefings.html#breaking-parser-logic-take-your-path-normalization-off-and-pop-0days-out" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Black Hat USA 2018</a>. This technique leverage the inconsistency
        between the Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and reaccess the Web Service. BTW, this excellent technique is also applied to the recently
        <a href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K52145254" rel="noopener" target="_blank">F5 BIG-IP TMUI RCE vulnerability</a>!</p>

    </h2>
    <p>OK, now we have access to the deserialization wherever it’s on enrollment interface or management interface. Let’s go back to exploitations!</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moritz Bechler</a> has an awesome research which summarized the Hessian deserialization vulnerability on his whitepaper,
        <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Java Unmarshaller Security</a>. From the
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marshalsec</a> source code, we learn the Hessian deserialization triggers the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashcode()</code> while reconstructing a
        <code>HashMap</code>. It could also trigger the <code>toString()</code> through the <code>XString</code>, and the known exploit gadgets so far are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache XBean</li>
        <li>Caucho Resin</li>
        <li>Spring AOP</li>
        <li>ROME EqualsBean/ToStringBean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our environment, we could only trigger the Spring AOP gadget chain and get a JNDI Injection.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Effect</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Apache XBean</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Caucho Resin</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>√</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Spring AOP</strong></td>
                <td><strong>JNDI Injection</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>ROME EqualsBean</td>
                <td>RCE</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Once we have a JNDI Injection, the rest parts of exploitations are easy! We can just leverage <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a>’s work,

        Black Hat USA 2016 to get the code execution… Is that true?
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q8Id1BEFXmQ/X1twcKOk3sI/AAAAAAAAEoc/CB4R9pn0gh4oXhPWvRw040yNtct1NFEywCPcBGAYYCw/s1818/fefewfe.png"><img data-original-height="663" data-original-width="1818" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q8Id1BEFXmQ/X1twcKOk3sI/AAAAAAAAEoc/CB4R9pn0gh4oXhPWvRw040yNtct1NFEywCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/fefewfe.png"></a></p>
    <p>
        Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a> introduced this on Black Hat, we could
        say that this technique helps countless security researchers and brings Java deserialization vulnerability into a new era. However, Java finally mitigated the last JNDI/LDAP puzzle in
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u181-relnotes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2018</a>. After that, all java version higher than 8u181, 7u191, and 6u201 can no longer get code execution through
        JNDI remote URL-Class loading. Therefore, if we exploit the Hessian deserialization on the latest MobileIron, we must face this problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Java changed the default value of <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase</code> to <code>False</code> to prevent attackers from downloading remote URL-Class to get code executions. But only this has been prohibited. We can
        still manipulate the JNDI and redirect the Naming Reference to a local Java Class!
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept is a little bit similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return-Oriented Programming</a>, utilizing a local existing Java Class to do further
        exploitations. You can refer to the article <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java</a> by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/artsploit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Stepankin</a> in early 2019 for details. It describes the attack on POST-JNDI exploitations and how to abuse the Tomcat’s <code>BeanFactory</code> to
        populate the <code>ELProcessor</code> gadget to get code execution. Based on this concept, researcher <a href="https://github.com/welk1n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welkin</a> also provides another <code>ParseClass</code> gadget
        on Groovy. As described in <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/Welk1n/p/11066397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his (Chinese) article</a>:

It’s about WHAT I WANT or even better WHAT I DON’T WANT.&nbsp;</p><p>So what are those things?</p><p>I wouldn’t like to get a job because it doesn’t go with my personality of self-starting projects and initiatives to help people and work on hard and challenging problems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Sure, but what are the important problems? Or better yet, what would your ideal life look like? Why and how do you want to help others?”</p><p>Tough question to answer, but what I do want is a life where I work on things I’d do for free and learn things I’m interested in while focusing on my comparative advantage to solve hard and important problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Why help others?</p><p>My thinking aligns with what Muhammad Ali said, “Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.” Beyond this, it gives me fulfillment and a sense of purpose like nothing else. It makes me think of myself less and imagine the possibilities of the person or people one just helped.&nbsp;</p><p>How about college? Is it even necessary?</p><p>A bad question will give you a bad answer, so let’s ask a better question.&nbsp;</p><p><br>What are the problems I want to work on? What are the technologies that will most likely affect civilization in the next 10-20-50-100 years?&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know what problems per se, but I want to work on important problems and things I’m weirdly interested in while using my comparative advantage. Does having an engineering degree help for what I’m trying to do? I want to be a technologist. Is an engineering degree a must? No, but will it help? Yes, especially having a more technical background.&nbsp;</p><p>How can I work on the “important problems”?</p><p>Well, a good way to carry that out seems with startups because 1) it’s one way where one gets the most leverage, and 2) it’s a model where most incentives are aligned. Nonprofit or other models are not there yet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In a world where many people want to create a startup, the first principles approach, or perhaps the contrarian approach, is not to start one but to understand one’s motivations, why a startup makes sense, or why it doesn’t.</strong></p><p>In lots of colleges, starting to start a startup is like joining a school club or a frat. It’s what you’re supposed to do. Wait, what? I don’t know if that is a good thing or bad thing, but I do know doing something because other people are doing it is the path to misery and competition [2].</p><p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about who I am, what I <strong>really</strong> want, and how I’ll get there.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting there while avoiding competition and being true to myself is what thinking from first principles looks like, and not necessarily by doing the opposite (not creating startups).&nbsp;</p><p>That seems like the right answer, but maybe it’s wrong. Let’s test my initial hypothesis, which is “The most successful startups weren’t trying to be created but found and solved a problem people cared about.&nbsp;</p><p>How can I test this? Can I test it across time? Across countries? How about the biggest companies?</p><p>The biggest companies are partly true, but my hypothesis falls apart. For instance, take Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Stripe, or Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>My hypothesis isn’t supported because the founders (mostly) were actively trying to start something to achieve X. They wanted to start a startup and were successful at finding a problem, solution, or service that people cared, liked, and enjoyed. They made people’s lives easier, cheaper, and more convenient.</p><p>This reminds me of the advice on how to create billion-dollar startups by one of the most successful founders of our time, Evan Williams, who co-founded Twitter, Blogger, Medium, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>He said that most successful startups do one of these three things:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Find a human desire</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>People want to do the same thing as others and have the same desires</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Make something convenient&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Fast</p></li><li><p>Make people not think</p></li><li><p>Make people more productive</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Take a boring experience and make them exciting.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Examples</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Gyms: Equinox</p></li><li><p>Coffee: Starbucks</p></li><li><p>Airlines: Virgin Atlantic</p></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>To start a successful startup, you have to want it and you have to be intentional about it. Collison (Stripe) was always working on projects ideas during college until Stripe gained traction and he dropped out. Bezos (Amazon) realized the opportunities of the internet, so he quit his high-paying job in Wall St, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as creating startups is what people are supposed to do, now more than ever, we need to think about why a startup, why it makes and doesn’t make sense, and avoid mindlessness at all costs, just because everyone seems to be starting a startup does not mean you should.&nbsp;</p><p>If I want to start a startup. How do I do it? By following the framework above, having <strong>some </strong>skills, and <strong>crazy wild belief </strong>you can do it.&nbsp;</p><p>So why do we do what we do? We imitate others, we follow prestige, and do what people think it’s cool.&nbsp;</p><p>But no!!!! If you want to have a life of greatness and excellence, you take a step back and try to think from <a href="https://www.techtello.com/first-principles-thinking/" target="_blank">first principles.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Few people stop to think and see for themselves. And ask, “Am I being authentic to my true self, or am I just being a copycat?”</p><p>Wait. Hold on a second.</p><p>I already started a startup. Instead of being a company, the startup is me. I’m young, seeking opportunities and big returns. Exactly like a startup.&nbsp;</p><div><p>The startup of me might start a company, or it might not. We’ll have to see. If you’d like to get updates every week, consider signing to my <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter">Weekly Memos.&nbsp;</a></p></div><p><strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>[1] Many college students want an internship; this is not that weird of a coincidence. But again, why do we even get internships? Is it because that’s the way things are or because it makes sense? Something to think about.&nbsp;</p><p>[2] "Doing something because other people are doing it is the path to misery and competition." I’m referring to business and startups. This does not really apply to health, relationships, workout, etc.<br></p><p>Thanks to <a href="http://camhouser.com/" target="_blank">Cam</a>, <a href="https://adamtank.com/" target="_blank">Adam</a>, and <a href="https://najla.cc/" target="_blank">Najla</a> for reading drafts of this essay.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599934763715_8910"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), sign up for my <a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/newsletter"><em>Weekly Memos</em></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out.

			<h5>A Universal life-long self charging green battery</h5>

		</p>
	</div><div>
		<div>
			<h4>NDB incorporates state of the art technology in its systems. Some of the key concepts are:</h4>

<p><strong>Diamond Nuclear Voltaic (DNV):</strong> NDB is one of the earliest adopters and developers of this technology backed up by recent publications. Typically, DNV as a device is a combination of a semiconductor, metal and ceramic which has two contact surfaces to facilitate charge collection. Several single units are attached together to create a stack arrangement, which is fabricated to create a positive and negative contact surface similar to a common battery system. Every layer of the DNV stack consists of a high energy output source. This kind of arrangement improves the overall efficiency of the system and provides a multi layer safety shield for the product.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid conversion from radiation to electricity:</strong> All radioisotopes are known to produce high amounts of heat. The strategic placement of the source between the DNV units facilitates inelastic scattering originated due to the presence of single crystalline diamond (SCD) in the DNV unit. This design prevents self-absorption of heat by the radioisotope and enables rapid conversion to usable electricity.</p>

<p><strong>Thin film structure:&nbsp;</strong>The thin-film profile exhibited by NDB allows radiation absorption in the single crystalline diamond with minimal self adsorption. Due to its flexible design structure, this technology can take any shape and form in accordance to the application. This makes NDB’s battery system market friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear recycle process:&nbsp;</strong>Utilization of radioactive waste as otherwise is a subject not many have looked into. At NDB, we aim to &nbsp;reuse the nuclear fuel by reprocessing and recycling to enable sustainability and promote a clean energy source in a safe and secure environment.</p>


<h2>Safety</h2>

<h4>One of the key innovations of NDB is its highly sophisticated safety feature covering the three most important aspects of thermal, mechanical and radiation safety. The battery system uses several concepts to ensure maximum safety of the device:</h4>

<p><strong>Diamond encapsulator:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The DNV stacks along with the source are coated with a layer of poly-crystalline diamond, which is known for being the most thermally conductive material also has the ability to contain the radiation within the device and is the hardest material, twelve times tougher than stainless steel. This makes our product extremely tough and tamperproof.</p>

<p><strong>Built in thermal vents:</strong> The high energy source present in the battery system produces heat during operation. This leads to thermal conduction in the system. Thermal vents in the system help conduct this process with respect to the outer surface of the diamond to keep the interiors at an optimum level.</p>

<p><strong>Boron-doped SCD:</strong> Trying to utilise every aspect in the system, NDB in addition to alpha and beta also incorporates usage of neutron radiations by utilising a boron-10 doping. Doping helps to convert the extra neutron into alpha ray.</p>

<p><strong>Lock-in System:</strong> Using a nuclear power source for a battery system brings up the question of nuclear proliferation due to production of fissionable isotopes such as Pu- 238 and U-232. To tackle this issue, NDB uses an ion implantation mechanism called “lock-in system” which prevents usage other than power generation. This increases the usability, by meeting consumer safety requirements.</p>

<span><a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/index.html">Home</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/index.html">Articles</a> &gt; new codebase, who dis? (How to Join a Team and Learn a Codebase)</span>

<p>I have switched teams more often than I have had to implement an AVL tree, and you can guess which one of those two was taught in school. I wish someone had taught me how to join a new team! While learning a new codebase can be daunting, I've found a few things that work for me.</p>
<p>You should do at least three things when joining a new team. The order of these three can be whatever you like, but all three should be done as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you’ll likely set up the development environment. As you do this, pay attention to just what it is that you're setting up. For instance, if you need to get Redis running locally, then that's a good hint that there's some caching happening somewhere. Noting the order in which you run internal projects helps you understand dependencies. If the feature store needs to be running before you bring up the model serving service, that's a hint that the model serving service may depend upon the feature store. Such dependencies start to hint at the overall architecture.</p>
<p>Take notes on the exact commands you’re running and packages you’re installing. You’re bound to run into something that’s changed since the setup docs were written, and being able to correct them is a quick win you can provide to the new team. Plus, it's good to know exactly how you ruined your system installation of Python.</p>
<p>Ideally, the code you're working on should have some sort of automated test suite in place. A good way to start experimenting with and understanding the code is to get that test suite successfully running, then make changes to the codebase completely at random and see what breaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> thing you should do is get some overview of the architecture. Some teams will have a document describing this, and if that document is an accurate depiction of reality then you should certainly work to understand it. In any case, asking a more senior person on the team to give you an overview is a good idea. They should know how up-to-date that document is (if it does exist) and also be able to describe and/or draw the architecture for you. Here are some sample questions you can consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What repositories (or portions of repositories) do we own and/or work on most frequently? What do each of them do?</li>
<li>Where does our code run? (e.g. EC2 Instances, Google's Kubernetes Engine, on prem)</li>
<li>What does the deployment pipeline look like? How does a feature get from my laptop to live in production?</li>
<li>Do we have certain services, packages, classes, or files that are a real headache? Areas that are particularly unreliable or error-prone?</li>
<li>Are there external API's, vendors, or products that we use or rely on? (e.g. SendGrid, DataDog, MySQL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to environment setup, an easy thing you can do to help the team is to document that architectural overview (or update the existing document). Write down what you learned, take a picture of the diagrams that were drawn, and post that information somewhere visible to the team. Be sure to put an "as of" date on your changes. Even stable projects exhibit some change over a long enough time period, so this date will help future readers know if they can trust this document.</p>
<p>A <strong>third</strong> thing you should do when starting on a new team is start understanding the business. If you're new to the company, figure out its mission, product offering(s), and goal(s). Then work to understand how your team fits into those things. Some sample questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can our team make an impact on the company's goals?</li>
<li>If our code were to break horrifically, who would get angry? How fast would that happen?</li>
<li>What other teams do we have the most interaction with? What services/codebases do they own? Do we share parts of our codebase with other teams?</li>
</ul>
<p>Without an understanding of the team's place in the company, you're doomed. You won't have sufficient context to execute your work well.</p>
<h2>Mindset</h2>
<p>I strongly believe that learning a new codebase happens best through implementing real features (even if they are small to start with). The whole point of being on this team as an individual contributor is to build stuff, and there is no better way to learn how to do something than by spending quality time doing that exact thing. As you build skill and understanding, you can work on larger and larger projects over time.</p>
<p>Implementing something will require you to read the code. But "read" may be a misleading word here, because reading code is dramatically different from reading a novel. Code is typically organized with more related code being closer together (in the same directory, package, class, or file). Can you imagine a novel written in this way? If Tolkien had placed all scenes of two characters fighting each other in adjacent pages, while all scenes with magic in them occurred in a separate book? How absurd!</p>
<p>Though learning to code taught me the basics of reading code, nobody ever taught me how to read a large codebase. To do so, we must adopt a certain mindset. Balance understanding each intricate detail against making impact quickly. Quick impact helps establish your reputation on the team and gets you to that accurate/intricate understanding faster than trying to read everything up front.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb I use is to understand something just enough to express what it does without necessarily knowing exactly how it does that. This process is called "chunking," and it relies on the fact that once you have a basic understanding of a unit of code, "you don't need to remember all the little underlying details" (Oakley). If you're worried about not understanding everything in minute detail, don't be afraid to take a note to come back and understand that chunk more fully.</p>
<p>This understanding will grow recursively: first, you understand what the various services do. Then, you identify the particular service you need to modify and start to understand the various modules within that service. In the modules you modify, you'll start to understand the classes contained. The base case of this recursive process is the individual line.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that different teams may implement the same concept or pattern in different ways. Understanding why your current team chose the way they did is another way new teammates can help the team. It's totally possible that your new team hasn't heard of the cool way to implement singletons that you like. It's equally possible that your way is worse in some way you didn't know. Either way, someone gets to learn something!</p>
<p>The last mindset recommendation I'll give before we dive into the process is to try to understand the code both in terms of code paths and data flows. Think about which objects know what information and how that information flows between parts of the system.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I recommend this process for working in any codebase:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Locate the portion of code most relevant to the immediate task</strong> at hand.</li>
<li>Understand that code enough to <strong>form a hypothesis</strong> about the change you need to make.</li>
<li>Make that change and <strong>test your hypothesis</strong>. Sometimes the best way will be to click around in the UI or run a particular script. Sometimes the easiest path is to write a test that describes the behavior you're after.</li>
<li>If your hypothesis was incorrect, return to step 2. Understand why that change didn't do what you thought it would, and develop a new hypothesis.</li>
<li>Once you have working code, <strong>improve its quality</strong>. Write a test (or a few) that document the changes in behavior you made. Refactor your code for clarity and style.</li>
</ol>
<p>This scientific approach guides us gradually toward correct, high quality code without having to understand each and every bit of code around our change.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>While you could certainly get by with just a text editor and some patience, a wide variety of tools exist that help us read code more effectively throughout the process identified above.</p>
<h3>Identifying relevant code</h3>
<p>While step one gets easier over time as we build familiarity with some portion of code, we often begin step one completely lost. A few approaches are helpful here: running the code, project search, and code search.</p>
<p>Running the code helps you understand it. Before you start changing things, understand what already exists. This could mean reproducing a bug locally, finding the place in the UI where the new feature will go, or any number of other things. When you do, stepping through the execution in a debugger will give you a strong start on understanding what is going on.</p>
<p>By "project search," I mean searching artifacts created as part of the software development lifecycle. Particularly useful are issue trackers like JIRA/Asana/Pivotal Tracker, pull requests and issues in tools like GitHub and GitLab, and the git history itself. Because few tasks are truly novel, we can often gain understanding by looking for similar past work. Try several different keywords. Sometimes you'll find a pull request that implements something very similar to what you want to do, and you can use that as a guide. Trying to divine something from scratch, while sometimes necessary, requires significantly more effort than adapting from an example.</p>
<p>Code search is just what it sounds like. For code that you have checked out locally, I highly recommend using a tool specifically built for recursive search like ack, Silver Searcher (ag), or ripgrep. But you won't always have every bit of code at the company checked out locally, and sometimes it's useful to be able to search exhaustively. For this use case, tools like OpenGrok or Sourcegraph are super helpful. GitHub and GitLab also offer ways to search all code within a specific organization.</p>
<p>No matter which tool you're using, try several keywords you think might be relevant. Consider changing case sensitivity. You may have better results filtering down to specific file types.</p>
<h3>Understanding code</h3>
<p>Using these various search tools, we arrive at a set of relevant locations. Thus, we arrive into step two of our process: …</p></div>

<p><span>Fraud has a direct impact on Uber as well as user experiences on the platform. To combat bad actors, &nbsp;Uber has a dedicated team of anti-fraud analysts, data scientists, and UX experts who work collaboratively on this issue. As part of this effort, we build internal services that help us continually monitor and respond to changes in the ever-evolving fraud landscape. </span></p>
<p><span>These services look for errant behaviors, actions that would not have been taken by legitimate users. Using our fraud fighting technologies, we can, for instance, differentiate between actual trips and those created by GPS spoofing, or analyze how our apps are being used to reveal fraudsters. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we detail some types of fraud and the technologies we use to counter them.</span></p>
<h3><span>Types of fraud</span></h3>
<p><span>At Uber, we deal with multiple types of fraud, such as payment fraud, incentive abuse, and compromised accounts. We outline these categories, below:</span></p>

<h4><span>Payment fraud</span></h4>
<p><span>Payment fraud happens when bad actors use stolen credit cards to pay for Uber trips. Typically, when credit card owners discover unauthorized transactions on their accounts, they call the bank or credit card company to dispute it, and Uber refunds the charge. In order to maximize the profit from stolen credit cards, fraudsters don’t take these trips themselves. Instead, working as an agent service, they advertise discounted trip services on websites and chat forums to other people.</span></p>
<h4>Incentive abuse</h4>
<p><span>Uber frequently offers new users a credit for signing up or referring friends, as well as bonuses for drivers who complete a certain amount of trips within a given time period. Fraudsters try to take advantage of these incentives by creating fake accounts to earn new user and referral credits or simulating fake trips to earn a driver bonus. </span></p>

<h4><span>Compromised accounts</span></h4>
<p><span>Fraudsters also use </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>phishing techniques</span></a><span> to access rider and driver accounts. With a rider account, a fraudster can offer agent services, selling rides to other people. Access to a driver account might let a fraudster withdraw money. Phishing techniques usually include emails, text messages, or phone calls to trick users into giving up their passwords and two-factor authentication codes. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3348"><a href="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_03-300x164.jpg" alt="Fraudulent text message" width="300" height="164" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_03-300x164.jpg 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_03.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3348">Figure 3: A scam message with a link to a fake payment site asks for a rider’s banking details.</figcaption></figure>

<h3><span>Detection systems</span></h3>
<p><span>Fraud fighting at scale is a challenging task. We are not fighting against a small number of individuals, but large, well-organized criminal communities equipped with advanced technologies and excellent customer service. However, we have developed even more advanced technologies to help combat this problem.</span></p>
<h4><span>GPS spoofing detection </span></h4>
<p><span>We have seen bad actors use GPS spoofing apps to create fake locations on a phone in order to simulate a real trip in the hopes of getting paid through a driver account. The standard technique involves a fraudster creating a new rider account, adding a stolen credit card, and using that account to pay for a spoofed/fake trip from their driver account. The credit card is cashed out and payment goes to the fraudulent driver account. Sometimes fraudsters create multiple spoofed/fake trips to boost the total number of trips, so they can earn an incentive bonus from Uber. What they don’t know is that we can detect GPS spoofing and block these fraudulent payments.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3350"><a href="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05-300x115.png" alt="Altitude distribution graph" width="600" height="229" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05-300x115.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05-768x293.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05-1024x391.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_05.png 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3350">Figure 5: Altitude distribution of trips in a city with a high degree of fraudulent behavior.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>To this end, we developed an altitude profile for all the geographic locations around the world by aggregating historical trip data. We then compare each trip’s altitude with the profile altitude. In this example, show below in Figure 6, you can easily see that a real trip’s altitude aligns closely with the earth’s surface, while the fake trips are flying in the sky or traveling underground. </span></p>

<figure id="attachment_3352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3352"><a href="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_06-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_06-2.png" alt="Altitude Distribution visualization labels" width="466" height="41" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_06-2.png 466w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_06-2-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3352">Figure 6: Real trips on Uber follow the geographical altitude of a city or region, while spoofed trips look like they are flying through the air or tunneling underground.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>We used a similar computation for speed matching, shown below in Figure 7, with hourly speed profiles for global road segments on each day of the week. By comparing a trip’s speed to the speed profile, we can see what percentage of a trip travels at an abnormal speed, indicating the likelihood of it being fake. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3353" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3353"><a href="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07.png"><img loading="lazy" src="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07-300x200.png" alt="Comparison of trips versus speed profiles" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07-300x200.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07-768x511.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07-1024x682.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_07.png 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3353">Figure 7: By developing a speed profile for roads in an area, we can see which trips deviate substantially from that profile, likely indicating GPS spoofing.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Location integrity as a defense strategy is a complex task and suffers from limitations in regions with few Uber trips. To bolster our fraud prevention, we identify suspicious regions by corresponding low trip probability with high fraudulent account sign-up rates. Combining these parameters with other signals, such as financial loss, device information, and trip-level or user-level features, we sample trips for manual review. We have a dedicated manual review team responsible for </span><span>labeling trips as legitimate or fraudulent with a high degree of confidence,</span><span> as well as discovering new fraud patterns. Finally, we built a high-precision machine learning model to detect trips created by GPS spoofing. Meanwhile, we can use deep learning models for anomaly detection and reduce the effort of engineering new features. </span></p>

<h4><span>Sequence modeling to classify user behavior </span></h4>
<p><span>Interaction patterns with Uber apps differ between normal users and fraudsters. When requesting a ride, most users follow a sequence of editing the drop-off location, moving the pin around on the map, viewing the prices of different product types, and clicking the trip request button. Fraudsters follow a different pattern optimized for them to make the most money as quickly as possible. These distinct usage patterns let us use </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Long Short Term Memory</span></a><span> (LSTM) deep learning models to differentiate between the two. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3355"><a href="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_09_anim.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="http://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fraud_Figure_09_anim.gif" alt="Animated gif of app usage" width="269" height="480"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3355">Figure 9: Users interact with Uber’s app through different tap sequences. This GIF shows a legitimate user editing the drop off address, clicking different product types, and requesting a trip.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>For example, a good user who is new to Uber typically spends time reviewing the product types, comparing the differences between uberPOOL, uberX, and UberBLACK. However, a fraudster who is offering agent services to other people will spend more time editing addresses, moving pins, and changing payment methods. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>We view the tap-stream data as a time series and use </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>one-hot</span></a><span> encoding to represent each tap. We also append the timestamp to the vector to keep the time duration information. These vectors are the input to our LSTM model. The final activation layer is a probability score that predicts if a sequence of taps is from a bad user or not. The &nbsp;second last layer is a 64-dimensional dense vector that can also be viewed as an encoded feature for the tap stream. </span></p>

<h3><span>Moving forward</span></h3>
<p><span>Fraud fighting is a long-term, continuous effort, since the fraud black market itself is very sophisticated and adapts to new products and new services over time. We need to build systems that maintain a good balance between providing a quick turnaround for fraud detection and offering a robust, stable, and scalable infrastructure. </span></p>

        <p><span>At Uber, real-time analytics allow us to attain business insights and operational efficiency, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to improve experiences on the Uber platform. For example, our operations team relies on data to monitor the market health and spot potential issues on our platform; software powered by machine learning models leverages data to predict rider supply and driver demand; and data scientists use data to improve machine learning models for better forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span>In the past, we have utilized many third-party database solutions for real-time analytics, but none were able to simultaneously address all of our functional, scalability, performance, cost, and operational requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>Released in November 2018, AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. An emerging tool for real-time analytics, GPU technology has advanced significantly over the years, making it a perfect fit for real-time computation and data processing in parallel. </span></p>
<p><span>In the following sections, we describe the design of AresDB and how this powerful solution for real-time analytics has allowed us to more performatively and efficiently unify, simplify, and improve Uber’s real-time analytics database solutions. After reading this article, we hope you try out AresDB for your own projects and find the tool useful your own analytics needs, too! </span></p>
<h3>Real-time analytics applications at Uber</h3>
<p><span>Data analytics are crucial to the success of Uber’s business. Among other functions, these analytics are used to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Build </span><b>dashboards</b><span> to monitor our business metrics</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>automated decisions</b><span> (such as </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>trip pricing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/advanced-technologies-detecting-preventing-fraud-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fraud detection</span></a><span>) based on aggregated metrics that we collect</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>ad hoc queries</b><span> to diagnose and troubleshoot business operations issues</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We can summarize these functions into categories with different requirements as follows:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Dashboards</b></td>
<td><b>Decision Systems</b></td>
<td><b>Ad hoc Queries</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Pattern</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Arbitrary </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query QPS</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Latency</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Dataset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>All data</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span>Dashboards and decision systems leverage real-time analytical systems to make similar queries over relatively small, yet highly valuable, subsets of data (with maximum data freshness) at high QPS and low latency.</span></p>
<h4>The need for another analytical engine</h4>
<p><span>The most common problem that real-time analytics solves at Uber is how to compute time series aggregates, calculations that give us insight into the user experience so we can improve our services accordingly. With these computations, we can request metrics by specific dimensions (such as day, hour, city ID, and trip status) over a time range on arbitrarily filtered (or sometimes joined) data. Over the years, Uber has deployed multiple solutions to solve this problem in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the third-party solutions we’ve used for solving this type of problem include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Apache Pinot</b></a><span>, an open source distributed analytical database written in Java, can be leveraged for large-scale data analytics. Pinot employs a lambda architecture internally to query batch and real-time data in columnar storage, uses inverted bitmap index for filtering, and relies on star-tree for aggregate result caching. However, it does not support key-based deduplication, upsert, joins, and advanced query features such as geo-spatial-filtering. In addition, being a JVM-based database, query execution on Pinot runs at a higher cost in terms of memory usage.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Elasticsearch</b></a><span> is used at Uber for a variety of streaming analytics needs. It was built on Apache </span><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Lucene</span></a><span> for full-text keyword search that stores documents and inverted index. It has been widely adopted and extended to also support aggregates. The inverted index enables filtering, yet it is not optimized for time range-based storage and filtering. It stores records as JSON documents, imposing additional storage and query access overhead. Like Pinot, Elasticsearch is a JVM-based database, and as such, does not support joins and its query execution runs at a higher memory cost. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While these technologies have strengths of their own, they lacked crucial functionalities for our use case. We needed a unified, simplified, and optimized solution, and thought outside-of-the-box (or rather, inside the GPU) to reach a solution.</span></p>
<h3>Leveraging GPUs for real-time analytics</h3>
<p><span>To render realistic views of images at a high frame rate, GPUs process a massive amount of geometries and pixels in parallel at high speed. While the clock-rate increase for processing units has plateaued over the past few years, the number of transistors on a chip has only increased per </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moore’s law</span></a><span>. As a result, GPU computation speeds, measured in Gigaflops per second (GFLOP/s), are rapidly increasing. Figure 1, below, depicts the theoretical GFLOP/s trend comparing NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs over the years:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5345"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png 1999w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-300x157.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-768x402.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1024x536.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-696x365.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1068x559.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-802x420.png 802w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1920x1006.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5345">Figure 1: Comparison of CPU and GPU single precision floating point performance through the years.

<p><span>When designing our real-time analytics querying engine, integrating GPU processing was a natural fit. At Uber, the typical real-time analytical query processes a few days of data with millions to billions of records and then filters and aggregates them in a short amount of time. This computation task fits perfectly into the parallel processing model of general purpose GPUs because they:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Process data in parallel very quickly. </span></li>
<li><span>Deliver greater computation throughput (GFLOPS/s), making them a good fit for heavy computation tasks (per unit data) that can be parallelized. </span></li>
<li><span>Offer greater compute-to-storage (ALU to GPU global memory) data access throughput (not latency) compared to central processing units (CPUs), making them ideal for processing I/O (memory)-bound parallel tasks that require a massive amount of data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Once we settled on using a GPU-based analytical database, we assessed a few existing analytics solutions that leveraged GPUs for our needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kinetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Kinetica</b></a><span>, a GPU-based analytics engine, was initially marketed towards U.S. military and intelligence applications in 2009. While it demonstrates the great potential of GPU technology in analytics, we found many key features missing</span> <span>for our use case, including </span><span>schema alteration, partial insertion or updates, data compression, column-level memory/disk retention configuration, and join by geospatial relationships.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.omnisci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>OmniSci</b></a><span>, an open source, SQL-based query engine, seemed like a promising option, but as we evaluated the product, we realized that it did not have critical</span><span> features for Uber’s use case, such as deduplication. While </span><span>OminiSci</span> <span>open sourced their project in 2017, after some analysis of their C++-based solution, we concluded that neither contributing back nor forking their codebase was viable.</span></li>
<li><span>GPU-based real-time analytics engines, including </span><a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/gpuqp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUQP</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://cogadb.dfki.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CoGaDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p817-yuan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p709-heimel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ocelot</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1374-he.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OmniDB</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://github.com/bakks/virginian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Virginian</span></a><span>, are frequently used by academic institutions. However, given their academic purpose, these solutions focus on developing algorithms and designing proof of concepts as opposed to handling real-world production scenarios. For this reason, we discounted them for our scope and scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, </span><span>these engines</span><span> demonstrate the great advantage and potential of data processing using GPU technology, and they inspired us to build our own GPU-based, real-time analytics solution tailored to Uber’s needs. With these concepts in mind, we built and open sourced AresDB.</span></p>
<h3>AresDB architecture overview</h3>
<p><span>At a high level, AresDB stores most of its data in host memory (RAM that is connected to CPUs), handling data ingestion using CPUs and data recovery via disks. At query time, AresDB transfers data from host memory to GPU memory for parallel processing on GPU. As shown in Figure 2, below, AresDB consists of a memory store, a meta datastore, and a disk store:</span></p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p><span>Unlike most </span><span>relational database management systems (</span><span>RDBMSs), there is no database or schema scope in AresDB. All tables belong to the same scope in the same AresDB cluster/instance, enabling users to refer to them directly. Users store their data as fact tables and dimension tables.</span></p>
<h5>Fact table</h5>
<p><span>A fact table stores an infinite stream of time series events. Users use a fact table to store events/facts that are happening in real time, and each event is associated with an event time, with the table often queried by the event time. An example of the type of information stored by fact tables are trips, where each trip is an event and the trip request time is often designated as the event time. In case an event has multiple timestamps associated with it, only one timestamp is designated as the time of the event displayed in the fact table.</span></p>
<h5>Dimension table</h5>
<p><span>A dimension table stores current properties for entities (including cities, clients, and drivers). For example, users can store city information, such as city name, time zone, and country, in a dimension table. Compared to fact tables, which grow infinitely over time, dimension tables are always bounded by size (e.g., for Uber, the cities table is bounded by the actual number of cities in the world). Dimension tables do not need a special time column.</span></p>
<h4>Data types</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600010628912/wTYNJ5bF3.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="meet-uxcel">Meet Uxcel</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I stumbled upon <a target="_blank" href="https://uxcel.com/?ref=nikolovlazar.com">Uxcel</a>, an app that teaches you UX/UI. It looked really clean, so I decided to give it a go. The app has a <strong>Course</strong>, <strong>Lesson of the Week</strong>, and a <strong>UEye Training</strong> sections.</p>
<p>First I finished the UX/UI Design Foundation course. It has 6 levels which covers pretty much everything, like Color Theory, UI Design Principles, Typography, Iconography, Terminologies, Animations etc... The app's teaching method is fun. It shows you either 2 different images and you need to select the correct one, or 1 image with multiple answers. After you pick/answer it shows you the correct answer and a brief explanation.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600011317011/sbjpDJUin.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screenshots of the app"></p>
<p>When I finished all 6 levels it generated a nice <a target="_blank" href="https://certificates.uxcel.com/DP1AFJPVJJHL">certificate</a> for me, which felt good and I shared it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>After finishing the course, I started playing around with the UEye Training. I can't tell you how <strong>addicting</strong> and fun this is! It works similarly to the course, you're presented with 2 pictures, one of them has a UI mistake, the other one is correct. You have 20 seconds to identify the correct one. When you pick the correct one it gives you points. You can <strong>really</strong> benefit from this if you regularly do the UEye Training. They also have a configurable Reminder, which is a cool feature.</p>
<p>Since finding out about it, I've never missed a day without doing some UEye Training. They've recently added some new designs and it was so fun noticing the little mistakes. The points system and leaderboard brings more motivation to keep practicing.</p>
<h2 id="pro-tip">Pro tip:</h2>
<p>Uxcel is a PWA, a Progressive Web App. This means that you can install it on your Home screen on your smartphone. Here's how to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>On iOS: Open <a target="_blank" href="https://app.uxcel.com/learn?ref=nikolovlazar.com">app.uxcel.com/learn</a> in Safari, click on the Share button (the one in the middle), and scroll down. You should see a "Add to Home Screen" option.</li>
<li>On Android: Open <a target="_blank" href="https://app.uxcel.com/learn?ref=nikolovlazar.com">app.uxcel.com/learn</a> in Chrome and you should see a banner on the bottom saying "Add to home screen".</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to install it on your smartphone, so you can practice anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Also, They regularly update their UX/UI Design Foundations course, so even if you complete it, click on the "Review Course" to see if they've added something new.</p>
<h2 id="lets-practice-together">Let's practice together</h2>
<p>Whether you're a developer or designer, Uxcel is one of the tools that can help you become good at UX/UI Designing. Keep practicing and you'll start to see progress. So, <a target="_blank" href="https://uxcel.com/?invite=9DUE0MRLSJTU">join me</a> and let's practice together.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org2fd690a">
<p>
The original motivation for adding <code>Record</code> to <code>x7</code> is the ability to open, read, and write to files.
We'll back the <code>x7</code> File implementation by the <code>rust</code> File struct, so let's make a new file in <code>x7</code> - <code>records/file.rs</code>:
</p>
<p>
We will start by making a <code>FileRecord</code> struct:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>derive</span><span>(</span><span>Clone, Debug</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>
<span>pub</span><span>(</span><span>crate</span><span>)</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FileRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span>: <span>String</span>,
    <span>// </span><span>The Record trait requires Sync + Send</span>
    <span>file</span>: <span>Arc</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Mutex</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span>::<span>fs</span>::<span>File</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span>,
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The type <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;std::fs::File&gt;&gt;</code> is necessary as <code>x7</code> requires all types to be thread safe.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have a struct, let's expose a way to generate one from <code>x7</code>. We want the following <code>x7</code> expression to work:
</p>

<p>
This will map to a <code>Expr::String("file-name")</code> in the interpreter, so we need two methods:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A way to open files given a <code>String</code></li>
<li>A way to open files given an <code>Expr::String</code></li>
</ol>
<p>
With that in mind, here's the two relevant methods:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>FileRecord</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>/// Open a file with the given Path</span>
      <span>pub</span><span>(</span><span>crate</span><span>)</span> <span>fn</span> <span>open_file</span><span>(</span><span>path</span>: <span>String</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// </span><span>Open the file with liberal permissions.</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>f</span> = <span>OpenOptions</span>::new<span>()</span>
          .write<span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
          .create<span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
          .read<span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
          .open<span>(</span>path.clone<span>()</span><span>)</span>
          .map_err<span>(</span>|e| <span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not open file \"{}\" because {}"</span>, &amp;path, e<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>?</span>;
      <span>// </span><span>Make the path pretty.</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>abs_path</span> = <span>fs</span>::canonicalize<span>(</span>path<span>)</span>
          .map_err<span>(</span>|e| <span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not canonicalize path! {}"</span>, e<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>?</span>
          .to_str<span>()</span>
          .ok_or_else<span>(</span>|| <span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not represent path as UTF-8 string"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>?</span>
          .into<span>()</span>;
      <span>// </span><span>record! is a macro to assist in making LispResult&lt;Expr::Record&gt; types</span>
      <span>record!</span><span>(</span><span>FileRecord</span>::new<span>(</span>f, abs_path<span>)</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>/// Open a file from x7</span>
  <span>/// This function signature will let us expose it directly to the interpreter</span>
  <span>pub</span><span>(</span><span>crate</span><span>)</span> <span>fn</span> <span>from_x7</span><span>(</span><span>exprs</span>: <span>Vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>_symbol_table</span>: &amp;<span>SymbolTable</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exact_len!</span><span>(</span>exprs, <span>1</span><span>)</span>;
      <span>let</span> <span>path</span> = exprs<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>.get_string<span>()</span><span>?</span>;
      <span>FileRecord</span>::open_file<span>(</span>path<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now that we have the ability to make a <code>FileRecord</code>, we'll need to implement <code>Record</code>
so it can be understood by the interpreter (<code>Expr::Record</code>).
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Record</span> <span>for</span> <span>FileRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>call_method</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span>, <span>sym</span>: &amp;<span>str</span>, <span>args</span>: <span>Vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// </span><span>We have no methods yet.</span>
      <span>unknown_method!</span><span>(</span><span>self</span>, sym<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>type_name</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; &amp;'<span>static</span> <span>str</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"FileRecord"</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>display</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"File&lt;</span><span>{}</span><span>&gt;"</span>, <span>self</span>.path<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>debug</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span>.display<span>()</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>clone</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>RecordType</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Box</span>::new<span>(</span><span>Clone</span>::clone<span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>methods</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span>&amp;'<span>static</span> <span>str</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Vec</span>::new<span>()</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>use</span> <span>std</span>::<span>collections</span>::<span>hash_map</span>::<span>DefaultHasher</span>;
        <span>use</span> <span>std</span>::<span>hash</span>::<span>{</span><span>Hash</span>, <span>Hasher</span><span>}</span>;
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>h</span> = <span>DefaultHasher</span>::new<span>()</span>;
        <span>self</span>.path.hash<span>(</span>&amp;<span>mut</span> h<span>)</span>;
        h.finish<span>()</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We also need to expose <code>FileRecord::from_x7</code> to the interpreter, so let's head back and add it to <code>make_stdlib_fns</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre> <span>make_stdlib_fns!</span><span>{</span>
  <span>// </span><span>elided functions...</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"call_method"</span>, <span>2</span>, call_method, <span>true</span>, <span>"&lt;doc-string&gt;"</span><span>)</span>,
  <span>// </span><span>Open a file</span>
  <span>(</span><span>"fs::open"</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>FileRecord</span>::from_x7, <span>true</span>, <span>"Open a file."</span><span>)</span>,
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We can now compile and run <code>x7</code> to see what happens:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>def f <span>(</span>fs::open <span>"hello-world.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
nil
&gt;&gt;&gt; f
File&lt;/home/david/programming/x7/hello-world.txt&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Nice! We've opened a file. We can now implement some other useful methods on <code>FileRecord</code> like reading from a file:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>FileRecord</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/// Read the contents of a file to a String,</span>
  <span>/// rewinding the cursor to the front.</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>read_all</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>buf</span> = <span>String</span>::new<span>()</span>;
      <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>guard</span> = <span>self</span>.file.lock<span>()</span>;
      guard
          .read_to_string<span>(</span>&amp;<span>mut</span> buf<span>)</span>
          .map_err<span>(</span>|e| <span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"Failed to read to string {}"</span>, e<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>?</span>;
      <span>rewind_file!</span><span>(</span>guard<span>)</span>;
      <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>buf<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>/// Read the contents of a FileRecord to a string.</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span>, <span>args</span>: <span>Vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>// </span><span>We want no arguments.</span>
      <span>exact_len!</span><span>(</span>args, <span>0</span><span>)</span>;
      <span>self</span>.read_all<span>()</span>.map<span>(</span><span>Expr</span>::<span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We can update our <code>Record</code> implementation for <code>FileRecord</code> to include this method:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>impl</span> <span>Record</span> <span>for</span> <span>FileRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>call_method</span><span>(</span>&amp;<span>self</span>, <span>sym</span>: &amp;<span>str</span>, <span>args</span>: <span>Vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> -&gt; <span>LispResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Expr</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>match</span> sym <span>{</span>
            <span>"read_to_string"</span> =&gt; <span>self</span>.read_to_string<span>(</span>args<span>)</span>,
            _ =&gt; <span>unknown_method!</span><span>(</span><span>self</span>, sym<span>)</span>,
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And use it:
</p>
<div>
<pre>~ echo <span>"hello"</span> &gt; hello-world.txt
~ x7
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>def f <span>(</span>fs::open <span>"hello-world.txt"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>call_method f <span>"read_to_string"</span><span>)</span>
<span>"hello"</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Awesome! We're able to call methods on <code>FileRecord</code>. It's the same process to implement <code>.write</code> and other useful file operations, so we'll elide it. This is great stuff, and would be even better with some syntactic sugar.
</p>
<p>
Let's add method call syntax so these two expressions are equal:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>call_method f <span>"read_to_string"</span><span>)</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>(</span>.read_to_string f<span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong.</p>



<p>The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Don’t Make Me Think</a> thesis.</p>



<p><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, the seminal web usability book by Steve Krug, tells us that products should be as simple as possible for users to use. Products shouldn’t be self-explanatory (ie understandable given a set of instructions), they should be self-evident (ie so obvious that they can be used <em>without</em> having to read instructions). A good door has a push/pull sign to make it self-explanatory, but it still requires you to read and think. An even better door wouldn’t even need that label at all—you know what to do instinctively.</p>



<p>But somehow, we’ve perverted that idea. Users are lazy, even stupid, we say. They just want to flick their fingers down an infinite feed, letting their eyes wander from item to item.</p>



<p>But in <em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, Krug never refers to users in a derogatory way. He tells us how good products should work, and why basic psychology supports that. People want to reduce cognitive friction as much as possible. People don’t like unneeded cognitive friction. People skim quickly and “muddle through” products. And, most of all, people won’t undertake effort unless they believe it’s worth the cost. These are all facts backed by usability research and psychology.</p>



<p>In other words, he tells us <em>what</em> good products should look like, and <em>how</em> people use them. But he doesn’t pass judgment on users. That’s up to us.</p>



<p>And so naturally, we apply our view of the world, our values. If you view your users with contempt, then the reason behind why people don’t like complicated products is because they are stupid and lazy. If, on the other hand, you <em>respect</em> your users, you might view things differently.</p>



<p>Firstly, our brains have been wired, through millions of years of evolution, to conserve effort and time. That’s actually not being lazy, it’s being smart and protective of one of our most valuable assets. Naturally, we don’t undertake an activity unless we believe it’s worth the cost (though there are ways to trick us, more on that later). And if it takes effort to even figure out how much effort an activity will require, we’ll avoid that activity altogether. That’s the functional, practical piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>Secondly, we are a complex bundle of emotions. Even if we’re smart, we don’t like <em>feeling</em> stupid. And complex, difficult things makes us feel stupid. They strike at our very identity and self-worth. So we try to avoid them like we avoid that hard topic we were never good at in school. <em>That</em> part is the emotional piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>So what explains the rise of products like Facebook, which have gotten a large part of humanity mindlessly scrolling through feeds of what can most easily be described as garbage content? Well, we humans aren’t perfect. If you’ve got billions of dollars, some of the brightest minds, and a lot of data at your disposal, you can get a lot of people to do what you want. If you treat users as stupid and lazy, you can turn them into stupid and lazy people in the context of your product… but that’s a subject for another post.</p>



<p>So here’s how I think about people and product design.</p>



<p>Firstly, products should definitely be as simple as possible. Because I <em>respect </em>users’ time, not because I look down on their intelligence.</p>



<p>Second, have a theory of how people behave. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">Self-determination Theory</a>, which states that people value autonomy, relatedness, and competence. And I love building product that help people improve all those three dimensions.</p>



<p>Three, have a set of principles for your product. For instance, of the three axes of self-determination, I particularly care about autonomy (control). And I’ve found that good products, ones that respect their users, <em>give them more control</em>. Bad products <em>take away control</em>. Simplicity can fulfill both of those purposes. It can give people control by abstracting away things they don’t care about and helping them focus. Or it can take away control by only letting users do things the product’s designers want them to do. So that’s one of my principles: give people control. Help them do things <em>they </em>want to do, not things <em>you</em> want them to do.</p>



<p>Let’s respect our users. Technology can bring out the best or worst in us, both individually and collectively. Let’s focus on the best.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The above article is what I wrote, in its half-formed state on a Sunday morning. It looks like it’s blowing up on HackerNews, so I wanted to just add a few points.</p>



<ul><li>I know I can come across as idealistic. I’ve even gotten that as feedback on a formal performance review (but also, I’ve gotten that I’m cynical, so *shrug*). I’m not saying people can’t be lazy, entitled, or stupid. We can. We have that <em>capacity</em>. But we have the <em>capacity</em> for so much more than that. And we should focus our tools, our technology, on our best capacities.</li><li>If Self-determination Theory resonates with you, I’d urge you to think about how it applies to building teams or even parenting. Your employees and colleagues, or your children and family members, have all the human capacities as well (though obviously, for children, they are still under development). Since I’m much more experienced at managing teams (dozen years) than being a parent (two years), I’ll just say that companies that view employees as lazy and incompetent are a scourge. If you can afford to avoid working at companies like that, try your best. And if you’re tasked with building companies or teams, you get to choose. You still need rules, hierarchies, and processes, but if you give people autonomy and relatedness/purpose, and trust their competence, I hope you’ll be pleasantly surprised. If you treat employees as stupid and lazy, they will be.</li><li>On simplicity vs. control/flexibility: I’m a big fan of the Alan Kay quote that “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>.” I think great products find a way of achieving both those objectives. You keep things simple, but don’t throw out the baby with the bath-water. Like the word processor. 99% of the time, you just want to type some text, so you get a cursor and WYSIWIG typing. But sometimes, you want to style, you want to indent, you want to program macros. We apply this principle often at <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> (personal finance platform that I’m working on) and so far have found it to be quite successful.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post covers why I believe local and national governments should
adopt and invest in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS).</p>

<p>This has been in the news recently due to the city of Munich renewing 
it’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-not-windows-why-munich-is-shifting-back-from-microsoft-to-open-source-again/">LiMux Linux distribution</a>
thanks to an agreement between the local SDP and Green politicians, and
the efforts of the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money, Public Code</a> campaign.</p>

<h2 id="limux">LiMux</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux">LiMux</a> is a project by the German city of Munich to migrate its desktop
infrastructure to FOSS solutions, specifically to the LiMux Linux
distribution (based on Ubuntu) and LibreOffice (initially to OpenOffice). The project was started in 2004, and
migration began in 2006.</p>

<p>By the end of 2013, 15,000 desktops had been migrated successfully.
However, in September 2016 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-germany-moves-into-a-new-headquarters/">Microsoft announced the opening of a new headquarters in Munich</a>, and then
in 2017 the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10/">city council decided to switch back to Microsoft Windows and Office</a>.
The timing of this decision led to many accusations of effective
bribery, using the potential office opening to pressure the council in to using
Microsoft products (note that there is no evidence of a kick-back scheme
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-pay-25m-to-doj-and-sec-in-hungary-bribery-case/">like practiced by Microsoft Hungary</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200506-01.en.html">this decision has now been reversed</a>, and LiMux 
development and roll-out will continue.</p>

<h2 id="other-cities">Other cities</h2>

<p>Munich is not the only city choosing Free Software solutions, many
others are beginning to see the potential benefits too. In Catalonia,
Barcelona’s <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/es/transformacion-digital/tecnologia-para-un-gobierno-mejor/software-libre">Digital Transformation programme supports Free Software</a>.
From first-hand experience this means that the government transport /
road organisation use LibreOffice for all documents - so local driving
schools, etc. do not need a copy of Microsoft Office to handle the
necessary digital paperwork.</p>

<p>In Valencia, <a href="https://www.muylinux.com/2013/08/22/generalitat-valenciana-libreoffice/">the local government migrated its administration and
schools to LibreOffice</a>
saving 1.5 million euros per year, and saving students and other
end-users from having to purchase their own copies of Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>However, it is not always straightforward. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/737818/">Munich faced a lot of push-back in some areas</a>, and the <a href="https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/politica/colau-gasta-4-5-millones-en-microsoft-mientras-promete-software-libre_32165_102.html">city of Barcelona still pays almost 5 million
euros</a>
in license costs to Microsoft.</p>

<p>The main issue here is not so much the direct cost to the city itself
(which is substantial, but not critical compared to other costs -
especially since any migration will incur a significant short-term
cost), but more that the cost must be paid over and over again by all
users separately. Barcelona continues to pay millions to Microsoft every
year, but so will other cities in Spain and across Europe, and then so will all
users of those services that may have to use a copy of Microsoft Office for
compatibility reasons (i.e. students and small businesses).</p>

<p>The same cost is paid over and over again to a foreign company that will
not hire local developers or invest in the local economy, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft#Vendor_lock-in">uses vendor lock-in</a>
to eventually control all of the critical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-foss">Benefits of FOSS</h2>

<p>The most commonly cited benefit of Free Software is certainly the cost
savings vs. proprietary licensing. Whilst this can be a benefit
in some circumstances, I think it overlooks many greater far-reaching
benefits, and may not actually manifest itself in the short-term due to
the additional costs of the actual migration (i.e. costs of deployment
and training).</p>

<h3 id="shared-investment">Shared investment</h3>

<p>The main benefit of using FOSS solutions is that any investment in the
development and improvement of the software also benefits all other
users of the software.</p>

<p>That is, whilst the city of Munich might need <a href="https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux">some improvements in
handling templates</a>, other cities
might need other improvements - however they can all benefit from
each others’ investment, with no need to pay again just to keep a license.</p>

<p>This helps to build up a commonwealth of high-quality, well-maintained
software which anyone can use. There is no central, unique
owner of the projects (any project could be forked if necessary), so
there is no company that can demand payments just to allow you to keep using the
existing software.</p>

<p>Any investment in development made is truly an investment, leading directly
to project improvements, rather than just money sent to a foreign
company whilst the customers have no ownership of the actual product,
allowing the company to charge even more in the future just for the
right to keep using it (usually this is done by giving discounts for the
early migration which then result in higher prices later once the
customer is locked in).</p>

<p>Note that this initial investment might be higher than the current costs
of existing proprietary software licensing, when considering the
migration and training costs and possible development costs. However,
unlike those licensing costs it is a one-time cost, and the customer
retains some ownership over the resulting product (i.e. there is not a
license that can be revoked).</p>

<h3 id="freedom-for-development">Freedom for development</h3>

<p>There is also more freedom in the development process. The fact that the
products aren’t owned by a company means that contributions can be made
by anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Users of the software (such as the cities mentioned above) could fund
<a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops">local co-operatives of developers</a> to add desired features and maintain
the projects, instead of being forced to fund a foreign corporation with
no local investment.</p>

<p>In the long-term this might also help to break up some of the monopolistic
Big Tech companies, and result in a freer society and business
environment for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="national-security">National security</h3>

<p>In Europe especially, the current dependence on proprietary software
often means a dependence on foreign corporations which operate in
co-operation with their country’s intelligence service. As revealed by
Edward Snowden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">Microsoft provided backdoor access to encrypted messages</a> to
the NSA, CIA and FBI as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM programme</a>.</p>

<p>It is indefensible that such a company can run the critical infrastructure
of the vast majority of local and central government administrations, as
well as personal computers. Especially when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel">NSA has been proven to
intercept communications of supposedly allied nations</a>.</p>

<p>With FOSS software there is no central company to be pressured by
intelligence services or build in backdoors. All of the code can be
scrutinised by developers and users. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s Law</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same concept applies to introducing backdoors to access private data. It
might be possible to pressure or bribe one company to do so, but it
isn’t possible to do the same to tens of thousands of independent users and
developers.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture">Bigger picture</h2>

<p>The effects of co-ordinated FOSS adoption are much more far-reaching and
positive than solely saving the costs of current software licenses.</p>

<p>The adoption of FOSS and investment by many governments (at all levels)
would help to create a commonwealth of quality Free Software for all
citizens and government bodies to benefit from.</p>

<p>It would also allow development of these projects to be done from
anywhere, allowing users to fund local developers or co-operatives. This
would help to break up the massive, monopolistic Big Tech companies, and
could also be used as a way of bringing investment and jobs to parts of
the country/region that require it.</p>

<p>This would also be highly beneficial to developers, as they would have
more control over their own work (as they are not tied to the few
employers that own these popular products), and would also likely be
able to negotiate a larger portion of the compensation directly since
there would not be the overhead of salespeople and lawyers, etc. present in
current large software companies.</p>

<p>All Free Software users would benefit from the greater usage and
investment - GNU/Linux users could expect better hardware support for
example, as it becomes more commonplace.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h2>

<p>Whilst the benefits of adopting FOSS are clear, the cases in Munich and
Hungary show that it will not be an easy path to greater adoption. We
cannot just rely on central government eventually carry out the adoption
as the few representatives are easily pressured by the beneficiaries of
the status quo, and are serving a much larger political platform.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the solution lies in applying “Linus’s Law” to
politics itself. It is no coincidence that the successes in FOSS
adoption so far have been concentrated in local government - in specific
city councils and regional administrations, because it is easier for
engaged groups of citizens to have a direct effect in local government.</p>

<p>At a national level, it might be possible for a large software company
to pressure a few political leaders and policy makers, however, it is
much harder to do the same to a whole board of a dozen or more local
councillors (especially across the multitude of different counties and
regional administrations). There is “safety in numbers” as it becomes
unfeasible to pressure and manipulate large groups of
politically-engaged citizens.</p>

<p>It it is the responsibility of every citizen in a democratic society not
only to inform themselves and vote in national elections, but also to really partake in the
political system: by joining a political party, taking part in local and
regional elections, and ensuring that the democratic standards are
upheld both inside the party and in political institutions.</p>

<p>This should have support from across the political spectrum, as
guaranteeing the security and privacy of citizens’ data whilst also
cutting out the middlemen of massive foreign corporations, shouldn’t be
a controversial policy.</p>

<p>Efforts in local politics have already proven successful, such as the
LiMux project and others mentioned previously. So if you agree with the
points raised here I hope you will join whichever local political party
you agree most with, and help to bring about FOSS adoption by your
government.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Greater FOSS adoption by our governments benefits the administrations
themselves by being free …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We write so many functions in our programs that they become second nature before we know it. Like ants in a colony, they are numerous beyond imagination and they come together to form some surprisingly complex systems.</p><p>It begs the question: how do we write good functions? It can seem trivial: theyâ€™re just like ants after-all. But there is leverage in the answer: the right decisions multiply throughout your codebase and bubble up into great design.</p><p>I think there are about three key ideas you can employ to craft good functions. I wanted to share them with you.</p><p>Letâ€™s start with an example. We have an app, and we want to export some data in a JSON format. Hereâ€™s what a function for that could look like:</p><pre><code>function exportFile() { 
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = getData(); // [Data, Data, Data]
    const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
    const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(exportableData); // '{"data": {...
    const fileURL = saveFile("export.json", jsonStr); // https://foo.com/export.json
    setFileURL(fileURL);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}</code></pre><p>Seems straight forward: To export as JSON, we first get our data. Now, this data may have some sensitive info, so we clean that up and transform into something exportable; ExportableData. Once we have that, we get a string representation, save the file, and badabing, badaboom, weâ€™re done. </p><p>Okay, weâ€™ve got something working well.</p><p>But life moves on and our program needs to evolve. Instead of just exporting JSON, we need to do more: <strong>we also need to export a CSV file</strong>. </p><p>How do we do that?</p><p>The first thing we notice, is that exporting a CSV is very similar to exporting JSON. Can we abstract <code>exportFile</code>?</p><p>One thing we can do, is to introduce a new flag: something like <code>exportFile(/*isCSV=*/ true)</code> </p><pre><code>function exportFile(isCSV) { 
  ...
  let fileURL
  if (isCSV) { 
    const csvStr = toCSVStr(exportableData)
    fileURL = saveFile("export.csv", jsonStr);
  } else { 
    const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(exportableData);
    fileURL = saveFile("export.json", jsonStr);
  }
  ...</code></pre><p>By introducing this flag, we can conditionally produce a different <code>fileURL</code>: one for CSV and one for JSON. With that we see the first concept for abstraction: configuration. You pass some configuration, and you leave it to your function to figure what to do. </p><p>So, is it a good idea? </p><h2>The key <em>advantage</em> is that our logic is centralized.</h2><p>With configuration, the caller is limited in what they can do: they can only provide flags. All the true logic stays inside <code>exportFile</code>. This means that callers of the function canâ€™t go crazy and do something unsupported. And that could give us some peace of mind.</p><h2>The key <em>disadvantage</em> is thatâ€¦our logic is centralized.</h2><p>This will work, but letâ€™s think about it. First, notice that in order to understand <code>exportFile</code> now, we need to understand both the CSV and JSON case. Imagine if someone opens up <code>exportFile</code> to figure out what it does:  if they <em>only</em> cared about JSON, they now have to understand more logic than they needed. Anyone who changes the logic for CSV, may also end up breaking JSON. <code>**exportFile**</code> <strong>has become</strong> <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank"><strong>complected</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Notice also, that because the caller of this function can <em>only</em> provide flags, their hands are tied for use-cases that you didnâ€™t support. This was supposed to give you peace of mind, but it certainly can frustrate callers. imagine if they wanted to support XML, what could they do? Theyâ€™d have to edit <code>exportFile</code> to support this case. (God forbid they edit it to be something like <code>exportFile(isCSV, isXML)</code> â€” now you have invariant conditions on your hands). By being so specific, youâ€™ve chosen to make your function less abstract â€” this of course means that it is less powerful.  <code>**exportFile**</code> <strong>has become hard to extend</strong></p><h2>For better or worse, configuration gives the caller the least amount of power</h2><p>If you imagine a sort power spectrum, where the caller has the least power on the left, and most power on the right, configuration would be on the left. You control what the caller does so tightly that it gives your certainty, but makes your function more complex and less useful. </p><p>Say you wanted to address the problems, and move to the right of this spectrum, what could you do? </p><p>Well, if you look at what we wrote, we can notice that the only part that is <em>really</em> different, is the bit about taking <code>exportData</code>, and creating a <code>fileURL</code>. </p><pre><code>...
const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
... // *This can be different! Somehow we need to get a fileURL* 
setFileURL(fileURL);
...</code></pre><p>So one thing we can do is this: instead of providing a flag, we can provide a function: </p><pre><code>function exportFile(exportableDataToFileURL) { 
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const data = getData(); // [Data, Data, Data]
    const exportableData = toExportableData(data); // ExportableData
    const fileURL = exportableDataToFileURL(exportableData)
    setFileURL(fileURL);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}</code></pre><p>Now, for JSON, we can write </p><pre><code>exportFile((exportableData) =&gt; { 
  return saveFile("export.json", JSON.stringify(exportableData));
})</code></pre><p>and for CSV we can write: </p><pre><code>exportFile((exportableData) =&gt; { 
  return saveFile("export.csv", toCSVStr(exportableData));
})</code></pre><p>Oky doke, this is cool. </p><h2>The key <em>advantage</em> is that you give the caller more power</h2><p>With this we solve both of the problems we had with configuration. Now if someone looks under the hood at <code>exportFile</code>, they wonâ€™t see unrelated code about csv. If they wanted to extend to XML, they can simply provide a different function. Weâ€™ve given the caller much more power</p><h2>The key <em>disadvantage</em> is that it can be either too powerful or not powerful enough</h2><p>Weâ€™ve abstracted further, but there is a price there. The first is, that we <em>think</em> we know that what we <em>really</em> need to pass outwards is <code>exportableData</code>, and what we need to return is a <code>fileURL</code>. What if we were wrong? For example, some may need a slightly different data format â€” instead of <code>exportableData</code> they need <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>. By the time we figured that out, itâ€™s possible that there are numerous new usages of <code>exportFile</code>, which weâ€™ll have to support as we evolve this function.</p><p>One way we could have prevented this, is to have stuck with configuration. This way, anyone who wanted to support something would have to funnel through this function, which would give us time to think about what the best abstraction was. </p><p>Another way, would have been if this function was abstracted even further, so callers could have easily supported <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>.</p><h2>Inversion lies in the middle of the power spectrum</h2><p>Inversion is more powerful than configuration, but itâ€™s not the most powerful method. This can be a great choice, but you risk either being too powerful and exposing errors, or not being powerful enough and restricting callers. </p><p>We know the less powerful option: configuration. What would the most powerful one look like?</p><p>The next thing we may notice, is that our <code>exportFile</code> function is actually built up some building blocks that could be useful for a bunch of different things. For example, many functions may want a loading state, or just need to get <code>exportableData</code>, etc. We could create those building blocks:</p><pre><code>function exportJSONFile() { 
  withLoading(() =&gt; saveJSONFile(getExportableData()))
}


function exportCSVFile() { 
  withLoading(() =&gt; saveCSVFile(getExportableData()))
}</code></pre><h2>The key advantage is that the user gets the most power</h2><p>The building blocks that we just built, can be used in a myriad of ways. The user can support CSV, XML, can use <code>isLoading</code> with some other function, and choose to provide a different kind of <code>exportableData</code>.  Weâ€™ve provided a lot of power for the user.</p><h2>The key disadvantage is that you are the most vulnerable to mistakes</h2><p>The disadvantage though, like in the case of inversion, is that we open ourselves up to a lot of mistakes. What if <code>isLoading</code> was really meant for files, and other things should have been using a different flag? What if people start using <code>saveJSONFile</code>, and pass data that wasnâ€™t really an export? These are all cases that we have implicitly allowed with our abstractions. </p><p>Thereâ€™s a further problem: notice that with our first example of <code>exportFile</code>, you the code was more concrete: you could see what was actually happening. When code is more abstract, itâ€™s a bit harder to reason about what is <em>actually</em> happening. Now, it can be worth it for the power gains, but if you optimized prematurely, youâ€™re just paying this price for nothing. An example of this unnecessary price is <code>saveJSONFile</code> and <code>saveCSVFile</code> â€” if we had <a href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html" target="_blank">inlined</a> those, the overall composition would still be abstract but more understandable. These are the kind of things to watch out for as you abstract at this level.</p><h2>Composition is at the end of the spectrum</h2><p>And with that, we see that composition gives us the most power, but gives us the most opportunities to shoot ourselves in the foot. Boy can it be worth it though. </p><p>Itâ€™s funny to notice that with each option, the pro <em>is</em> the con. So how do we pick? I think one heuristic you can use is this: pick the most powerful option you can limited by your confidence. For example, if you have a light understanding of the problem, stay on the lower side of the abstraction spectrum. As you understand more (say, time to introduce XML) you can evolve to the powerful side of the spectrum. When youâ€™re <em>very</em> confident, and you can see good use-cases for your building blocks, lean to the most powerful side of the spectrum. </p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Julien Odent for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>My goal writing documentation is to enable a student to learn, give them confidence they can learn, and not just copy-paste their way.</p>



<p>This is not easy and I’m still learning myself what is the best way to organize any given set. This post covers my thinking around, it is a deeper follow on to previous <a href="https://mkaz.blog/misc/notes-on-technical-writing/">notes on technical writing</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.</p><cite>The Humanity of Muad’Dib by the Princess Irulan [^1]</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>For documentation you can create a tutorial that walks a student through a serious of steps and — assuming they have a close enough setup to yours — it will all work as expected. However, did they learn something? Beyond, if I copy and paste these commands from that site it works.</p>



<p>What happens when the student has a different setup? Maybe they tried the tutorial 6 months ago, gave up and are coming back again but now with the detritus of their failed attempt. Maybe they are using an outdated version or you haven’t updated your tutorial with the newer version.</p>



<p>These are a few of the countless differences that lead to students getting frustrated, giving up, walking away, and telling themselves it is too hard, this is not for me. The student will stop trying to understand and rely on copy-paste, <em>if I just use Google enough I can find the right code</em>.</p>



<h2>Narrative Construction</h2>



<p>How to create your documentation to help students?</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner">Jerome Bruner</a> studied human cognitive psychology and developed a learning theory of narrative construction. This is that students create a narrative that constructs their view of a concept, as new ideas come in they add and modify their view to fit the ideas.</p>



<p>The goal of your documentation then is to provide new information that can be used to expand (and/or correct) their view of the fundamental structure of the subject.</p>



<p>For example in WordPress when I’m documenting a feature for the new editor it may require reinforcing a proper understanding of how plugins work, since new features are added using plugins.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The teaching and learning of structure, rather than simply the mastery of facts and techniques is at the center of the classic problem of (knowledge) transfer” [^2]</p></blockquote>



<p>The explaining and understanding of the fundamental structure is critical to learning a subject. However, this does not require over explaining or confusing the student. You don’t need to dive so deep into the fundamentals that for example saving a file you end up covering the magnetic properties of hard drives.</p>



<p>An example adapted from Bruner’s Process of Education:</p>



<p>To learn algebra, solving an equation with unknowns, say <code>3x + 7 = 16</code>, a student must grasp the ideas of commutation and association. It is not important a student knows the formal name and definitions of these mathematical properties — I have a degree in mathematics and still had to look the names for this post. What is important is the learning the underlying structure and rules on how to use them, it is often unconscious.</p>



<p>Likewise for writing, a student must have an understanding of the rules of English and sentence structure, but formal names are not needed to know these two sentences express the same action: “The ball was thrown by the boy.” and “The boy threw the ball.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“Giving students an understanding of the fundamental structure of whatever subjects we choose to teach. This is a minimum requirement for using knowledge, for bringing it to bear on problems and events one encounters outside a classroom.” [^3]</p></blockquote>



<p>This understanding of structure and developing an intuition on what can be done and how things work is critical to actually learning and being able to solve some of the issues outlined at the beginning.</p>



<h2>Techniques to Encourage Learning</h2>



<p>As I said above, this is by no means an easy task and depending on subject, student, and instructor there is plenty of variance of working techniques and implementation. Here are a few suggestions:</p>



<ol><li>Learning is an active process</li><li>Encourage action through dialog</li><li>Use mixed media</li><li>Include exercises</li><li>Self Discovery</li><li>Spiral Organization</li><li>Troubleshooting</li></ol>



<h3>Learning is an active process</h3>



<p><strong>Learning is an active process</strong>, the student must engage with the work and actively do something, be it typing, working out problems on their own, or whatever, there needs to be some sort of engagement.</p>



<p>As a writer of documentation, you can not solely rely on the student’s motivation and desire to learn. You need to create your documentation and systems in a way to encourage engagement.</p>



<p>A great example of this is <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A Tour of Go</a> that presents a split screen of instruction on the left and an active working playground to write and test code. 👌</p>



<h3>Active Dialog</h3>



<p>In your writing engage in an active dialog, invite the students to act. You can include phrases like “Please try”, “See what happens”, “Explore yourself”. The goal here is to empower the student to have confidence to try and explore, so they can apply the concepts they are learning immediately.</p>



<p>If you can, create your tutorial in a way that encourages creating and destroying a dummy project. If a student knows that they can mess things up, but then recover it will encourage experimentation.</p>



<p>A good example of this is the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React practical tutorial</a>; it includes a pre-built environment using CodePen, one click to have a new setup.</p>



<h3>Use Mixed Media</h3>



<p>People have different learning styles, so it is important to vary your forms of media to communicate the subject matter. For example, don’t just rely on text to describe, you can include a diagram to illustrate a system or workflow.</p>



<p>Also, don’t feel bad about repeating yourself, if you publish something in a video and also include text, you don’t know what will connect with people and help them grasp the ideas and concepts.</p>



<p>An example: I noticed this when documenting a git workflow about pull requests, there are several steps involving different repositories and machines. My text description explained it well, but including this diagram can help someone visualize where and how the steps flow.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="609" src="https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-1024x609.png" alt="" srcset="https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-1024x609.png 1024w , https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-300x178.png 300w , https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-768x457.png 768w , https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-1200x713.png 1200w , https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280-600x357.png 600w , https://149354403.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/git-workflow-1280.png 1280w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Example Use of Diagram</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Self Discovery</h3>



<p>A technique you see in a classroom but rarely in documentation is the withholding of information and requiring the student to discover the answer on their own, applying what they learn.</p>



<p>This technique works much better for tutorials then reference documentation, you don’t want to be withhold info from your API to let the developer “figure it out”.</p>



<p>This goes back to the concept in my technical writing notes that there are <a href="https://mkaz.blog/misc/notes-on-technical-writing/#types-of-documentation">different types of documentation</a> and you need to cater your writing and techniques to these different audiences.</p>



<p>You can do both, ask a question to engage the student but hide the answer and let them think then reveal. Using the details and summary HTML tags allows you to add this small part of interactivity.</p>



<details>
<summary>What tag can you use to hide and reveal information?</summary>
<p>Is this too meta? See the MDN docs for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">details tag usage</a>.</p>
</details>



<h3>Exercises</h3>



<p>You can include exercises for the students to do. Just like in a school math book, explain the concepts, show an example, and then give an exercise for the student to complete demonstrating their knowledge of the concept.</p>



<p>An excerpt from one of my favorite documentation, the <a href="https://mkaz.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IBM-Displaywriter-Manual.pdf">IBM Displaywriter Operating manual</a> at the end of each topic they include an ON YOUR OWN section:</p>



<blockquote><p>ON YOUR OWN</p><p>You can use these techniques to insert and then delete underlined and centered material. Experiment with deletion. When you are finished, END the Smith Letter document, and then print it out</p></blockquote>



<h3>Spiral Organization</h3>



<p>Organize your documentation in a spiral structure that continually builds upon previous knowledge. Students learn by constructing their view of the system, your documentation needs to slowly help them build a correct view.</p>



<p>Creating good spiral documentation requires careful consideration of the students and trying create documents for people at various skill levels. You want to aim for the lowest levels to the point of almost over-explaining, because more experienced developers can skim to the points that interest.</p>



<p>Your document does not need to cover everything, <strong>use links generously</strong>. By linking to lower-level concepts or additional details, you allow those who are interested or need that information to explore without muddling the goal of your document.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>specify your assumptions</strong> up front. If the tutorial is intended for experienced developers without knowledge of your framework; or is it intended for beginners. This requires you thinking about what you assume when writing the documents.</p>



<p>A good example of specifying assumptions is <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React documentation</a> again. They have a section titled “Knowledge Level Assumptions” and even include links to help.</p>



<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>



<p>Allow for mistakes. As mentioned in the active dialog section above, give instructions on how does a student start over or recover from mistakes.</p>



<p>As you are creating your documentation, keep track of all the little things you did wrong, all the error messages you see, anything that trips you up. Include all these mistakes in a “Troubleshooting” section.</p>



<blockquote><p>What might they see if they run something wrong?<br>What if they make a change and nothing happens?<br>An error popped up, what does it mean, what to do?</p></blockquote>



<p>This requires creating your documentation with thoughtfulness on everything you write. For example, if you are creating a doc for beginner JavaScript and you mention an error will show in the console log, you need to link to or explain where is the console log and how to show it.</p>



<p>If you are writing a doc for advanced JavaScript you probably can assume they know about the console log. The challenge often tends to be, how do you know if the student is a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> <span>This post is part of my <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/">Today I learned</a> series in which I share all my learnings regarding web development.</span></p><div><p>User preferences and settings play an essential role in how websites look in 2020. To name two examples: well-made websites look great on different devices and handle various font-size settings with ease.</p><p>Over the past few years, a new user preference made it into the group of things "that change how a website looks" – yes, I'm talking about color themes. "How to implement dark mode on a website?" was one of the most important topics in 2019.</p><p><em>(yes... this site will have a dark mode eventually, too)</em></p><p>But how can you enable dark mode then? With today's web technology, your site can react to your visitors' color preferences (coming from the operating system) using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query</a>. This media query allows you to write CSS depending on the preferred color scheme.</p><pre><code><span>--color-one</span><span>:</span> #ff0000<span>;</span>
<span>--color-two</span><span>:</span> #00ff00<span>;</span>

<span><span>@media</span> <span>(</span><span>prefers-color-scheme</span><span>:</span> dark<span>)</span></span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>--color-one</span><span>:</span> #00ffff<span>;</span>
  <span>--color-two</span><span>:</span> #ff00ff<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>Technically, this approach is straight forward, but implementing a high-quality theme handling is not trivial. It includes way more than just switching some colors. To learn more, I recommend reading <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac">Thomas Steiner's</a> excellent guide on this topic: <a href="https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/">"prefers-color-scheme: Hello darkness, my old friend"</a>.</p><h2 id="dont-forget-to-indicate-your-sites-supported-color-schemes"><a href="#dont-forget-to-indicate-your-sites-supported-color-schemes">#</a> Don't forget to indicate your site's supported color schemes</h2><p>Having the ability to style websites depending on user color settings is excellent, but unfortunately, it's not covering the whole picture. So what's missing?</p><p>Even after writing hundreds of custom CSS lines, there are usually elements still relying on browser default styling. It could be a text input field, a checkbox, a radio button, or even the good old scroll bar using the CSS rules in the browser's user agent stylesheet. <strong>The browser doesn't know about your color scheme and comes with default styles based on a light mode.</strong> These styles define dark text and highlights on a bright background.</p><p>To complete your color scheme and make all your elements dark mode compatible, you have to define and overwrite all these CSS rules from the user agent stylesheet. This process is not ideal!</p><p>The <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust/#propdef-color-scheme"><code>color-scheme</code> property</a> helps here. It allows you to give browsers the information on your website's supported color schemes.</p><p><code>color-scheme</code> accepts two values:</p><ul><li><code>normal</code> – your site/an element does not support color schemes</li><li><code>[ light | dark | &lt;custom-ident&gt; ]+</code> – your site or a specific element can be rendered with the defined color schemes (<code>custom-ident</code> is currently unsupported and is only defined for possible future use cases)</li></ul><p>You can set these values as an HTML meta element or as a CSS declaration.</p><pre><code>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>color-scheme<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dark light<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>color-scheme</span><span>:</span> dark light<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>With this information, browsers can improve their default styling to match defined color schemes. With adjusted user agent styles, you don't have to overwrite every color to make an element dark mode compatible because the browser took care of it already.</p><p><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust/#preferred">The spec defines the following behavior</a> when a <code>color-scheme</code> property is defined:</p><blockquote><p>If the author has indicated that the page can support this color scheme, the user agent must match the following to the user’s preferred color scheme:</p><ul><li>the color of the canvas surface</li><li>the default colors of scrollbars and other interaction UI</li><li>the default colors of form controls and other "specially-rendered" elements</li><li>the default colors of other browser-provided UI, such as "spellcheck" underlines</li></ul></blockquote><p>For the example of dark mode, this paragraph means: <strong>if a site claims to support a dark color scheme, the browser must provide dark mode compatible colors, form controls, scroll bars and other UI elements.</strong></p><p>This browser behavior makes it easier to build color-schemed UIs because default UI elements adjust their color automatically. You can avoid overwriting every color! 🎉</p><h2 id="browser-support-of-color-scheme"><a href="#browser-support-of-color-scheme">#</a> Browser support of <code>color-scheme</code></h2><p>If you <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_meta_name_color-scheme">go to caniuse.com to check the browser support of <code>color-scheme</code></a>, you'll be surprised. It looks reasonably good and it seems that only Firefox is missing to support <code>color-scheme</code>.</p><div><figure><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 2636 926"><path fill="#dfd8c1" d="M0 0h2636v916H0z"></path><g transform="translate(5.1 5.1) scale(10.29688)" fill-opacity=".5"><ellipse fill="#28570c" cx="109" cy="66" rx="35" ry="17"></ellipse><path fill="#1c5f12" d="M145.5 72.6l-15 .8-2-38 15-.8z"></path><path fill="#2a1e06" d="M144 63h62v5h-62z"></path><ellipse fill="#fff4e6" rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(-33.1947 22.54252 -57.06763 -84.03422 244.1 55.8)"></ellipse><path fill="#47470a" d="M51 63h84v5H51z"></path><ellipse fill="#fff8e8" rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(28.7783 11.16237 -14.04152 36.2012 23.4 56.5)"></ellipse><path fill="#fff9ee" d="M113 0h15v62h-15z"></path><path fill="#932000" d="M2 13h21v6H2z"></path></g></svg> <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png"><img width="1000" height="351" srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=300&amp;h=105 300w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=500&amp;h=175 500w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=700&amp;h=245 700w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=900&amp;h=316 900w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=1100&amp;h=386 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 50em) 98vw, 700px" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/6d0UJcg8d5ONEZMmJgfL31/9730c548d76ab7c11a75470b1d36ad16/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.05.36.png" alt="caniuse.com support table showing that color-scheme is mainly supported only with Firefox missing" loading="lazy" onload="this.classList.add('kf-fade-in')"></a></figure></div><p>Unfortunately, this support table is not telling the whole truth.

This approach allows us to have a look at which elements react to different color schemes.</p><div><figure><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1796 1409"><path fill="#858585" d="M0 0h1796v1403H0z"></path><g transform="translate(3.5 3.5) scale(7.01563)" fill-opacity=".5"><ellipse cx="130" cy="160" rx="255" ry="62"></ellipse><ellipse fill="#fff" cx="111" cy="48" rx="255" ry="52"></ellipse><ellipse fill="#fff" rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(-197.82802 -11.0603 2.81686 -50.3833 128 48.8)"></ellipse><ellipse rx="1" ry="1" transform="rotate(-164.9 94.8 71) scale(128.65061 57.80774)"></ellipse><path fill="#fff" d="M223 108h31v21h-31z"></path><ellipse rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(-13.04437 45.49111 -124.52932 -35.7082 168.8 157.6)"></ellipse><ellipse fill="#fff" cx="204" cy="27" rx="255" ry="73"></ellipse><path d="M0 100h216v29H0z"></path></g></svg> <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png"><img width="1000" height="784" srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=500&amp;h=392 500w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=700&amp;h=549 700w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=900&amp;h=706 900w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=1100&amp;h=862 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 50em) 98vw, 700px" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/5k4hoL8mr6IhqvHppox7xh/e1f0421a910f195bff1e742571eb65ab/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_13.25.33.png" alt="Chrome UI elements not responding to color-scheme: dark" loading="lazy" onload="this.classList.add('kf-fade-in')"></a></figure></div><p>As you see above, Chrome and Edge 85 are changing the background and text color, but UI elements like inputs and buttons stay the same.</p><div><figure><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1803 1396"><path fill="#919191" d="M0 0h1803v1394H0z"></path><g transform="translate(3.5 3.5) scale(7.04297)" fill-opacity=".5"><ellipse cx="102" cy="154" rx="255" ry="55"></ellipse><ellipse fill="#fff" cx="127" cy="38" rx="255" ry="62"></ellipse><ellipse fill="#fff" cx="91" cy="41" rx="255" ry="59"></ellipse><ellipse rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(-173.1075 -21.25493 5.78204 -47.09095 133.8 151.2)"></ellipse><path fill="#fff" d="M227 29h25v97h-25z"></path><ellipse fill="#fff" rx="1" ry="1" transform="matrix(-4.20117 46.16306 -224.3933 -20.42139 134.8 49)"></ellipse><path d="M165 100h91v6h-91z"></path><ellipse fill="#fff" cx="65" cy="42" rx="255" ry="58"></ellipse></g></svg> <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png"><img width="1000" height="774" srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=300&amp;h=232 300w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=500&amp;h=387 500w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=700&amp;h=541 700w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=900&amp;h=696 900w, https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png?fm=jpg&amp;fit=scale&amp;q=75&amp;w=1100&amp;h=851 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 50em) 98vw, 700px" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f20lfrunubsq/4Iouaxc8SBottKsSKvoXsQ/2455d2dfbc99247c83e6597a017c6331/Screenshot_2020-09-13_at_14.09.58.png" alt="UI elements in Safari that are adjusting to color-scheme: dark" loading="lazy" onload="this.classList.add('kf-fade-in')"></a></figure></div><p>On the other hand, if you look at Safari, you'll see that inputs and buttons change their appearance and seamlessly integrate into a dark color scheme.

With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

For example, <code>AppKitToolbarCoordinator</code> adds a toolbar item, which triggers <code>NSHostingView.preferencesDidChange()</code>, causing everything to lay itself out once again, even though the toolbar size doesn’t change.</li></ul><p>The good news is there seem to be a lot of potential future optimizations possible to make this fast. Alternatively, there’s always the possibility of <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1304938866999046144?s=21">dropping out of SwiftUI for performance critical parts</a>.</p><p>This isn’t unique to Fruta. I’ve been taking a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian">@Dimillian’s</a> RedditOS app, which is built with SwiftUI on macOS. He <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1301802048824979456">stopped development</a> because it’s so slow that it’s not shippable. I did some debugging with an earlier version of Big Sur where the app still somewhat worked:</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The AppKit port of SwiftUI is... not very efficient. Been testing <a href="https://t.co/67UCuKmPts">https://t.co/67UCuKmPts</a> for a minute, 10% of the time it freezes on the main thread are just spent to... update toolbar buttons? It's a bit hard to measure because it crashes so quickly. <a href="https://t.co/hW4nNe0ydV">pic.twitter.com/hW4nNe0ydV</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1282655123244752897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>The general pattern here points to AppKit: The interaction between SwiftUI views and AppKit views <a href="https://twitter.com/fcbunn/status/1259078251340800000">seems to</a> be <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartcarnie/status/1301895206875181056">poor</a>. It’s important to understand that SwiftUI itself is fast — for many use cases it’s even faster than using <code>CALayer</code>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoawithlove/status/1143859576661393408">as @cocoawithlove proved</a> — and the UIKit port is by far faster and better than the AppKit port.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>If your target platform is iOS 14, you’re now good to go with hobby projects or individual screens in SwiftUI. I’m currently working on making our <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/">PDF SDK for iOS</a> easier to use with SwiftUI, and we’ll replace the settings/about screen of <a href="https://pdfviewer.io/">PDF Viewer</a> with a SwiftUI version.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t yet go all-in on SwiftUI for production apps, although the crash rate is likely manageable and Apple is actively improving things with every release. Remember that SwiftUI ships with the OS, not with your app, so any bug fixes will only help if your users update the OS.</p><p>Other ports are not so great. AppKit seems particularly troublesome, but I’ve also heard of big issues with tvOS. If you need to deploy your app to the Mac, use Catalyst, which is a much more stable binding and feels really good with Big Sur’s native mode, where content is no longer scaled.</p><p>If you’re curious about SwiftUI, <strong>please don’t let this dampen your enthusiasm</strong>. It’s extremely fun to write, it’s clearly the future at Apple, and all these issues will surely be resolved within a few years.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="why-i-want-to-find-data-science-podcasts">why i want to find data science podcasts</h2>
<p>This would normally be at the top of an article on finding data science podcasts. Well it would be at the top of any article. But realistically, most people are finding this from google, and they're just looking for the answer that's at the top of the page. If you type in 'the most popular data science podcasts', you really don't want to have to scroll down endlessly to find the answer you're looking for. So to make <em>their</em> experience better, we're just leaving the answer up there. And giving them sass. Lots of sass.</p>
<p>Anyways, I really like listening to things. While newsletters are great for keeping up with current events and blogs are great for learning specific things, podcasts have a special place in my heart for allowing me to aimlessly learn something new every day. The format really lends itself to delivering information efficiently, but in a way where you can multitask.  Pre-COVID, my morning commute was typically full of podcasts. While COVID has rendered my commute a nonexistent affair, I still try to listen to at least a podcast a day if I can manage it.  My view is that 30 minutes of learning a day will really add up in the long run, and I feel that podcasts are a great way to get there.</p>
<p>Now that we've been through my love affair with podcasts, you can imagine my surprise when I started looking for a few data science ones to subscribe to and I <em>didn't</em> find a tutorial on how to use web scraping to find the most popular data science podcasts to listen to.  I know, crazy.  There's a web scraping tutorial on everything under the sun except for - seemingly - podcasts.  I mean there's probably not one on newsletters either, but we'll leave that alone for now... </p>
<p>So if no one else is crazy enough to write about finding data science podcasts with web scraping, then...</p>
<h2 id="gameplanning-the-process">gameplanning the process</h2>
<p>By now we're almost certainly rid of those savages who are only here for the <strong>answer</strong> (<em>gasp, how could they</em>), so we'll go into the little process I went through to gather the data.  It's not particularly long, and took me probably an hour to put it together, so it should be a good length for an article.</p>
<p>I'm using python here with an installation of Anaconda (which is a common package management / deployment system for python).  I'll be running this in a Jupyter notebook, since its a one-off task that I don't need to use ever again... hopefully.</p>
<p>In terms of what I'm going to do, I'll run a few google keyword searches which are limited to the '<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/'" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/'</a> domain and scrape the results for the first few pages.  From there I'll just be scraping the apple podcast page to get the total number of ratings and the average rating. Yea, the data will be biased, but its a quick and dirty way to get the answer I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="code-to-find-top-data-science-podcasts---version-1">code to find top data science podcasts - version 1</h2>
<div><pre><code># import default python packages
import urllib
import requests
import time
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above packages are included in python, the below ones aren't always included. If you don't have them installed, you'll have to download them. You can find out how to use <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pip</a> to do it or <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/install-packages/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conda</a>. </p>
<div><pre><code># import non-standard python packages
# if you dont have these installed, install them with pip or conda
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the packages have been imported, you should define your user agent. First off, because its polite if you're scraping anything. Secondly, google gives different results for mobile and desktop searches.  This isn't actually my user-agent, I took it from another tutorial since I'm a bit lazy.  I actually use linux...</p>
<div><pre><code># define your desktop user-agent
USER_AGENT = "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0"
</code></pre></div>
<p>Alright now we're going to define the queries we want to run. And then create a function that spits out the URL we want to scrape on google.  I'm putting the queries in a kwargs format, since I want to put them through a function.  That means I can just loop through the list of kwargs and get the results that the function returns.</p>
<div><pre><code># Queries
list_kwargs = [
    {"string": 'data podcast'},
    {"string": 'data podcast', "pg": 2},
    {"string": 'data podcast', "pg": 3},

    {"string": 'data engineering podcast'},
    {"string": 'data visualization podcast'},
]

def string_to_podcast_query(string, pg=None):
    query = urllib.parse.quote_plus(f'site:https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ {string}')
    if pg != None:
        query = query + "&amp;start=" + str(10*(pg-1))
    return f"https://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=en&amp;q={query}", string

# define the headers we will add to all of our requests
headers = {"user-agent" : USER_AGENT}

# set up an empty list to push results to
results = []

# cycle through the list of queries 
for x in list_kwargs:
    # return the query url and the search term that was used to create it (for classification later)
    url, search_term = string_to_podcast_query(**x)

    # make a get request to the url, include the headers with our user-agent
    resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

    # only proceed if you get a 200 code that the request was processed correctly
    if resp.status_code == 200:
        # feed the request into beautiful soup
        soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.content, "html.parser")
    
    # find all divs (a css element that wraps page areas) within google results
    for g in soup.find_all('div', class_='r'):
        # within the results, find all the links 
        anchors = g.find_all('a')
        if anchors:

September 13, 2020 | https://notoriousbfg.com/success-is-relative-updated | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://notoriousbfg.com/success-is-relative-updated">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>In 2017, on a previous version of this blog, I wrote <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/success" target="_blank">Success</a>. Certainly at the time the conclusion I'd come to was revelatory for me. For years I'd help up these absolute examples of what I thought success was: starting a successful business; having a novel published; winning a prestigious sporting event. If you hadn't accomplished things in this order of magnitude, you weren't successful. In fact, I'd thought only a small proportion of people could truly consider themselves successful.</p><p>The realisation I came to at the time was that all forms of success are relative. There isn't one definition or "threshold" one must surpass to be successful; success pertains to the individual. Of course we can say that Usain Bolt is a successful athlete for breaking the world 100m record or that Warren Buffet is a successful businessman but these accomplishments are beyond the reach of the vast majority of mortals.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago on Hacker News I asked the question: "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24364817" target="_blank" title="Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24364817">Is it possible to be objectively good at something?</a>" I was really pleased with the range of really quite thoughtful responses I got back (and my question even touched the front page for a brief moment) but my favourite answer was this one from AnimalMuppet:</p><blockquote>
<p>"Objectively" means that someone should be able to unambiguously tell, without having to apply any judgment.</p>
<p>And yes, it's possible.  Am I objectively good at calculus?  I passed the AP test.  That's an objective measure.</p>
<p>But
 it's not that simple, for at least two reasons.  First, it's always 
possible to question the "objective measure".  Is the AP test a good 
test of whether someone is good at calculus?  AP says so, but that's not
 actually any help.  College admissions departments think so, too.  But 
grad school admissions people don't think so at all, and neither do math
 department hiring committees.  This shows the problem:  There is a 
measure that can objectively be met or failed, but is it the <i>right</i> measure?  How can you tell?  Not objectively.</p>
<p>Second, in many fields, there is no analog to the AP test.  Is Tolkein a good writer?  Is the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
 a good painting?  There is no clearly objective measure.  The only 
measure is that many people think so; more people than think, say, my 
daughter's watercolor is a good painting.  That's subjective, but at 
least it has the merit of being subjectively shared by many people.  And
 with something like <i>Mona Lisa</i>, it's shared by many people across
 many years - it's not just today's fad.  That's still subjective, but 
it's at least a subjectivity that has widespread agreement to it. <br></p>
</blockquote><p>It's a very comforting response because while they acknowledge that "there is no clearly objective measure", no test that can measure how "good" something or someone is (or that cannot be questioned), they also recognise that to be "good" is totally subjective. The closest thing to any kind of definitive measure of how good something we have is "the merit of being subjectively shared by many people."</p><p>I think it's very important to focus on the subjectivity of what is good. It would be dangerous of me here to confuse being "good" at something with success, to say that an individual's success depends on the
 number of people to have shared and agreed that what they've done is 
good, especially in this current age we live in. It's perfectly possible to be good at something but not be considered "successful". Take the footballer Phil Jones for example. Despite having one of the best clean sheet records in the Premier League, most fans would not consider Jones to be a success.<br></p><p>No, if success is subjective then it's an internal matter and hopefully this is the last time I'll ever need to write about it again.</p></div>

<p><span>The court also ordered the network owners including Bell, Rogers and others to pay costs of the appeal to TekSavvy Solutions Inc., which is the largest of Canada’s independent ISPs, and an industry association.</span></p><p><span>“This is a massive win for Canadians,” said Matt Stein, chair of the Canadian Network Operators Consortium (CNOC) and CEO of Distributel, one of about 30 CNOC members.</span></p><p><span>He said that the court’s decision ends a “pivotal chapter” in a fight that challenged “Canada’s longstanding practice of appropriate oversight to ensure fair pricing and competition.”</span></p><h3>TekSavvy refuses to pay more</h3><p><span>The court’s 3-0 ruling concluded by saying the award of costs to TekSavvy and CNOC reflects the fact that the appellants were not successful in convincing the three judges on any of the issues they raised.</span></p><p><span>There were several appeals before the court, including one filed by Bell Canada on behalf of BCE, and another for most of Canada’s largest cable operators, including Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor’s Videotron and Cogeco.</span></p><p><span>But the Federal Court of Appeal is only one way in which the big network owners have been fighting to prevent the CRTC from reducing the wholesale rates they charge to independent internet providers, which compete for some of the same customers.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday,&nbsp;TekSavvy Solutions Inc. said it’s owed tens of millions of dollars in rebates from excessive wholesale internet fees and won’t pay more to Bell or Rogers until the balance is settled.</p></div>

<p>Most energy suppliers nowadays offer green energy. In many if not most cases however, this does not mean what consumers would usually think it does and the choice for a green tariff often hardly helps create more renewable energy sources. The main reason for this is that the label ‘Green Energy’ is somewhat decoupled from the actual source of energy. In principle, this makes sense. If you generate green electricity from wind turbines in the North Sea, you cannot make sure it is this very electron that powers your oven in Munich. Rather, companies are allowed to calculate the net amount of energy they supply to the grid and sell that exact amount as ‘Green Energy’.  So far so good. The problem however, is that companies are not forced to reinvest their profits in more renewable energies. </p>



<h5>Internal Relabeling</h5>



<p>The first thing that happens is this: Imagine a German energy supplier that has offered roughly the same portfolio for the last twenty years. About 10% of that is renewable, the rest is coal, gas and nuclear. Having some investment in renewables was a sound investment even one or two decades ago, but back then hardly anyone cared for green electricity tariffs. The green energy was sold anyway as a natural part of that companies’ energy mix. Now imagine the same company now. They still have the exact same portfolio, but now green tariffs have become en vogue. The company can now market their 10% share of green energy to consumers as 100% green energy  and sell the exact same product at a higher price. And to a certain extent this is true: that share of their energy mix is indeed green energy. It just doesn’t mean that any new investments in green energy have happened. The only thing that changed is that other consumer of the same company now receive a lower share of renewables in their energy mix. A regular customer of that company had 10% green energy in his mix twenty years. Now the new green customers are being sold 100% green energy and the old consumers only have say 5% green energy in their mix. </p>



<h5>National and International Relabeling</h5>



<p>While that was bad, it is not the only form of relabeling that happens. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive created the so-called Guarantees of Origin GO. Those are certificates that validate that a certain amount (1MWh) of energy was generated from renewable sources. This is good. Companies are allowed to sell and buy these certificates. This is at least partly bad. The problem is not that those certificates are traded. The problem is that they are traded much too cheaply, at a price of around 0.02 cents per KWh. This means our German energy company with 10% renewable energies can go to a company in Norway and buy a whole lot of Guarantees of Origin. Norway has an amount of renewable energy sources that far exceeds their national demand for green energy tariffs. Companies therefore simply sell of their GOs to the German company that can now sell its coal energy (more than the 10% renewables they have!) as green electricity because they have bought certificates to greenwash their energy sources. Note that again that in the example no company has made any efforts to increase the amount of renewable energy produced. They have simply relabeled what had already existed. </p>



<h5>Solutions – Macrolevel</h5>



<p>The idea of trading certificates to create incentives for investment in green energy is good in principle. 0.02 cents a KWh just simply does not provide enough of an incentive to actually invest. The price is also going to stay low in the near future as the amount of green energy produced in some regions far exceeds the local demand for green electricity tariffs. This is bad as consumer demand rather reflects personal preferences and awareness of environmental issues than the social optimum. It also means that every investment in renewable energy makes it cheaper for others not to invest in green energy. While the supply of GOs stays high others can simply buy them instead of investing themselves. The solution I would propose on a macro level is either forcing energy suppliers to reinvest the surcharge over regular tariffs in renewables. Or it would be creating something like a minimum price for GOs, or better yet a tax for every MWh of non-green energy supplied. A tax on non-green energy sources would increase the demand and therefore the price of GOs and make new investments in green energy sources more attractive. </p>



<h5>Solutions – Microlevel</h5>



<p>There is also a couple of things individual consumers can do. If you care about green energy, have a thorough look at energy suppliers that actually <em>invest</em> in green energy sources, thereby increasing the supply of green energy. In Germany, those five suppliers are definitely trustworthy: </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>There is a common view that extracting text from a PDF document should not be too difficult. After all, the text is right there in front of our eyes and humans consume PDF content all the time with great success. Why would it be difficult to automatically extract the text data? </p><p>Turns out, much how <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">working with human names is difficult</a> due to numerous edge cases and incorrect assumptions, working with PDFs is difficult due to the extreme flexibility given by the PDF format.</p><p>The main problem is that PDF was never really designed as a data input format, but rather, it was designed as an output format giving fine grained control over the resulting document.</p><p>At its core, the PDF format consists of a stream of instructions describing how to draw on a page. In particular, text data isn’t stored as paragraphs - or even words - but as characters which are painted at certain locations on the page. As a result, most of the content semantics are lost when a text or word document is converted to PDF - all the implied text structure is converted into an almost amorphous soup of characters floating on pages.</p><p>As part of building <a href="https://www.filingdb.com/">FilingDB</a>, we’ve extracted text data from tens of thousands of PDF documents. In the process, we have seen how every single assumption we had about how PDF files are structured was proven incorrect. Our mission was particularly difficult as we had to process PDF documents coming from a variety of sources, with wildly different styling, typesetting and presentation choices.</p><p>The list below documents some of the ways PDF files have made it difficult (or even impossible) to extract text contents.</p><h2>PDF read protection</h2><p>You may have come across PDF files which refuse to let you copy their text content. For example, here is what SumatraPDF shows when attempting to copy text from a copy-protected document.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tCFgGsFAVfhZQqJx.png" alt="copy denied.png"></p><p>Interestingly, the text is already visible, yet the PDF viewer is refusing to populate the clipboard with the highlighted text.</p><p>The way this is implemented is by having several “access permissions” flags, one of which controls whether copying content is allowed. It’s important to keep in mind that this restriction is not enforced by the PDF file - the actual PDF contents are unaffected and it is up to the pdf renderer to honour this flag.</p><p>Needless to say, this offers no real protection against extracting the text out of the PDF, as any reasonably sophisticated PDF handling library will allow the user to either toggle the flags or ignore them.</p><h2>Off-page characters</h2><p>It is not uncommon for PDF files to contain more textual data than is actually displayed on the page. Take this page from the 2010 Nestle annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/rWwxfWHHBcjvZQul.png" alt="Nestle hidden text.png"></p><p>There is more text associated with this page than meets the eye. In particular, the following can be found in the content data associated with this page:</p><blockquote>“KitKat celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010 but remains young and in touch with trends, having over 2.5 million Facebook fans. It is sold in over 70 countries and enjoys good growth in the developed world and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, India and Russia. Japan is its second biggest market.”</blockquote><p>This text is actually positioned outside the page’s bounding box, so it is not displayed by most PDF viewers, but the data is there and will appear when programmatically extracting the text.</p><p>This occasionally happens due to last minute decisions to remove or replace text during the type setting process.</p><h2>Small / invisible characters on page</h2><p>PDFs occasionally introduce very small or hidden text on the page. For example, here is a page from the Nestle 2012 annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kqduhxcugDRKTbDC.png" alt="hidden characters.png"></p><p>The page contains small white text on white background with the following contents:</p><blockquote>​“Wyeth Nutrition logo Identity Guidance to markets</blockquote><blockquote>Vevey Octobre 2012 RCC/CI&amp;D”</blockquote><p>This is sometimes done for the benefit of accessibility, similar to how the alt attribute is used in HTML.</p><h2>​Too many spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs include extra spaces between letters in a word. This is most likely done for kerning purposes. (“Kerning” is the process of adjusting distances between characters during the type setting process)</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: the 2013 Hikma Pharma annual report contains the following text:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LNAUhbShXUkPbOhc.png" alt="an_excellent.PNG"></p><p>Copying the text gives:</p><blockquote>“ch a i r m a n ' s s tat em en t”</blockquote><p>Reconstructing the original text is a difficult problem to solve generally. Our most successful approach has been applying OCR techniques.</p><h2>Not enough spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs do not contain spaces or replace them with a different character.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: The following extract from the 2017 SEB annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/byRVQrWFscgwqUbM.png" alt="global trends.PNG"></p><p>The extracted text shows:</p><blockquote>“Tenyearsafterthefinancialcrisisstarted”</blockquote><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: The 2013 Eurobank annual report shows the following</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/cNjRRWVALUGfSnRl.png" alt="eurobank.PNG"></p><p>Extracting the text gives:</p><blockquote>“On_April_7,_2013,_the_competent_authorities”</blockquote><p>Again, our most successful solution was to run OCR on these pages.</p><h2>Embedded fonts</h2><p>PDF font handling is complex to say the least. To understand how PDF files store text data we must first know about glyphs, glyph names, fonts.</p><ul><li>A glyph is a set of instructions describing how to draw a symbol or character.</li><li>A glyph name is the name associated with that glyph. For example “trademark” for the “™” glyph and “a” for the “a” glyph.</li><li>Fonts are lists of glyphs with associated glyph names. For example, most fonts have a glyph that most humans would recognize as the letter “a”, with different fonts showing various ways of drawing that letter.</li></ul><p>In a PDF, the characters are stored as numbers, called “codepoints”. To decide what to draw on the screen, a renderer has to go:</p><p><code>codepoint -&gt; glyph name -&gt; glyph</code></p><p>For example, a PDF document can contain codepoint 116, which it maps into the glyph name “<code>t</code>” which, in turn, maps into the glyph describing how to draw “<code>t</code>” on the screen.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/boPNiRoKrNIlOHHD.png" alt="unicode glyphs.png"></p><p>Now, most PDF files use a standard codepoint encoding. A codepoint encoding is a set of rules that assign meaning to the codepoints themselves. For example:</p><ul><li>ASCII and Unicode both use codepoint 116 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”.</li><li>Unicode maps codepoint 9786 to “<code>white smiley face</code>”, rendered as ☺, whereas ASCII is not defined at that codepoint. </li></ul><p>However, PDF documents occasionally use their own custom encoding together with custom fonts. It might seem strange, but a document can use codepoint 1 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”. It will map codepoint 1 into the glyph name “<code>c1</code>”, which will map into a glyph describing how to draw the letter “<code>t</code>”.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/oLGIEmjOegjUtsiQ.png" alt="custom glyphs.png"></p><p>While for a human the end result looks the same, a machine will get confused by the codepoints it is seeing. If the codepoints do not follow a standard encoding, then it is virtually impossible to programmatically know what codepoints 1, 2 and 3 represent.</p><p>Why would a PDF document contain nonstandard fonts and encodings?</p><ul><li>One reason is to make text extraction more difficult.</li><li>Another is the use of subfonts. Most fonts contain glyphs for a very large number of codepoints and a pdf might only use a subset of these. To save space, a PDF creator can strip away all unneeded glyphs and create a compact subfont which will most likely use a non-standard encoding.</li></ul><p>One workaround is to extract the font glyphs from the document, run them through OCR software and build the map from font glyph to unicode. This then lets you translate from the font-specific encoding to the unicode encoding e.g: codepoint 1 is mapped to name “<code>c1</code>” which, based on looking at the glyph, should be a “<code>t</code>”, which is unicode codepoint 116.</p><p>The encoding map that you’ve just generated, the one going from 1 to 116, is called a ToUnicode map in the PDF standard. PDF documents can provide their own ToUnicode map, but it’s optional and many do not.</p><h2>Word and paragraph detection</h2><p>Reconstructing paragraphs and even words from the amorphous character soup of PDF files is a difficult task.</p><p>The PDF document provides a list of characters on a page and it is up to the consumer to identify words and paragraphs. Humans are naturally effective at doing this as reading is a widespread skill.</p><p>The common approach is to have a grouping or clustering algorithm which compares letter sizes, positions and alignments in order to determine what is a word/paragraph.</p><p>Naive implementations can easily have complexity larger than O(n²), resulting in long processing times on busy pages.</p><h2>Text and paragraph order</h2><p>Deciding on text and paragraph order is difficult on two levels.</p><p>First, sometimes there is no correct answer. While documents with conventional, single column typesetting have a natural order of reading, documents with more adventurous layouts are challenging. As an example, it is not clear if the following inset should appear before, after, or during the article it is placed next to:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tdNisrVDTpYeRiVU.png" alt="paragraph order.PNG"></p><p>Second, even when the answer is clear to a human, determining robust paragraph order is a very difficult problem to solve, perhaps even AI-hard. This might sound like an extreme statement, however there are cases where the correct paragraph order can only be decided by understanding the text content.</p><p>Consider the following two-columns layout, describing how to prepare a vegetable salad:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LVpxBZtdQdXIYMfv.png" alt="recipe.png"></p><p>In the western world, a reasonable assumption is that reading is done left to right and top to bottom. So the best we can do without looking at the contents is to reduce the answer to 2 options: A B C D and A C B D.</p><p>By looking at the content, understanding what it is talking about and knowing that vegetables are washed before chopping, we can determine that A C B D is the correct order. Determining this algorithmically is a difficult problem.</p><p>That being said, a “works most times” approach is to rely on the order in which the text is stored inside the PDF document. This usually corresponds to the order the text was inserted at creation time and, for large bodies of text containing multiple paragraphs, they tend to reflect the writer-intended order.</p><h2>Embedded images</h2><p>It is not uncommon for some (or all) of the PDF content to actually be a scan. In these cases, there is no text data to extract directly, so we have to resort to OCR techniques.</p><p>As an example, the Yell 2011 annual report is only available as a document scan:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kMKEqcgsWNHNhiXI.png" alt="scan.PNG"></p><h2>Why not OCR all …</h2></div></div></div></div>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><del>The Nokia 3310 3G is a</del> <em>Some versions</em> of the Nokia 3310 3G works as a descent podcast player, but you have to manage
your podcasts on a real computer.</p>
<h2>The story about why I bought candy bar feature phone in 2020</h2>
<p>Nokia 3310 3G is a feature phone with at least a design
heritage from the much loved Nokia 3310 of the late nineties.
A feature phone in 2020 is maybe not as strange as it might seem.
While the smart-phones are getting ever more advanced, there is also
a counter trend of digital decluttering.</p>
<p>I used to love my smartphone. I was on reddit (back when the mobile website worked)
and youtube all the time on my phone. I use it as a music player while I'm doing kitchen stuff.</p>
<p>But the main use was as a podcast player. Pre-corona I had a commute of
about an hour in each direction (bike + bus). I spent most of the bike time
with podcasts in my ear (the bus time was spent on hobby programming projects).</p>
<p>In January of 2020 I went on paternal leave and the podcast time picked up
significantly as I spent the days lugging around my sleeping then 7 months old boy
while walking the 8 months old lab. I would get about 10 hours of battery time out of
my phone, a 2016 model of Samsung A3. Now, clearly the battery had seen better
days. And it was never a high end phone to begin with. But 10 hours battery time
was getting to be a stress factor.</p>
<p>The thing is I sort of have to have a smartphone. Swish payments is one factor.
Most things that used to be actual currency transactions is Swish payments now.
Buy meat from the cattle farmer? Swish. Buy honey from the beekeeper? Swish. Buy socks
to support your coworkers kids soccer team? Swish. And Swish is available on phones only.
The chromebook that I use for mostly everything can run Android apps but the Swish app
refuses to install on a non phone device.</p>
<p>Another factor is BankID. BankID used to be only a bank issued smart card and a special
little card reader. You would stick the card into a slot in the reader and enter your pin
on the readers keypad. To log into you bank or to a government service you would get a 9 digit
code from the website that you would enter into the reader. The BankID reader would then display
a 6 digit answer code that you would enter into the website and the BankID system would then
guarantee your identity to the bank or government service. But then Mobile Bank Id showed up.
It's a smartphone app that does the same thing except the code-answer code exchange is done
automatically without user interaction now. And lots of websites are starting to retire
the old reader way identifying yourself, leaving Mobile BankID with the only option.</p>
<p>Being on paternal leave I did not have the money for a brand new smartphone, other than one
really low end one. It was also clear to me that it was the podcast consumption that was eating
up my battery. The days that I didn't listen to podcast I would get 24 hour of battery or more.
I'm not sure why podcasts in particular are so hard on the battery, it seemed that about equal
time on Spotify would not drain it nearly as much. I suspect that the fact that the podcast files
are stored on a external SD card has something to do with it.</p>
<p>I started looking at buying dedicated MP3 player. I know from buying an mp3 player for my oldest
daughter that the cheap ones are shit for podcasts and audio books. They reset the play list when
you turn them off and there is no way to have them turned on all the time. They power down when
taking a charge. San-disk still makes an mp3 player that are good for podcast and audio books.
"Resume function" is the keyword to look for. Roxcore also has one (I got one for my daughter when
the <em>really</em> cheap one turned our to be shit).</p>
<p>But then I saw the Nokia 3310 phones. At 600 SEK it's about the same price as a Roxcore mp3 player.
So I started to think I would get one and use it as an mp3 player <em>and</em> have it double as a backup
phone in case my smartphone had drained it's battery. But I was a bit hesitant, because I couldn't get
good information on weather the 3310 did the resume thing or not.</p>
<p>Eventually I bought one anyway. And I bought a 32 GB micro SD for it to store podcasts.
The 3310 has apps but no app store. You supposedly <em>can</em> download java apps for the Java Micro
framework or whatever its called and run them on the phone. But I haven't bothered. The phone has a
music player that picks up any mp3 file stored in the "Music" folder on the SD card, or the phone itself.
The music player really likes those mp3 tags for sorting the music by artist and albums, so it's not ideal
for podcasts. As a last ditch it sorts the files by name, so it kind of works out anyway. And yes, it does
"resume". Even if you exit the music player app it resumes where you stopped. And I get 4 to 5 days of battery
time even with rather heavy use. My old Samsung spends most of it's time in my bag now, and when not used, that
thing has pretty fantastic battery time too.</p>
<p>I use GPodder on windows to manage podcast downloads as the phone cant handle downloads.
It's pretty OK. I don't use the sync feature though, I just let it download everything,
and then I pick and choose what to transfer to the phone.</p>
<h2>Addendum</h2>
<p>I got a mail from <a href="http://ibawizard.net/">Jakub</a> where he wondered how I got the "resume" function
to work. He also has a 3310 (model of 2018), and apparently <em>his</em> phone does not resume anything,
but instead resets the player even on "stop". My phone has software version 30.0.0.17.03 (no build date), his phone
has software version V11.02.11, build date 2017-04-26. You can get the software version by dialing *#0000#
Since the version is completely differently formatted, I suspect that it's a different OS altogether.</p>
<p>So be careful I guess, some phones with earlier software may not work as a podcast player. My advice is do buy
from a bricks-and-mortar store and check the software version before you give them your money.</p>

<p>Jugaad is an attitude towards delivery which originated in India and consists of three simple tenets:</p>



<ul><li>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</li><li>Openness: keep your options open</li><li>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</li></ul>



<p>Jugaad is agility taken to the extreme and most suitable for projects with a high degree of change, risk and uncertainty. Nothing demonstrates the essence of jugaad better than the homonymous improvised vehicles built in India. All essential mechanical parts lay open and are easily accessible instead of being enclosed in casings. The vehicle can be assembled from commonly available, repurposed parts. It can be customised and extended to fit a variety of personal and professional needs, workloads and environments. The choice of parts can adapt the jugaad vehicle to different types of terrain, usage, fuel and availability of parts.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p>This post is not the result of studying literature, most of which seems to have been written around the peek of the jugaad hype in 2010. It rather distils the experience of a decade working with delivery teams in India, what I learned from their approach to delivery and from being immersed in Indian corporate culture. Through large parts of this post it may seem that I advocate the adoption of jugaad and the abolition of other agile methods; the opposite is true – I will try to make the point that the wholistic approach of jugaad to solution design should be paired with the tactical discipline of a framework like agile or XP.</p>



<h2>The tenets work together</h2>



<p>The three tenets (Humility, Openness, Frugality) complement and contradict each other in a beautiful way: Humility <em>generates</em> options for a solution, openness <em>guides</em> and <em>combines</em> them and frugality <em>eliminates</em> them. Only solutions adhering to all three tenets are built in the jugaad spirit.</p>

<h2>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</h2>



<p>Delivery methods like Waterfall, Scrum and XP wage religious wars over definitions (eg. what is the right sprint length?), processes (eg. degree of upfront planning), skills (eg. which framework should we use) and tools (eg. Maven or Gradle) all of which are more or less derivatives of adherence to a method. Jugaad replaces those definitions, processes, skills and tools with a central guidance: <em>be conscious about the shortcuts taken</em> with respect to the two other tenets. Jugaad frequently comes with a high degree of “out of the box” thinking and requires, for it to work, the humility to let go of technical and methodological preconceptions about what is the “appropriate” way and focus solely on the result.</p>



<p>Humility is the starting point in jugaad in that using “whatever works” generates a plethora of options. So how do we choose amongst these options? That is where Openness takes over.</p>



<h2>Openness: keep your options open</h2>



<p>The ostensible carelessness with which jugaad approaches delivery is built on the solid foundation of Openness. Whatever we build should be easy to extend, change or reverse. Openness often lacks elegance and conciseness, the inner workings of things are exposed, there is not much polish and one can see the parts a solution is made of – not to mention the security concerns arising from such solution. Just think of the jugaad vehicle we talked about earlier if you need a mental picture. But those trade-offs enable easily modifiable solutions and are exactly that: conscious trade-offs, not shortcomings. A solution which is open to change is a solid project or product foundation as it can adapt to unforeseen changes and doesn’t require much up-front design. Openness takes Humility’s options and guides them into coherent patterns. Not all options will form a good solution and not all combinations of options will work; Openness tells us which of them <em>might</em> work without losing an arm and a leg in the process of finding out.</p>



<h2>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</h2>



<p>Frugality is about risk management: reducing upfront costs <em>now </em>allows exploring more value propositions and solution approaches <em>now</em> while spending resources <em>later</em> on improving the solution. A low cost incurred early jeopardises a project less than a large cost incurred at the same time, especially if whatever that cost bought us turned out to be the wrong thing. Frugality is a holistic view on the patterns guided by Openness – it takes into consideration synergies between options and maximises value, both in terms of business value created for the solution (how many of the requirements were implemented at what effort) as well as value added to the project delivery (how much delivery and quality was improved, what was learned etc).</p>



<h2>Comparison by example</h2>



<p>Jugaad is illustrated best with a couple of examples which contrast traditional, “proper” design with improvised jugaad design.</p>



<h3>Example: receipt system</h3>



<p>Design a system that generates, stores and sends receipts via email to customers. Customer support should be able to retrieve receipts.</p>



<p>The traditional, “proper” solution:  we program a system that stores receipts in a relational database, generates receipt PDFs, stores those PDFs in the database, sends the PDFs to customers. We program a web interface for use by customer service which can query the database for receipts.</p>

<p>The jugaad-engineered solution: we program a system that generates HTML receipts, emails them to customers and BCCs a customer support email account with the same receipt. Customer support can use their email client to retrieve receipts. These components are either packaged and require no development effort (Customer support E-Mail client, E-Mail server), there a only few components and they are easy to implement.</p>

<p>Let’s evaluate the jugaad-engineered solution against jugaad’s tenets and compare it with the “traditional” solution.</p>



<p>Humility: the design relies on packaged components which probably already exist and it only minimally invades the existing IT landscape. It reuses high quality packaged solutions (e-mail server, e-mail client) which may already exist in the organisation and reduces implementation tasks to e-mail server and e-mail client configurations. The traditional delivery method places several requirements on how the solution is built: it mandates formal APIs, probably a particular technology platform, a pre-defined method according to which components are structured (eg. SOLID), technical documentation and thorough test automation long before it is clear that the project will make it into production, but nevertheless increasing conceptional and real complexity of the solution and the delivery process and requiring an increased skill set for project participants. </p>



<p>Openness: the e-mail protocols between the application, e-mail servers and e-mail clients are well understood and extensible. Using E-Mail clients requires low to no training and the IT department probably maintains them already. The components themselves can be substituted without affecting much the rest of the solution; eg. a new field can be added to future receipts without modifying already issued receipts. Because many components can be operated by human agents (the e-mail server and e-mail clients), many new features and workarounds can be implemented as manual processes before coding and automating them into software. Since not much effort has been put at the initial stage into upfront design there isn’t much effort wasted when requirements change and implementations follow.</p>



<p>Frugality: the use of packaged components, especially when they are already familiar, reduces implementation effort and speeds up delivery at the cost of the finished product showing incongruities where different components interface.  New requirements needing larger changes can be implemented by exchanging existing components for components better fitting the requirements or even rewriting them from scratch, if needed. In many cases the early progress made thanks to the low initial effort should more than make up for the higher, later cost. The traditional solution contrasts badly with jugaad in terms of effort. For example, it will mandate a particular API design such as a REST API for the receipt generator and receipt retrieval or even a REST API between the receipt generator and the email server, because… principles. Technical documentation will be written for the components long before it is clear that the project will ever go live, not considering that any effort spent on non-value adding features jeopardises a go-live. And last not least unit tests will be written to achieve an arbitrarily agreed upon test coverage before it is clear that they generate business value eg. by catching regressions. The jugaad-engineered solution will produce formal APIs, documentation and test automation when their added value outweighs the implementation effort.</p>



<h2>Contrast with agile</h2>



<p>Jugaad has no processes like Scrum or XP. It talks about the values worth striving for. It doesn’t talk about velocity or quality; even the focus on low cost introduces the discipline to achieving openness, thus being able to revisit a previously built solution. Agile highlights <em>reactiveness</em>, it’s main point being the ability to react to unforeseen changes, but it uses a predefined process such as Scrum or Kanban. The process must adapt to organisational changes or changing skill sets. Jugaad does not dictate any delivery process, so in a way it is orthogonal to existing agile practices. By adding formalised steps to it, a mature jugaad practice may evolve into Scrum or Kanban if that seems useful.</p>



<p>But jugaad is not about agile without …</p></div></div>

				<p>Don Starkell wasn't the kind of guy to shy away from improbable odds. So when people told him his dream of paddling a canoe from Winnipeg to the Amazon was impossible, it fuelled his determination to do it.
				</p>
				<p>The epic trip would stretch nearly 20,000 kilometres, through 13 countries, and would include life-threatening tropical storms, fierce waves and a near-execution in Honduras.</p>

				<p>“If we’d known what lay ahead,” Don wrote years later, “we certainly would not have gone.”</p>
				<p>Against all odds, Don and his son Dana would complete the trip in just under two years, setting a Guinness World Record for the longest canoe trip ever taken.</p>

<h2><span>Setting off</span></h2>
			<p>Don started talking about the canoe trip 10 years before it actually began.</p>
<p>During visits to a local library, Dana remembers him poring over the histories of people who had travelled portions of the proposed trek.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-longest-canoe-trip-ever">CBC Archives: The Longest Canoe Trip Ever</a></p>

<p>“It's just a matter of putting it together,” he remembered his father saying.</p>
<p>Don was already a seasoned — and decorated — canoeist. He'd been paddling since he was in his teens and was a member of the winning team in the 1967 Centennial Voyageur Canoe Pageant — a 104-day race that stretched from Rocky Mountain House, Alta., to Montreal.</p>

				</figure>

<p>The long trip was the perfect opportunity for Dana to hone his musical skills. He brought his guitar along to play when he wasn't paddling.</p>
<p>His younger brother, Jeff, wasn't so lucky; his passions — electronics and engineering — were less beach-friendly. He’d have to put his studies on hold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Starkell family pushed off from the beach on Winnipeg's Red River with Dana, 19, and Jeff, 18, in the <em>Orellana</em>, their custom-built fibreglass canoe, on June 1, 1980 — a Canadian flag proudly declaring their origins.</p>

				</figure>
<p>Most days, it went about like any other camping trip. Dana, being larger than Jeff, would sit at the front of the boat, with Jeff behind him and their father at the rear.</p>
<p>Don kept a journal throughout the trip. It would form the basis of his 1987 memoir, <em>Paddle to the Amazon.</em></p>
<p>“The Mississippi has been good to us, and we feel none of the resentment toward it that we felt toward the Red,” he wrote on July 31. “We do have our little hardships: warm drinking water, Mississippi sand in everything, and of course the heat.”</p>

				<h2><span>The pancake incident</span></h2>
				<p>Their travels through the U.S. waterways were mostly peaceful. But even though everything generally went well, after months on the water, tensions began developing among the trio.</p>
<p>Jeff recalled Dana and his dad scrapping over a single pancake that wasn’t split into perfectly even thirds.</p>

<p>“Dana grabbed the pancake, and then my dad kinda grabbed him in a big bear hug and smothered him down to the ground to kind of settle them down.”</p>				
<p>Don recorded other tense moments in his journal.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying so hard not to be bossy that we’ve now got three captains in the boat, each with a mind of his own. It’s a problem, and I’m going to have to be a little less democratic,” he wrote on Aug. 18.</p>
<p>“If I go too far, however, I’ll have a mutiny on my hands. I need my crew — need everything they can give me.”</p>

				<h2><span>‘D-Day’</span></h2>
				<p>In his journal, Don called Sept. 20, 1980 “D-Day,” when they planned to leave the protection of the Intracoastal Waterway near Port Isabel, Texas, and head out into the open sea, eventually crossing into Mexican waters.</p>
<p>Don assured his sons that as long as they followed his instructions, everything would be fine. The harsh currents resulting from the Waterway meeting the Gulf of Mexico had other ideas.</p>
<p>“Our first attempts to launch? I mean, it was a total disaster. We had no idea what we were doing,” Dana said.</p>

	<p>It took multiple attempts to make even minor headway without their canoe getting filled with water. Eventually, they realized they just had to paddle forward and that getting semi-swamped was just part of the process.</p>

<p>Rough waters made the next steps even more difficult. On Sept. 30, Don wrote in his journal that after 10 days of fighting the relentless currents, they managed to progress little more than three kilometres.</p>
<p>Things got worse when they hit the Laguna Madre, a long stretch of water that runs inland along Mexico’s coast. Jeff recalls they entered it at a double — both daily and monthly — high tide. They thought it was enough to take them down the coast, but it soon dried up.</p>
<p>“The next thing you know, we’re in the middle of this lagoon, a mile on either side of us mud,” Dana recalled.</p>

<p>By February 1981, the Gulf had calmed enough for Don and Dana set off again — with nearly 14,000 kilometres left to go.</p>
<p>After crossing from Mexico into Belize, they enjoyed a peaceful stretch along the Colson Cays in Belize. But that calmness was violently shattered by tropical storm Arlene, which barrelled down on them just as they took shelter in a fishing shack.</p>

<p>All night, the wind and waves tore at the flimsy plywood walls of the shack. Don and Dana were certain it would be ripped from its moorings and they would be flung out to sea.</p>
<p>But somehow they survived the night. Even more surprising, so did their canoe. Don had tied it to posts driven into the sharp coral bank the night before. Incredibly, it suffered no damage.</p>

			<p>On May 24, with their water supplies dwindling, Don and Dana stumbled on a small coconut plantation on the Laguna de Caratasca, which runs just inside the Honduran coastline.</p>
<p>Upon pulling into shore, they struck up a conversation with two women who agreed to cook them some food.</p>
<p>Don was filling their canteens with fresh coconut water when two men approached them — one of them brandishing a shotgun.</p>
<p>"They walk right up to us and the guy levels this shotgun at us, raises it slightly overhead, blows it off just to show us they weren't fooling around and then ordered us down to our canoe," Dana said.</p>

<p>The rogue soldiers ransacked the canoe, then ordered Don and Dana to start marching.</p>

<p>“At that stage of the trip, my dad is thinking like, you know, we're not getting out of this. These guys are going to kill us.”</p>
<p>Eventually, the men dropped Don and Dana off at a military base, leaving the duo puzzled over why their lives were spared.</p>
<p>The next morning, just before they were released and returned to their canoe, the women they had met earlier showed up in tears at the military base.</p>
<p>“It was those two ladies that we met that saved us. They told [one of the soldiers] that if they killed us, they were going to report him. And those guys could have turned around and put bullets through their heads,” Dana explained. “Just as easy.”</p>

			<p>Nearly a year after leaving Winnipeg, Don and Dana had paddled through six countries — Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras — with seven still to go: Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago and finally Brazil.</p>




<p>Sometimes, Dana was able to break the ice with strangers in towns along the way by playing his guitar.</p>
<p>But other times, Dana and his father adopted a “survival mode,” growing into their now-haggard appearances to scare off would-be aggressors.</p>

<p>“The way we thought at the time was just to kind of look at somebody in such a way to say to them: If they bothered us, we would kill 'em,” Dana said.</p>
<p>By Dana’s recollection, they had at least 13 encounters with people who threatened them at gunpoint. But nothing came as close to disaster as the Honduras incident.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>At my workplace we are using lots of distribution lists in O365 to move information around. Because of this, in some departments, the employees can be part of many DL's. During onboarding this is annoying as it's not very easy to track those.</p>
<p>Lucky me that O365 has a very good PowerShell integration. 
In this article I will teach you how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare your powershell to run scripts</li>
<li>Connect to O365 Exchange Online via PowerShell</li>
<li>Copy DL membership from an existing user to another</li>
<li>Disconnect from O365 Exchange Online</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-powershell-execution-policy">1. PowerShell Execution Policy</h2>
<p>The PowerShell Execution Policy is part of the PowerShell security. It dictates whether you can load config files, run scripts or if those scripts must be digitally signed before you can run them.</p>
<p>I will not get into explaining the execution policies or the scope of them here. If you want to learn more about that you can do it <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7">here</a>.</p>
<p>What we need to do here is to set our execution policy as <strong>RemoteSigned</strong>. This will allow us to run scripts.</p>
<p>To set this policy you need to open a PowerShell as an administrator </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599993569545/XiU7KDYL9.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screenshot 2020-09-11 at 20.25.28.png"></p>
<p>and run the following command</p>
<pre><code><span>Set</span>-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -<span>force</span>
</code></pre><p>You can now check that the policy used for your <strong>LocalMachine</strong> scope is <strong>RemoteSigned</strong> by running:</p>
<pre><code>Get-ExecutionPolicy -<span>List</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599931264557/do5xE2MME.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Screenshot 2020-09-11 at 20.26.09.png"></p>
<p>You will now be able to connect to O365 with Powershell.</p>
<h2 id="2-connect-to-o365-echange-online-via-powershell">2. Connect to O365 Echange Online via PowerShell</h2>
<p>The process to connect from PowerShell to O365 Echange Online is pretty straightforward. </p>
<ol>
<li>Open PoweShell</li>
<li><p>Store your credentials in a variable: </p>
<pre><code><span>$Cred</span> = Get-Credential
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Enter your username and password in the prompt.</p>
</li>
<li>Type the following command:  <pre><code>$Session = <span>New</span>-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https:
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Import your session: </p>
<pre><code>Import-PSSession <span>$Session</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now you can run any commands you need. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-copy-dl-membership-from-an-existing-user-to-another">3. Copy DL membership from an existing user to another</h2>
<p>Adjust the following code snippet and run it:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace <strong><a href="mailto:developer-role@example.com" target="_blank">developer-role@example.com</a></strong> with the email from which you want to copy the DL's</li>
<li>replace <strong><a href="mailto:new-user@example.com" target="_blank">new-user@example.com</a></strong> with the email to which you want to copy the DL's</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$dists= Get-DistributionGroup
$sourceMailbox = Get-Mailbox <span>'developer-role@example.com'</span>

<span>foreach</span>($dist in $dists){
    $gms = Get-DistributionGroupMember -identity $dist.Identity
    <span>foreach</span> ($gm in $gms){
       <span>if</span> ($gm.name -eq $sourceMailbox.name){
          <span>write</span>-host <span>'User Found In Group'</span>   $dist.Alias
          Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity $dist.Alias -Member <span>"new-user@example.com"</span>
       }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>This snippet will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate through all distribution groups in your organisation</li>
<li>on each iteration it will check if $sourceMailbox is part of that list</li>
<li>if it is, it will also add the new mailbox to that list</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-disconnect-from-o365-exchange-online">4. Disconnect from O365 Exchange Online</h2>
<p>Disconnecting from your session is as simple as typing: </p>
<pre><code>Remove-PSSession <span>$Session</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>You can access the complete  <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/hashtag-gakusei/73fdfa5f6eb880012062880e5f8950af">script on GitHub</a>.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I cannot create, I do not understand. ― Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As multi-account AWS architectures have become more common, there has also been a need to implement centralized user and access management. The AWS solution to this problem is AWS SSO, which is indeed a neat solution, but …</p>
<p>Many popular developer tools, including AWS’ own CDK (Cloud Development Kit) and Amplify, do not support it yet, as we can find from the GitHub issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5455">AWS SSO Named Profiles Support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/4488">Problem using CLI via AWS SSO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, the best answer to these problems can be found on Twitter, so also this time. <a href="https://twitter.com/nikovirtala/status/1304308556083200006">I complained about the issue</a>, and very soon, I had the best solution so far in my hands!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe">Ben Kehoe</a> has written two nice helper tools to go around the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-credential-process">benkehoe/aws-sso-credential-process</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-export-credentials">benkehoe/aws-export-credentials</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared">Jared Short</a> came up with a little helper function, which will nicely tie the whole process together.</p>
<p>So, what do I need to do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the two tools; <a href="https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-sso-credential-process">aws-sso-credential-process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benkehoe/aws-export-credentials">aws-export-credentials</a></li>
<li>Place following to your <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshrc</code> or similar: <em>– Don’t forget to replace the start URL and region values.</em></li>
</ol>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>AWS_CONFIGURE_SSO_DEFAULT_SSO_START_URL</span><span>=</span>https://<span>&lt;</span>your-sso<span>&gt;</span>.awsapps.com/start
<span>export</span> <span>AWS_CONFIGURE_SSO_DEFAULT_SSO_REGION</span><span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>your-default-region<span>&gt;</span>

<span>sso</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
  <span>unset</span> AWS_PROFILE
  <span>export</span> <span>AWS_PROFILE</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>
  aws sts get-caller-identity <span>&amp;&gt;</span> /dev/null <span>\</span>
  <span>||</span> aws sso login <span>\</span>
  <span>||</span> <span>(</span>unset AWS_PROFILE <span>&amp;&amp;</span> aws-configure-sso-profile --profile<span>)</span>
  <span>eval</span> <span><span>$(</span>aws-export-credentials --env-export<span>)</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Source your profile, run <code>sso</code>, and off you go! – The helper tools will configure your shell with credentials that most of the tools can understand, even they wouldn’t support AWS SSO yet.</li>

We need to know the status of our Github Actions specifically when they fail so that our development team can act upon them as quickly as possible.</p><p>We faced this issue often at our workspace.

September 13, 2020 | https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-build-an-sre-team | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-build-an-sre-team">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you implement SRE practices and culture at your organization, you’ll realize everyone has a part to play. From engineers setting SLOs, to management upholding the virtue of blamelessness, to marketing teams conducting retrospectives on email campaigns, there’s no part of an organization that doesn’t benefit from the SRE mentality.<br></p><p>However, while it’s not necessarily to have people with the title of ‘SRE’ in order to successfully adopt the best practices of SRE, having people who are dedicated to stewardship of SRE practices is important to achieve reliability excellence. In this blog post, we’ll look at some of the many roles an SRE can play, and how to find people with those skill sets.</p><h3>Common pathways to becoming an SRE</h3><p>When looking for people to fill your SRE team, looking only for self-described SREs may be too limited in scope. People from a wide variety of backgrounds can learn the tenets of SRE while also benefiting from their unique expertise. Here are some examples of career paths that could make people a great fit for SRE:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Software developers </strong>understand the value of reliability metrics and are accustomed to solving optimization problems based around them</li><li><strong>System administrators </strong>take a holistic perspective to entire system architecture and proactively address reliability issues, such as potential downtime</li><li><strong>System design engineers </strong>create efficient procedures through complex systems, helpful for coming up with runbooks and other incident responses</li><li><strong>Quality assurance engineers </strong>have a test-oriented mindset, ensuring that systems stay reliable in the most adverse conditions</li><li><strong>Database administrators </strong>are accustomed to optimizing the storage and reliability of huge data systems, making them well suited for the challenges of reliably scaling<br></li></ul><p>Although SREs commonly emerge from other tech disciplines, the mindset of SRE can be appreciated and embraced by anyone. SREs can emerge from backgrounds as diverse as communications, business studies, and the arts. By looking at their own challenges of reliability through the lens of SRE, they can contribute unique insights.</p><h3>SREs as engineers of reliability</h3><p>SRE is a holistic discipline that involves many skills outside of writing code. Nevertheless, a major role your SREs will play is that of a software engineer, building systems and software to improve reliability. Ensure that your prospective SREs understand the languages and architecture of your systems. Even if they aren’t writing much code, they need to understand how development decisions impact systems.<br></p><p>SREs can work with development teams to “develop for reliability.” This involves considering how development will impact key reliability metrics, measured by <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs and error budgets</a>. As these metrics reflect the most fundamental levels of coding and architecture configuration. To work with them, SREs will have to understand how potential development directions will impact the entire stack, from top to bottom.</p><p>Because of this “big picture” approach to development, looking for SREs with a strong systems engineering background can be helpful. In “<a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/june15/hiring-site-reliability-engineers">Hiring Site Reliability Engineers</a>” for <em>login</em>, the USENIX magazine, Google employees Chris Jones, Todd Underwood, and Shylaja Nukala detail their technical hiring process for SREs. They break down how <strong>SREs with the ability to form connections throughout complex systems can make up for missing expertise of the specific software systems.</strong> Through a combination of holistic systems analysis and detailed examination of ramifications in the lowest level of code, SREs can fully understand the relationship between development and reliability.</p><blockquote> <strong>SREs with the ability to form connections throughout complex systems can make up for missing expertise of the specific software systems.</strong></blockquote><h3>SREs as stewards of reliability</h3><p>At the heart of decision-making is data. Without complete and accurate data about how your system operates, it’s impossible to know where to prioritize development efforts. Another key role of SREs is collecting, refining, and analyzing this data. There are many <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">monitoring tools</a> available that can help extract and visualize data from your system. SREs can transform this data into something actionable.<br></p><p>A key example of this transformation is creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a>. SLIs combine low-level monitoring data into a single metric that reflects business impact, which is then used to set SLOs. SLIs and SLOs should be determined and reviewed by large teams of people, but SREs can be a bridge of knowledge for those teams. SREs can connect different domains of technical and business expertise to find the most impactful indicators and guardrails of reliability.<br></p><p>Monitoring data and indicators built from it, like SLOs, should be readily accessible and comprehensible to your entire team, but SREs will have a special relationship with it. Acting as the stewards of reliability, they advocate for maintaining SLOs and other best practices to shift quality left so teams can scale sustainably When hiring SREs for this role, don’t just look for expertise in your particular monitoring or other tools, as your tech stack tomorrow will look different than the one today. Instead, look for people who understand the importance of putting data in the right context, and how to persuade others to adopt best practices.&nbsp;</p><h3>SREs as leaders who align reliability with business needs</h3><p>As you develop your SRE solution, you’ll find yourself building up a framework of policies and practices: review and revision cycles, ownership maps, incident classifications and response procedures, and more. These should be understood, agreed upon, and adopted by the entire team, but SREs can serve as leaders for fine tuning and keeping this framework operating. SREs can help develop and implement procedures in many areas of SRE, including:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>SLO and error budget review</li><li>Incident classification review</li><li>Runbook creation and review</li><li>Incident retrospective practices</li><li>On-call scheduling policies</li><li>Security audits</li><li>Chaos engineering test procedures<br></li></ul><p>For each of these categories, all stakeholders should be consulted. SREs serve as a holistic bridge between their domain expertise and the greater impact on reliability metrics for the entire business.<br></p><p>Once policies are in place, SREs can take the lead on ensuring they’re followed. As “reliability educators,” SREs can conduct internal audits to make sure incident retrospectives contain the necessary data, that follow-up tasks are being completed, that runbooks are having scheduled updates, etc. Of course, these audits would be conducted blamelessly—in socio-technical systems, if certain procedures aren’t being upheld, it isn’t the fault of the individuals not following them, but likely how the procedures themselves have been set.<br></p><p>SREs in this role don’t need to be experts on every category listed above, although some familiarity is necessary. Each team’s adoption of best practices will be unique, and teams should embrace <a href="https://pulseasync.com/operators/future-remote-working/">context over control</a> so team members are empowered to make the best decisions they can in dynamic situations. Most importantly, SREs need a collaborative attitude and a willingness to consider the concerns of others. Ask prospective SREs how they’d handle disagreement in how a policy should be developed, or an incident where people were found to be negligent in following policy. Understanding their attitude in such situations can be just as useful as their technical expertise.</p><h3>SREs as ambassadors of reliability culture</h3><p>SREs should embody the cultural lessons of SRE in every role they play. Decisions they make around policy or development should always reflect these values—not just implicitly, but as a stated element of their decision-making process. That means fostering an environment of empathy, ownership, and trust.<br></p><p>It can be difficult to determine how a prospective hire will align to these cultural values. These beliefs are unlikely to show up on someone’s resume or transcript. To start diving deeper into their attitudes, here are some questions to consider when evaluating a prospective SRE:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>How do they approach reliability goal setting?</li><li>What value do they place on failure?</li><li>How do they work to attribute error without blame?</li><li>What about incident retrospectives do they find most valuable?</li><li>How do they approach situations where others may come to them with concerns about teams, reliability, or other subjects?<br></li></ul><p>Try asking about hypothetical situations where these beliefs would be tested. Ask them to explain the values behind their decisions, then probe even further, asking why these values are beneficial to the team. Experienced SREs should be able to connect policies with cultural and business outcomes, and advocate for healthy reliability practices. For example, they’ll be able to connect the dots between investments in things like SLOs, documentation, and toil automation, and how they ultimately lead to shared context and improved morale.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Common team structures</h3><p>As you start an SRE team, where your SRE team sits in context of the rest of your engineering organization will depend on your organization's operational maturity, culture, and needs. Here are a few of the common structures:<br></p><p><strong>SRE model with dedicated engineers focused on infrastructure and/or tooling (shared services, observability, etc.)</strong></p><p>This configuration has the SRE team reinforcing efforts across the organization. They maintain services used by many different development teams without focusing on any specific project. With this configuration, the productivity and reliability of many projects can be improved at once. However, there may not be the resources to address specific reliability needs.<br></p><p><strong>Embedded SRE model where full time SREs are assigned to a product/service</strong></p><p>In this configuration, each product or service team is assigned some number of SREs to address their specific reliability requirements. This allows greater flexibility in allocating SRE resources—you can focus on areas with the biggest business impact. Embedded SREs should still take care to communicate to maintain …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>James A. Bashford and colleagues <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425399/"><strong>aimed to identify a novel quantitative biomarker related to fasciculations</strong></a> that could monitor patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis over time.</p>

<p>Fasciculations are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Their presence precedes the onset of muscle weakness. However benign fasciculation syndrome is not considered a prodrome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p>The authors have recently developed Surface Potential Quantification Engine (SPiQE), which is an automated analytical tool designed to detect and characterize fasciculation potentials from resting high-density surface electromyography. SPiQE is capable of analysing 30-min recordings, producing simple outputs related to fasciculation frequency, amplitude, inter-fasciculation intervals and data quality. SPiQE’s analytical pipeline achieved a classification accuracy of 88% when applied to 5318 fasciculation potentials that had been identified manually.</p>

<p><img src="https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/img/Hand_Motor_Units_web.jpg" width="400">
<em>Source: <a href="https://backyardbrains.com/">https://backyardbrains.com/</a></em></p>

<p>A motor unit comprises the motor neuron cell body, axon, terminal branches and connecting muscle fibres. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis leads to a process called chronic partial denervation. This means that as motor units succumb to the disease and die, surviving motor units are instructed to sprout and branch to reinnervate orphaned muscles fibres.</p>

<p>This is an evolutionary, compensatory mechanism designed to maintain muscle power in the face of a reduced motor unit pool. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a reinnervating motor unit steadily acquires new muscle fibres and consequently produces motor unit action potentials of larger amplitude, longer duration and greater complexity.</p>

<p>However, due to the relentless loss of motor units in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, this process of reinnervation cannot maintain muscle strength indefinitely. A saturation point is reached and muscle fibres consequently atrophy, leading swiftly to clinical weakness. By assessing fasciculation amplitude serially as a surrogate of this reinnervation process, the scientists hoped to gain insight into this process.</p>

<p>It had been suggested that motor unit firing pattern is evidence for motoneuronal or axonal fasciculations; namely interspike intervals of approximately 5&nbsp;ms (doublet intervals) provide evidence for the axonal firing. Fasciculation doublets have been shown to occur in biceps brachii, vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as the gastrocnemius (along with the soleus muscle, the gastrocnemius forms half of the calf muscle) from both patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign fasciculation syndrome.</p>

<p>Fasciculation doublets are defined as the occurrence of two almost identical motor unit potentials, presumed to both arise from the same motor unit, with a very short IFI of &lt;100 ms. Shorter inter-fasciculation intervals (5–10 ms) are likely to arise distally in the terminal branches, whereas longer inter-fasciculation intervals (40–80 ms) are thought to originate proximally at the soma.</p>

<p>Faced with the low occurrence rate of doublets during electrical stimulation, the scientists hypothesized that collection of vast numbers of fasciculations would be required to observe IFI peaks in these ranges. In turn, this might help to elucidate the origin of fasciculations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p>So in this study, Bashford and colleagues compared amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with control subjects who have benign fasciculation syndrome, a condition that is defined by the isolated presence of fasciculations, particularly in muscles of the lower limbs, without evidence of underlying motor neuron degeneration</p>

<p>Twenty patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and five patients with benign fasciculation syndrome each underwent up to seven assessments at intervals of 2 months 
A total of 420 (210 biceps, 210 gastrocnemius) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 116 (58 biceps, 58 gastrocnemius) benign fasciculation syndrome recordings were analyzed. Ten biceps recordings from two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were excluded due to contamination from a Parkinsonian resting tremor</p>

<p>The scientists tested whether the presence of muscle weakness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis influenced the change in fasciculation frequency over time. The scientists divided the data into strong and weak muscles. The scientists divided each muscle into pre-weakness, peri-weakness and post-weakness groups. This allowed them to assess the chronology of disease by equating these groups to early, middle and late stages of disease, respectively. This was only possible due to the anatomical specificity of the high-density surface electromyography technique, which is a major strength in this setting.</p>

<p>For biceps, fasciculation frequency in strong amyotrophic lateral sclerosis muscles was 10× greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline, while fasciculation frequency in weak muscles started at levels 40× greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline. Over the 14 months of the study, fasciculation frequency decreased in weak muscles at a rate three times faster than average. This supported the suspicion of the authors that biceps fasciculation frequency was non-linear, first rising steadily from a pre-morbid baseline in strong muscles and subsequently falling as weakness ensued.</p>

<p>Given that there was no significant change in biceps fasciculation frequency over the 14 months of the study in strong amyotrophic lateral sclerosis muscles, Bashford and colleagues hypothesize that the rising phase is slow, perhaps starting many years before clinical weakness. In contrast to biceps, gastrocnemius demonstrated a significant decline in fasciculation frequency in strong muscles, but plateaued in weak muscles.</p>

<p>The most striking implication from these results was the rise and subsequent fall of fasciculation frequency in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis biceps muscles. This non-linear pattern had been previously suggested after statistically modelling fasciculation counts using muscle ultrasound and might explain why a previous surface EMG study of fasciculation frequency did not show a significant linear change over time.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesize that the two main contributing factors to fasciculation frequency are the size of the affected motor unit pool and the relative degree of hyperexcitability. The size of the viable motor unit pool declines over time in biceps muscles, even while muscles remained strong (albeit at a slower rate than weak muscles). 
However, it remains unknown what proportion of motor units are affected (and therefore hyperexcitable) at a given stage of the disease.</p>

<p>The decline in fasciculation frequency can be attributed to the relentlessly shrinking motor unit pool. The picture above highlight the proposed model of the interactions between muscle power, size of viable motor unit pool (as assessed by MUNIX) and fasciculation frequency in benign fasciculation syndrome and three stages of disease in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7425399/bin/EMS94304-f006.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>The diagrams depict the dynamic changes in motor unit architecture and relative hyperexcitability (depicted by electric bolts) as a consequence of motor neuron degeneration and motor unit loss.</p>

<p>In benign fasciculation syndrome, there is global hyperexcitability affecting all motor units to a similar degree in the absence of motor neuron degeneration.</p>

<p>In early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a subset of motor units are hyperexcitable, motor unit loss has begun and mild–moderate compensatory reinnervation has occurred. Due to the stability of biceps fasciculation frequency in strong muscles over 14 months (at a firing rate ~10 greater than the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline), the rising phase is hypothesized to begin many years before muscle weakness first appears.</p>

<p>It is postulated that towards the latter end of the rising phase, the rate of increase in fasciculation frequency speeds up, so that by the onset of weakness, fasciculation frequency is ~40 the benign fasciculation syndrome baseline.</p>

<p>In the middle stage, the ongoing loss of motor units has promoted extensive re-innervation of surviving motor units, which then become hyperexcitable themselves. This compensatory mechanism leads to fasciculations of greater amplitude and allows muscles to remain strong by staving off muscular atrophy.</p>

<p>However, as a tipping point is reached, these compensatory mechanisms saturate, leading to the onset of muscle atrophy and weakness.</p>

<p>In late amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the death of the most re-innervated motor units leads to worsening muscle atrophy and weakness. The relentless loss of motor units drives the falling fasciculation frequency. Evidence of doublets with inter-fasciculation intervals in the 20–80 ms range is consistent with the period of motor unit subtypes (fast-slow), supporting a proximal origin of fasciculations at the soma. Throughout all stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in benign fasciculation syndrome, the degree of hyperexcitability of the lower motor neuron is likely to be driven and/or influenced by descending corticospinal inputs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Management should not be the only option for engineering advancement, or even the default one. So how can we support our leading engineers to follow the career path that they truly want?</p><div>
<div>
<div> <p>Great managers make great teams, and organisations are rightfully eager to find engineers with manager potential. But management should not be the default career path for engineers. Many of the "leadership" skills that make for good managers (e.g. setting a clear direction, caring about other humans, understanding the business, building consensus, communicating ideas) are also the ones that make&nbsp;<em>stellar</em>&nbsp;senior, staff, and principal engineers. If we require these skills at senior engineering levels, we'll boost our ability to complete difficult projects, make better technical decisions, and bring up the skill level of our whole engineering organisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While career progression for a software engineer often involves management, many companies provide a parallel 'technical track': a job ladder for engineers who want to continue to focus on their technical skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variants of this career path, but a common one is a&nbsp;<em>senior engineer</em>&nbsp;getting promoted to&nbsp;<em>staff engineer,&nbsp;</em>and then to&nbsp;<em>principal engineer</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as on the management track, seniority on the technical track reflects the&nbsp;<em>impact&nbsp;</em>of the role i.e. how much more successful they made the engineering team or the business as a whole. However unlike the management track, this impact is usually achieved without direct authority. While some folks do straddle the line between engineer and manager, staff and principal engineers typically don't have a team of reports who can be deployed to solve problems. This doesn't mean that they work alone though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The technical track is often called the 'individual contributor' track, but few senior engineers should be true individual contributors. Most should be responsible for clear improvement across their team or organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This improvement comes from creating compelling&nbsp;<strong>technical strategy</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>executing on projects</strong>&nbsp;that wouldn't have succeeded otherwise, and&nbsp;<strong>influencing other engineers</strong>&nbsp;to do their best work. I believe that these three axes are how we can describe success for senior roles on the technical track.</p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>It's easy for software engineers to focus on immediate problems. Our most senior engineers should be able to see beyond those immediate needs and prepare for future needs too. By staff level, an engineer should be planning at least a year ahead: understanding how technical changes now (or staying with the status quo) will affect the team then. This means always having a ton of technical, business and industry context, and using that knowledge to predict risks, opportunities, scaling cliffs, and so on. When the way forward is too ambiguous, they should notice which decisions are being avoided and either chase down consensus or make a compelling case for a particular technical direction.</p>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>Our senior engineers most likely got to their role because they're skilled at executing and completing projects. By staff level, they should be able to lead projects that are too broad, ambiguous or contentious for most engineers to tackle. Engineers leading these projects will use a mix of technical and organisational skills. They need to have enough time and mental bandwidth to dig into the details and make big decisions, enough self-confidence to ask the 'obvious' questions that will shake out misunderstandings, and enough organisational clout to influence the technical direction of multiple teams without stomping on their autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Good influence</h2>
<p>We learn from our own mistakes and successes, but each of us only has a finite number of our own projects to reflect on. We need to learn from each other's mistakes and successes too. Our most senior engineers have&nbsp;<em>seen some things&nbsp;</em>and likely broken some things too, and those experiences shouldn't go to waste. Staff engineers can set explicit standards for their organisations, for example by creating guidelines and best practices, by leaving thoughtful comments on code and documents, and by having a high bar for what gets deployed. But they also set implicit cultural norms through their own output. Managers can bang the drum for quality, but if the most senior engineers don't write tests then you'll never convince the juniors to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These three aspects of a stellar senior engineer (strategy, execution and good influence) all need skills that we often recognise as "management" material. The good strategic ideas, the project solutions and the thorough reviews will carry little weight if they're not communicated clearly or if nobody is convinced to follow them. Without the ability to build consensus across teams, we'll choose solutions that may be optimal inside a single team but don't interoperate well, or that duplicate effort. Without business context, engineers will make flawed technical decisions or will waste their time working on something with little value. Without empathy for other humans, review comments may reduce the confidence of junior engineers instead of boosting their skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course all this work needs technical depth and technical judgement too. We want our strategies to be sound, our project solutions to actually solve the problems, and our review comments to make code and designs better. But technical knowledge is not enough on its own. Impact at this level means being a force multiplier.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not just for extroverts</h2>
<p>I want to be clear that I'm not saying all staff and principal engineers need to be "people people". Influence doesn't have to be loud or extroverted. Leadership can come from designing "happy path" solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes. It can come from reviewing other engineers' code and designs in a way that improves their confidence and skills, or highlighting design proposals that don't have a genuine business need. I've seen excellent staff engineers who would never describe themselves as leaders but who raise everyone's game as they quietly set the direction for their technical area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible for engineers who prefer to work alone to still make the organisation better through their judgement and good influence. There are a lot of ways to have impact. But contrast those folks with senior engineers who make the people around them&nbsp;<em>worse</em>. No matter what their output is, it's hard to imagine how they can have enough impact to compensate for the reduced output and growth of other engineers, the effects on employee retention, and the projects that will fail as a result of their unwillingness to collaborate across teams.&nbsp; We set ourselves up to fail if we promote this kind of engineer to a level where they'll be seen as an exemplar.</p>

<p>If we recognise the need for leadership attributes in our most senior engineers, we should cultivate those skills. That means hiring and promoting for the skills we want, finding engineers opportunities where they can lead, and reducing the emphasis on management as the only career path.</p>
<h2>Don't promote for code output</h2>
<p>No matter what leaders describe as the company culture, the skills that are shown to be valued are the ones that are getting people hired and promoted. We need to require strategy, execution and good influence from our senior engineers. If we promote a staff engineer who churns out code but can't work with other people, that becomes the implicit definition of a staff engineer. On the other hand, if our most senior engineers are modelling leadership skills and making everyone better, we're setting up a virtuous cycle. Mid-level engineers will strive to emulate the same behaviour, and leadership skills will grow throughout the org.</p>
<h2>Every project, every initiative and every crisis is an opportunity</h2>
<p>Every cross-team project or messy ambiguous problem is a training opportunity to bring an engineer up a level. While we will sometimes want to deploy our reliable heavy hitters on a project that can’t afford to fail, we should take every opportunity to invite another engineer to try leading a project that's slightly too big for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they're set up for success through mentoring, coaching and lots of support, we'll build the next generation of heavy hitters. The vast majority of our learning happens on the job, so long as we make sure the learning opportunities are available.</p>
<h2>Management is a lateral move</h2>
<p>Management is a&nbsp;<em>different job</em>&nbsp;from engineering. Though on my earlier diagram of an engineering job ladder it is a clear step up, we shouldn't be treating it as a promotion. It should be considered a lateral move to another role. Thinking of management as the obvious "next step up" treats it as a prize to be won, rather than a skill to be honed. The best managers I know are the ones who want to be great managers, not the ones who merely want to climb a rung on their career ladder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our technical track ladder should be a genuine parallel path to our management ladder, with the same status and recognition, and it should be explicit about the leadership skills and business context needed at each level.&nbsp; Moving back and forth between tracks should be normal and encouraged. Skills built on either side will be valuable on the other.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>We'll always need excellent managers and it's great to encourage engineers to manage if that's what they're drawn to. However, it shouldn't be the default career path.</p>
<p>When we push our engineers with leadership skills into management, we're sifting those abilities out of our engineering pool. We can end up without the skills that we need to make our projects successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experienced engineers on the 'technical track' raise everyone's game by modeling what good engineering looks like. They have the mix of engineering and organisational context that's needed to drive projects that most engineers wouldn't be able to tackle. And they talk to each other, ensuring that our technical decisions make sense even when looked at through a global …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>A few days ago, a former colleague told me his current team was reluctant to give TDD a chance. Here are the typical comments he heard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Adding a test in this old code is a three weeks task!”</p>

  <p>“All the tests we wrote in this code are mock-ridden, unmaintainable, and useless!”</p>

  <p>“How can we go tests first, when the code is already written?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have worked with teams dealing with legacy code, you must have heard similar complaints.</p>

<h2 id="the-barriers-to-tdd-for-legacy-code">The barriers to TDD for Legacy Code</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/chainlink.jpg" alt="Close up photograph of a chainlink. There are barriers to overcome when starting TDD for Legacy Code"></p>

<p>All these difficulties boil down to two root causes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s impossible to write tests before code that was already written.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Legacy code makes everything more complicated. In our case, it increases the learning curve of TDD for the team.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>To get a team dealing with legacy code to do TDD, you’ll need to address these two fundamental barriers.</p>

<p>One option could be to put more pressure on the team: “From now on, TDD is mandatory.” This strategy is not going to work for long. We want a sustainable pace, and the only way to get it is through regular learning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to coach the team to one effective technique to apply TDD in the legacy code context.</li>
  <li>The next step is to leverage this momentum to set up regular practice sessions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-straightforward-technique">A straightforward technique</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/railway.jpg" alt="Photo of a straight railway. It's best to start TDD for Legacy Code with one straightforward but effective technique."></p>

<p>Here is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful and straightforward TDD for legacy code technique</strong>. Let’s say you need to add a new feature:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refactor the existing code to introduce an extension-point to host your new feature</li>
  <li>Implement your new feature using TDD. Make it compatible to your extension-point</li>
  <li>Once your new feature is ready, plug it in the legacy code through the extension-point</li>
  <li>Check that the whole thing is working. Use whatever test you have, either manual or automated</li>
  <li>If it’s not working as you expect, repeat the whole cycle (adapt extension point, TDD your new feature…)</li>
</ol>

<p>All this might sound very easy in theory. Unfortunately, it can get pretty complicated in practice! Before trying this in production code, it’s a good idea to practice and learn. Let’s see how to do that!</p>

<h2 id="the-gilded-rose-kata">The Gilded Rose Kata</h2>

<p>The gilded rose is a famous kata to practice refactoring techniques. I am going to use it to illustrate the above plan.</p>

<p>The gilded rose is an inventory management function. The goal of the kata is to manage a new kind of item: conjured items. Conjured items behave like standard items, except that they age twice as fast. You can check <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt">the full instructions on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into the code!</p>

<h3 id="refactoring-to-an-extension-point">Refactoring to an extension-point</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/plug.jpg" alt="Photo of a plug on a blueprint. An effective first step to start TDD for Legacy Code is to refactor legacy code to make it easy to inject new features"></p>

<p>The first step in our plan is to change the existing code before injecting our new feature. This step can be tricky as it touches the legacy code, and we don’t want to break anything. Here are a few principles to cut risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stick to the smallest possible change</li>
  <li>Use any validation technique you have at your disposal:
    <ul>
      <li>End to end tests</li>
      <li>Manual tests</li>
      <li>Integration tests</li>
      <li>Setting up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test">Golden Master test</a> for the occasion is also a smart move.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use many pairs of eyes. <strong>Refactoring in pair or mob will drastically reduce the risk for regression.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the gilded rose kata comes with a golden master test. It’s a test that “snapshots” the behavior of your code to let you refactor it. It’s temporary because a precise snapshot is unmaintainable. You can learn more about the golden master technique through this live refactoring.</p>

<p>The gilded rose kata uses the <a href="https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp">ApprovalTests.cpp</a> library to help us with Golden Master testing. All we need to do is to add a set of test combination to the existing test:</p>

<p>Now that we have a regression test, we are ready to change the existing code, so let’s try to add an extension point. One way to do this is to add an array of ‘item updaters’ that can take care of specific types of items.</p>

<h4 id="cppsrcgildedroseh"><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/cpp/src/GildedRose.h">cpp/src/GildedRose.h</a></h4>

<p>The first thing we’ll do is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an ItemUpdater abstract class</li>
  <li>Add a list of ItemUpdater objects to the GildedRose constructor</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span><span>ItemUpdater</span><span>();</span>

    <span>virtual</span> <span>bool</span> <span>handles</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>Item</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>};</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>();</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll just need to adapt the constructor calls from the tests with an empty array of ItemUpdaters <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p>In the implementation, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store the ItemUpdater objects</li>
  <li>Extract an <code>updateQuality(Item&amp;)</code> method to handle a single item</li>

<p>It is now possible to inject an implementation for conjured items.</p>

<h3 id="code-conjured-items-with-tdd">Code conjured items with TDD</h3>

<p>The implementation of our extension point needs to deal with two aspects:</p>

  <li>declare that it will handle conjured items</li>
  <li>update quality and sellIn for a conjured item</li>

Boats will be able to sail around the city centre again for the first time in years from 2pm.</p><p>‘This is a historic moment for Utrecht,’ said Eelco Eerenberg, head of the station area for the municipality. ‘A lot of people from Utrecht and from outside Utrecht have always said it was a huge mistake to fill the Utrecht Singel and now after years of building work, this fault will be made good. The inner city will once again be surrounded by water and greenery.’</p><p>The city had originally intended to have a larger ceremony but due to coronavirus restrictions, DutchNews.nl understands, is celebrating the moment in a smaller way.

However, from the 1950s, a series of traffic management plans have replaced much of the water with roads (although one segment was listed and preserved by the Dutch government).</p><p>Following increasing pressure to reopen the Singel canal, residents voted in a 2002 referendum for a ‘master plan’ for the centre involving digging up the roads on the Weerdsingel and Catharijnesingel and replacing them with water again. Utrecht is also building a covered shopping centre, which boats will be able to sail underneath.</p><p>‘You can see the Singel as part of the kaleidoscope of modern city development,’ added Eerenberg. ‘An old military hospital is now a hotel, a monastery become a teaching hospital and then homes and offices…They all had important functions for the city in their time and their place on the Singel.’</p><p>He said that now the city is developing ‘green’ and ‘blue’ corridors for people and nature to develop, with the aim of increasing wellbeing. The Singel will also be joined to the Leiden Rijn and is expected to improve migration routes for thousands of fish.</p><p>‘There’s not much space in the city, and cars take up a lot of room relative to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport,’ said Eerenberg. ‘But these also contribute to cleaner air for residents and liveability.

        <h4>Progressive Web Apps are getting a lot of hype these days, and there is a good reason.</h4>
                <h6>
                    By Asaf Gur, Published 2018-02-26
                </h6>
    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="hype-and-buzz">Hype And Buzz</h2>
<p>Progressive Web Apps are getting a lot of hype these days, and there is a good reason. They offer strong advantages to most types of apps. Having an app on your phone for just about anything, doesn't make any sense to me.. However, serving apps through a web browser is in my opinion inevitable.<br>
So what's all the fuss about?<br>
In a sentence - Serving mobile apps through a browser, and that's all there is to it.
But before we talk about what's good or bad about it, let me take you on a trip on my imaginary time machine.</p>
<h2 id="lets-pretend-we-have-a-time-machine">Let's Pretend We Have A Time Machine</h2>
<p>Let's say that we are done doing all the cool stuff time machines offers - Going to a Jimmy Hendrix concert, watching the big bang (the real one not the series), meeting Einstein or whatever kind of time traveling stuff that you are in to. Let's go back to somewhere around the year 2000, and see what apps you had on your desktop or laptop. My guess is, you had some utilities like antivirus, unzip and stuff like that. Some communication apps, like icq or skype, some “professional” softwares such as a word processor or photo editor, and maybe some games. Of course, last but not least - a web browser.<br>
As time progressed, more and more software went from running on your machine to running on your web browser. Nowdays, I am sure that having a news app on your desktop would feel pretty strange. In fact, there's a chance that you have little or no apps on your machine, and that you are quite happy with just a web browser. Mobile phones are a bit different, and we are not in the year 2000, but some say history is bound to repeat itself.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-so-good-about-progressive-web-apps">So What's So Good About Progressive Web Apps?</h2>
<h4 id="look-and-feel">Look And Feel</h4>
<p>Progressive web apps look and feel like native apps.<br>
Their features in respect to user experience are almost the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on full screen.</li>
<li>Home screen button.</li>
<li>Work offline.</li>
<li>Notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="easy-for-the-developers">Easy For The Developers</h4>
<p>With Progressive Web Apps, you let the browser do the heavy lifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>One codebase for all platforms.</li>
<li>Fits on any screen size.</li>
<li>All your users have your latest version, always</li>
<li>No restricments from app stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can checkout <a href="https://whatwebcando.today/" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://whatwebcando.today/%3C/a%3E">https://whatwebcando.today/&lt;/a&gt;</a> if you want to see which hardware features are supported.</p>
<h4 id="easier-for-marketing">Easier For Marketing</h4>
<p>Users can discover your web app through a search engine, or click a just click link.
Today, when you advertise an app, the flow is like this: The user sees your ad and clicks on it. The user is then redirected to your app's store page. There the user has to download your app, open it and of course use it.<br>
With Progressive Web Apps: The user sees your ad and clicks it. The user is either on your app or redirected to a browser and then on your app. It's much shorter.</p>
<h4 id="better-for-the-users">Better For The Users</h4>
<p>Last, but not least:</p>
<ul>
<li>No installation process.</li>
<li>Minimal disk space consumption.</li>
<li>Faster loading times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-we-there-yet">Are We There Yet?</h2>
<p>Well, no. There are still some hurdles to jump over.</p>
<p>Users nowdays are looking for apps in the app stores, so if your app is not there - they might not find it.<br>
How do you even explain Progressive Web Apps to a user? It's not very clear, and most people are not aware of it.<br>
So it's a mobile web page? Or is it an app? Do I have to download it?</p>
<p>There is also the issue of the home screen button. The user has to first visit the web app, then go to the browser menu and click on “Add to home screen”. This is not intuitive and just not good enough.</p>
<p>Many users have more than one browser on their phone and can open your app with both. This can be very confusing, both for you and for the user. The user might see your app twice on their home screen, and you might think you have two different users.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-for-everybody">It's Not For Everybody</h2>
<p>I believe that some apps will always need to be installed on the device. Wether it's performance issues or just the nature of the app. It would be really strange to see an alarm clock progressive web app, right? makes no sense really. Games usually need better performance and we can expect that they'll perform better when they are properly installed.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-progressive-web-apps-out-there-that-i-can-see">Are There Progressive Web Apps Out There That I Can See?</h2>
<p>Yes! You are already looking at one.</p>
<p>But other than that:</p>

    <div>
  
  <p><span>Sep 12, 2020</span></p><p>As a cloud platform <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) offers over 175 services. If you pay attention, you’ll notice that people often do mistakes in the names of these services. For example they say <em>Amazon</em> Lambda instead of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"><em>AWS</em> Lambda</a>, or <em>AWS</em> DynamoDB instead of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/"><em>Amazon</em> DynamoDB</a>.</p>
<p>While it’s important to use correct names and terms, it’s also hard or at least tricky sometimes. I’ve created a little tool to help with that and made it open source.</p>
<p>The tool is an extension for prose linter called <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/about">Vale</a>. If you work with text, this linter is <em>highly</em> recommended.</p>
<h2 id="some-details-about-vale">Some details about Vale</h2>
<p>Vale is a syntax-aware linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind.</p>
<p>Unlike most writing-related software, Vale’s primary purpose isn’t to provide its advice; it’s designed to enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based extension system.</p>
<p>Vale uses a plain-text (INI and YAML) configuration system that makes it possible to share configurations across platforms, applications, and users.</p>
<p>And the best of all Vale is open source. That means you have a chance not just to look into well-written code (Go), but also contribute 😉</p>
<h2 id="a-little-challenge">A little challenge</h2>
<p>To extend Vale it’s necessary to craft a configuration file. A <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/styles#substitution"><code>substitution</code> style</a> helps to achieve this goal because then the linter <em>suggests</em> correct options and not just complains about mistakes.</p>
<p>Turns out it isn’t easy to find a list of all AWS services in a machine-readable format. Also, it MUST include correct names. <a href="https://github.com/juanibiapina">@juanibiapina</a> suggested a brilliant idea to use <a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/">the AWS status page</a> 💡</p>
<h2 id="a-small-discovery">A small discovery</h2>
<p>The phase of testing and polishing the substitution style revealed a fact, that the AWS status page uses the name “Auto Scaling” (without any prefix) which is incorrect as the service name is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/autoscaling/"><em>AWS Auto Scaling</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p><img src="https://sul.im/blog/images/screenshot-aws-vale-demo-output.png" alt="AWS Vale demo output"></p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/soulim/vale-aws">AWS style for Vale on GitHub</a>. Grab the latest release if you aren’t interested in technical details.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>If you use GitHub Actions, there is <a href="https://github.com/soulim/vale-aws-demo/pull/1/checks?check_run_id=1078148144">an example</a> of how AWS style for Vale helps to avoid mistakes in each commit.</p>

      <p>One of the <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/questions">Collison questions</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is Bloom's "Two Sigma" phenomenon real? If so, what do we do about it?</strong></p>
<p>Educational psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bloom">Benjamin Bloom</a> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf">found</a> that one-on-one tutoring using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a> led to a <em>two sigma</em>(!) improvement in student performance. The results were replicated. He asks in his paper that identified the "2 Sigma Problem": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?</p>
<p>In a related vein, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919">this large-scale meta-analysis</a> shows large (&gt;0.5 <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d">Cohen's d</a>) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. "Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Answering the question requires first to explain what <em>Direct Instruction</em> and <em>Mastery Learning</em> mean.</p>
<h3 id="scope-of-the-present-article">Scope of the present article</h3>
<p>This article is concerned with a general study of Bloom's two sigma problem, which in turn involves an examination of an educational method, mastery learning, and tutoring. I have also included a review of software-based tutoring. Later on I look at educational research in general, spaced repetition, and deliberate practice, as these seem closely related to the core topics of this review for reasons that will be obvious after reading through it.</p>
<p>I am only concerned here with student performance in tests, not with other putative benefits from education; I don't look in detail at what keeps students motivated, what makes them feel well, what makes them more creative, or better citizens.. I could have looked at longer term measures of success (e.g. income later on in life) but I couldn't find such studies.</p>
<p>As a general note, when discussing effect sizes here,  unless otherwise noted, the effect sizes are of the intervention being discussed vs business as usual, using whatever educational method the school was using.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<h4 id="the-two-sigma-problem">The Two Sigma problem</h4>
<p>Benjamin Bloom, decades ago, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf">found</a> that individual tutoring raised student's performance relative to a baseline class by two standard deviations, which is a MASSIVE<sup><a href="#massive">1</a></sup> effect. As 1:1 tutoring is very expensive, he wondered if there are approaches that approximate such an effect that were applicable for larger classrooms. Finding such a method was the "two sigma problem". And Mastery Learning seemed to be the promising way to solve it.</p>
<p><img src="https://nintil.com/images/2019-07-03-bloom-sigma/bloom.png" alt="Image result for bloom two sigma"></p>
<h4 id="direct-instruction">Direct Instruction</h4>
<p>From the meta-analysis cited above, Direct Instruction is a teaching program originally developed by Siegfried Engelmann in the 60s that assumes that any student can learn any given piece of material, and this will happen when </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) they have mastered prerequisite knowledge and skills and (b) the instruction is unambiguous. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't sound that helpful; fortunately the <a href="https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/basic-philosophy.html">National Institute for Direct Instruction</a> has a bit more information. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main features of DI that ensure students learn faster and more efficiently than any other program or technique available:</p>
<p><strong>Students are placed in instruction at their skill level.</strong> 
When students begin the program, each student is tested to find out which skills they have already mastered and which ones they need to work on. From this, students are grouped together with other students needing to work on the same skills. These groups are organized by the level of the program that is appropriate for students, rather than the grade level the students are in.</p>
<p><strong>The program’s structure is designed to ensure mastery of the content.</strong> 
The program is organized so that skills are introduced gradually, giving children a chance to learn those skills and apply them before being required to learn another new set of skills. Only 10% of each lesson is new material. The remaining 90% of each lesson’s content is review and application of skills students have already learned but need practice with in order to master. Skills and concepts are taught in isolation and then integrated with other skills into more sophisticated, higher-level applications. All details of instruction are controlled to minimize the chance of students' misinterpreting the information being taught and to maximize the reinforcing effect of instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Instruction is modified to accommodate each student’s rate of learning.</strong> 
A particularly wonderful part about DI is that students are retaught or accelerated at the rate at which they learn. If they need more practice with a specific skill, teachers can provide the additional instruction within the program to ensure students master the skill. Conversely, if a student is easily acquiring the new skills and needs to advance to the next level, students can be moved to a new placement so that they may continue adding to the skills they already possess.</p>
<p><strong>Programs are field tested and revised before publication.</strong> 
DI programs are very unique in the way they are written and revised before publication. All DI programs are field tested with real students and revised based on those tests before they are ever published. This means that the program your student is receiving has already been proven to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct Instruction is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_teaching">highly scripted</a>, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Contemporary_Educational_Psychology/Chapter_8:_Instructional_Strategies/Mastery_Learning"><em>including even the words they should speak while teaching</em></a>.</p>
<p>Note that Direct Instruction (titlecase) is not the same as <a href="https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/di-vs-di">direct instruction</a> (lowercase), there are various programmes around that have "direct instruction" in the name, like <a href="https://dataworks-ed.com/blog/2014/07/direct-instruction-di-vs-explicit-direct-instruction-edi/">Explicit Direct Instruction</a> . Unless otherwise noted, we'll be talking about Direct Instruction in this review. Both are teacher-centered methods in that the teacher is seen as the one who is transmitting knowledge to the student rather than, say, the student being aided by the teacher in a quest to discover knowledge. Direct Instruction is regulated by the National Institute for Direct Instruction, as mentioned above, while direct instruction is not.</p>
<h4 id="mastery-learning">Mastery learning</h4>
<p>Mastery learning (ML) is not the same as Direct Instruction, but ML <em>is a component of Direct Instruction</em>. It is also one of the methods Bloom originally looked at, so we also examine ML in this review. One key difference is that ML does not called for scripted lessons, while DI requires them.</p>
<p>The key principle of ML is simply to force students to master a lesson before moving on to the next one. At the end of each lesson, on a monthly or weekly basis, students' knowledge is tested. Those students that do not pass are given remediation classes, and they have to re-sit the test until they master it. This can be done in a group setting, as with Bloom's original Learning for Mastery (LFM) programme, or individually, as in Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), where each student advances as their own pace.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>The literatures examined here are full of small sample, non-randomized trials, and highly heterogeneous results.</li>
<li>Tutoring in general, most likely, does not reach the 2-sigma level that Bloom suggested. Likewise, it's unlikely that mastery learning provides a 1-sigma improvement.
<ul>
<li>But high quality tutors, and high quality software are likely able to reach a 2-sigma improvement and beyond. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the methods (mastery learning, direct instruction, tutoring, software tutoring, deliberate practice, and spaced repetition) studied in this essay are found to work to various degrees, outlined below.</li>
<li>This essay covers many kinds of subjects being taught, and likewise many groups (special education vs regular schools, college vs K-12). The effect sizes reported here are averages that serve as general guidance.</li>
<li>The methods studied tend to be more effective for lower skilled students relative to the rest.</li>
<li>The methods studied work at all levels of education, with the exception of direct instruction: There is no evidence to judge its effectiveness at the college level.</li>
<li>The methods work substantially better when clear objectives and facts to be learned are set. There is little evidence of <a href="https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/low_transfer_of.html">learning transfer</a>: Practicing or studying X subject does not improve much performance outside of X.</li>
<li>There is some suggestive evidence that the underlying reasons these methods work are increased and repeated exposure to the material, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a>, and fine-grained feedback on performance in the case of tutoring.</li>
<li>Long term studies tend to find evidence of a fade-out effect, effect sizes decrease over time. This is likely due to the skills being learned not being practiced.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="effect-sizes">Effect sizes</h4>
<p>Assessing if an effect size is meaningful may be hard. A common way of doing so is as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size">follows</a>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Effect size</em></th><th><em>d</em></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Very small</td><td>0.01</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>0.20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>0.50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>0.80</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very large</td><td>1.20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Huge</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>However, one should be able to finetune the descriptive language used, by using a domain-specific reference. In this case, the average effect on performance from one year of schooling  (going from 5th to 6th grade) is d=0.26 for reading performance, and the average effect from 141 large scale RCTs of educational interventions is 0.06, from  Hugues &amp; Matthew (<a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/141754/">2019</a>). Because of this, I will be using a scale adapted from Kraft (<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mkraft/files/kraft_2018_interpreting_effect_sizes.pdf">2018</a>):</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Effect size</em> (E.S.)</th><th><em>d</em></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Small</td><td>&lt;0.05</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>0.05-0.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Large</td><td>0.2-0.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Very large</td><td>0.5-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extremely large</td><td>1-1.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Huge</td><td>&gt;1.5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>With that in mind, here is the summary of the main results, along with the best studies I could find to back up the claims. For comparison, I include Bloom's findings:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em>Method</em></th><th>E.S. (general)</th><th>E.S. (disadvantaged)</th><th>E.S. (Bloom)</th><th>Key references</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Tutoring*</td><td>Very large</td><td>-</td><td>Huge</td><td>VanLehn (<a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Ekvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf">2011</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software-based tutoring (High quality)*</td><td>Very large</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>VanLehn (<a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Ekvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf">2011</a>), Kulik &amp; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654315581420">Fletcher (2016)</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mastery learning**</td><td>Medium</td><td>Large</td><td>Extremely large</td><td>Kulik et al. (<a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Egmswan3/575/kulik_kulik_Bangert-Drowns_1990.pdf">1990</a>), Slavin (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00346543057002175">1987</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direct Instruction**</td><td>Medium</td><td>Large</td><td>-</td><td>Borman et al. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00346543073002125">2003</a>), Stockard et al. (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919">2018</a>)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>* With really good tutors and really good software, the effect size can indeed be Huge.</p>
<p>** When considering narrow knowledge of a series of facts, or basic skills taught at the elementary level, the effects of ML and DI can be Large for the general population and Extremely Large for disadvantaged students. </p>

<hr>
<p>I was recently looking into API Gateways for a project. As I was reading up on AWS’ API Gateway, I realized that there were two options that I could potentially choose: <em>REST APIs</em> or <em>HTTP APIs</em>. The two services had similar names and provided similar features and left me feeling pretty confused about which option was more suitable for my use-case.</p>
<p>One can always count on AWS to create new products that end up confusing people even more. As I started digging deeper to understand the differences, I wondered why Amazon created an entirely new HTTP API service instead of improving the existing REST API service. This way the customers get all the benefits and don’t have to spend time trying to understand the differences and choosing the right service for themselves.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll try and do a comparison between the two services, and hopefully, that will be useful for folks who are trying to decide between the two services.</p>

<h2 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h2>
<p><strong>API Gateway</strong> is a managed service that makes it easier to manage the APIs (creating, publishing, and maintaining secure APIs). API gateway has become one of the pillars of the microservices and serverless architectures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/api-gateway-elements/">This article</a> is a great resource for learning more about API Gateway.</p>
<h2 id="http--rest-apis">HTTP &amp; REST APIs</h2>
<p>The first version of API Gateway was introduced in 2015. The first version of the API Gateway is referred to as REST APIs which is probably the most common usage of the API Gateway.</p>
<p>During re:invent in 2019, Amazon introduced a new flavor of the API Gateway, called HTTP APIs. HTTP APIs were designed from the ground up and thus, are supposed to be faster and cheaper than REST APIs.</p>
<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>
<p>The tables below show the pricing for both HTTP &amp; REST APIs for the us-east-1 region. As shown below, HTTP APIs are significantly cheaper than REST APIs.</p>
<p><strong>REST</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of requests(per month)</th>
<th>Price(per million)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First 333 million</td>
<td>$3.50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Next 667 million</td>
<td>$2.80</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of requests(per month)</th>
<th>Price(per million)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>First 300 million</td>
<td>$1.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>300+ million</td>
<td>$0.90</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-better-apis-http-apis-now-generally-available/">In their announcement</a>, AWS claimed that HTTP APIs are up to 60% faster than REST APIs. I spun up a simple service to compare the performance for myself. To mimic a somewhat realistic scenario, my service makes a call to DynamoDB and an external third party API. From my tests, it seems like AWS’ claims about HTTP APIs being faster does hold up.</p>
<p><strong>REST</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/http-vs-rest/rest-api-perf.png" alt="rest-perf" title="Rest API Performance"></p>
<p><strong>HTTP</strong>
<img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/http-vs-rest/http-api-perf.png" alt="http-perf" title="HTTP API Performance"></p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>There is a lot of feature disparity between the two offerings and its helpful to look at these differences to understand which service is more suitable for one’s requirements.</p>
<p>I have tried to summarize some of the critical differences between the two services below (as of Sep 2020). AWS is actively working on getting HTTP APIs to feature parity with REST APIs, so the list below might change in the future.</p>
<h4 id="throttling">Throttling</h4>
<p>Both HTTP and REST APIs support Account-level throttling. By default, API Gateway limits the steady-state request rate to 10,000 requests per second (rps).
REST APIs also support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html">usage plans</a> with API keys which can be helpful if you need to throttle at an individual API key level.</p>
<p>AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) can also be integrated with the REST APIs to provide additional protection from attacks.</p>
<h4 id="caching">Caching</h4>
<p>HTTP APIs don’t support the ability to cache endpoint responses whereas REST APIs provide this functionality.</p>
<h4 id="tracing">Tracing</h4>
<p>AWS X-Ray can be used to trace requests made via REST APIs whereas this functionality isn’t supported for HTTP APIs.</p>
<h4 id="endpoint-type">Endpoint type</h4>
<p>API Gateway supports three different endpoints types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge-optimized</strong>: Ideal for geographically distributed clients</li>
<li><strong>Regional</strong>: Intended for clients in the same AWS region</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: can only be accessed from your AWS VPC</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, HTTP APIs only support the Regional endpoint type.</p>
<h4 id="request-validation">Request validation</h4>
<p>REST APIs currently support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-request-validation.html">request validation</a> whereas HTTP APIs don’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html">This page</a> from AWS lists all of the differences between the two services.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As of Sep 2020, the main reason to use HTTP APIs seems to be the cost. However, if your APIs need any of the features not yet supported by the HTTP APIs, using the REST APIs will be your best bet. AWS has already built tools that make migrating APIs from REST to HTTP easy, so it will hopefully be straightforward to migrate your APIs in the future.</p>

                        <p>Earlier this year I summed up the perpetual utilitarian lament:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="All%20you%20can%20do%20is%20as%20much%20as%20you%20can." data-author="@sonyasupposedly" cite="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/against-fatalism/">
                      <p>Despite <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smart-rich-and-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nigh-inestimable progress</a>, the world is pervaded by suffering. An unimaginable amount of suffering. Trying to comprehend it specifically and thoroughly makes me feel sick. It is staggering, the magnitude of pain.</p><p>At times the futility of <em>ever fixing this</em> breaks me. How Sisyphean it is, the prospect of searching interminably for new solutions to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140801022058/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordination problems</a>! I lament that positive-sum possibilities can barely be glimpsed through a tangle of innumerable constraints.</p><p>The fact is... it's true. There is tremendous suffering, beyond my ability to convey and beyond the auspices of the word "fix." Nothing can be said, no conclusion can be reached, that will negate that. It is what it is.</p><p>Reality does not have a human value system. The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure. Sometimes the gesture is 🙏, sometimes it's 🖕, and everything in between.</p>

It's not that I'm inordinately empathetic or anything, but I share the typical concern for people's wellbeing. In particular, watching someone close to me Go Through Some Shit is gut-wrenching (again, as it is for most of us). And I know that it won't stop! "Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something." Life is other things too, but it's definitely pain.</p><p>The Problem of Suffering seems like a category error, to borrow / repurpose a framing <a href="https://twitter.com/thesravaka/status/1292953978062475272">from @thesravaka</a>. Suffering <em>is</em>. The Problem of Suffering supposes a fantasy in which it is not, but no clever philosophizing can instantiate that fantasy. We live in the existent world, for which suffering poses no grand problems —&nbsp;that fate belongs to its inhabitants. But whaddaya know, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Backstop#pain-is-the-only-school-teacher">pain is indispensable to survival</a>.</p><p>It's okay to grieve, I think — perhaps even unavoidable, or inadvisable to avoid. I don't know how I'd get through this <em>year</em> without befriending grief, let alone my whole life, and my experiences of both have been pretty good compared to what others have endured.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">one of the hardest parts of growing up has been letting myself feel the pain</p>— 🎀 sonyasupposedly.com 🤖 (@sonyasupposedly) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1302469281372749825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

The most cherished mirages I cry for repeatedly, since they sneak back into my mind to break my heart again. And again.</p><p>I mourn for my fears, for the awful possibility of dreaded outcomes. I mourn for the people I know who are dying, which is all of them, but some much quicker than others.</p><p>There's a lot to let go of, you know? A lot that I can't keep within my grasp. Nor can I pretend to be okay with this state of affairs. Sure, it's okay to <em>not feel okay</em>, but even if it weren't, would that change anything? I would still be appalled by the cruelty of life. I would still struggle with acceptance, despite the relative and objective ease of my circumstances. Likewise, I would still grieve.</p><p>For unnameable reasons I find it therapeutic to examine the facets of pain closely, specifically, and in depth. I want to know how bad it can be. Not firsthand, of course, and thus not with the visceral punch of having learned from experience. Regardless there is understanding to be gained from others' accounts. Would Elie Wiesel have written <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book)">Night</a></em> otherwise?

We're talking very seriously awful, so click with caution.) These days I scarcely have the stomach for extended revelry in prurient gore, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_120_Days_of_Sodom">de Sade's work</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogg_(novel)">Samuel Delany's <em>Hogg</em></a>.

<p>I am not one to cry from reading, but I imagine many a reader would when reading of the despair of life with a young family during a famine and of what they witness. There is much more emotional engagement elsewhere in the story, whether it is the despair of poverty; the frustration of the inequities between rich and poor, men and women, workers and freeloaders; the fear of violence and disappointment in the character's choices.

<p>Wang has known nothing other than the hardworking, precarious, life of a peasant. The life within the House of Hwang is as alien to him as the life of a Westerner. He does not consider how different his life might have been if he had been born into privilege. Nor does he realise, since upward financial and social mobility is his dream, how, if he were to succeed, it would change the way he feels about his wife, the way he would raise his sons or the life he would choose to lead. The thought that his sons might grow up in a completely different environment to himself, with personalities, opportunities, ambitions and wants completely foreign to his own would baffle him.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being productive all the time is not just difficult, it might actually burn you out, but that being said lack of productivity for an extended period of time is dangerous too because it gives the mind an excuse to start looking at all the negative things happening in the world, especially with the global pandemic going on. </p><p>So how does one stay productive consistently? I find that the only way to be productive is through feedback. To be productive you need to receive a small but noticeable reward for attempting to be productive. If that did not make any sense, let me try and explain it with an example.</p><p><strong>Kickstarting the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I wanted to write a piece of content today because I have not written anything in a long period of time. Once this piece is out there on a few social media platforms, I might see a small but noticeable spike in the traffic to my blog which I can confirm from my good friend google analytics. This little spike in traffic is my tiny reward which will kick start a feedback loop.</p><p>Now there is higher likelihood that I will try and write some more content next week because I still remember the feeling of that reward and I want to feel it again, but the difference now is that I have built a tolerance for this reward and the only way I would feel satisfied is if I receive a higher reward which in this case might translate to a higher spike in google analytics.</p><p><strong>Add incremental steps to the loop</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>To receive a higher reward I am now motivated to write better quality content which reaches a wider group of audience and what gets even better is if people start engaging with me after reading my post and wish to dwell further into the subject. </p><p>If I can keep this up every week while slightly increasing the quantum of work but also the quantum of reward, eventually it becomes a habit that I can no longer ignore.</p><p><strong>Use the feedback loop for everything</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I build software, so for me the feedback loop translates to building a small software module that does one particular task, run a few tests on it to see if it functions like it should and this will kick start the feedback loop. I feel rewarded that I built one tiny part of a large project which works perfectly and is ready to be integrated with the rest of the project.</p><p>Incremental steps can then be added by combining different modules with each other and making them work together. The loop becomes much stronger once there is an actual visual component to look at and interact with because at this point you have basically created something tangible and the reward you get from that lasts much longer than the smaller rewards.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>It is entirely possible that I put out this piece of content today and nobody cares. Maybe I do not see any spike in google analytics at all. But the very fact that I managed to write something today and share it a few people who are at the very least likely to give it a read creates a feeling of accomplishment which serves as a small reward to kick start the feedback loop. </p><p>Sometimes the reward is not as great as expected but as long as it is not zero, the loop is strong enough to get you going.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Here's a C function that calls the <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> library to create a Label Widget.  The Label Widget displays the time of the day (like <code>23:59</code>).  This code was taken from the <a href="https://github.com/bosmoment/PineTime-apps/blob/master/widgets/home_time/screen_time.c">bosmoment /
PineTime-apps</a> port of <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> to the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime">PineTime Smart Watch</a>.</p>

    lv_obj_t *label1 = lv_label_create(scr, NULL);

    lv_label_set_text(label1, "00:00");

<p>Functions whose names start with <code>lv_</code> (like <code>lv_obj_create</code>) are defined in the LVGL library. <code>lv_obj_t</code> is a C Struct exposed by the LVGL library. <code>home_time_widget_t</code> is a custom C Struct defined by the RIOT application.</p>
<p>Let's start by converting this function declaration from C to Rust...</p>
<pre><code>lv_obj_t *screen_time_create(home_time_widget_t *ht) { ...

<p>As we convert code from C to Rust, we'll find ourselves doing a lot of this Name/Type Flipping.</p>
<p>Rust is strict about Mutability of variables (whether a variable's value may be modified). <code>*mut</code> declares that the pointer refers to an object that is Mutable (i.e. may be modified). For objects that may not be modified, we write <code>*const</code> (similar to C).</p>

<p>Now let's convert this variable declaration from C to Rust...</p>
<pre><code>lv_obj_t *scr = lv_obj_create( ... ); 
</code></pre>
<p><code>scr</code> is a pointer to a C Struct <code>lv_obj_t</code>. <code>scr</code> is set to the value returned by the C function LVGL <code>lv_obj_create</code> (which creates a LVGL Screen).</p>
<p>In Rust, variables are declared with the <code>let</code> keyword, followed by the variable name and type...</p>

<div><pre><span>let</span> <span>scr</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>lv_obj_t</span> <span>=</span> <span>lv_obj_create</span>( ... );</pre></div>
<p><em>(Yep we did the Name/Type Flipping again)</em></p>
<p>Here's a really cool thing about Rust... Types are optional in variable declarations!</p>
<p>We may drop the type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>, resulting in this perfectly valid Rust declaration...</p>
<pre><code>let scr = lv_obj_create( ... );
</code></pre>
<p><em>What is this type dropping magic? Won't Rust complain about the missing type?</em></p>
<p>If we think about it... <code>lv_obj_create</code> is a C function already declared somewhere. The Rust Compiler already knows that <code>lv_obj_create</code> returns a value of type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>.</p>
<p>Thus the Rust Compiler uses <strong>Type Inference</strong> to deduce that <code>scr</code> must have type <code>*mut lv_obj_t</code>!</p>
<p>This saves us a lot of rewriting when we convert C code to Rust.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks when we convert to Rust the two variable declarations from our C function...</p>

<p>The parameters are missing from the above code... Let's learn to convert <code>NULL</code> to Rust.</p>

<p><code>NULL</code> is an unfortunate fact of life for C coders. In our C code we pass two <code>NULL</code> pointers to <code>lv_obj_create</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  In C: Call lv_obj_create passing 2 NULL pointers
lv_obj_t *scr = lv_obj_create(NULL, NULL); 
</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>NULL</code>s look the same to C... But not to Rust! Let's look at the function declaration in C...</p>
<pre><code>//  In C: Function declaration for lv_obj_create
lv_obj_t * lv_obj_create(lv_obj_t *parent, const lv_obj_t *copy);
</code></pre>
<p><em>From https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/blob/master/src/lv_core/lv_obj.h</em></p>
<p>See the difference? The first parameter is a non-<code>const</code> pointer (i.e. it's Mutable), whereas the second parameter is a <code>const</code> pointer.</p>
<p>Here's how we pass the two <code>NULL</code> pointers in Rust...</p>

<div><pre>
<span>let</span> <span>scr</span> <span>=</span> <span>lv_obj_create</span>(<span>ptr</span>::<span>null_mut</span>(), <span>ptr</span>::<span>null</span>());</pre></div>
<p><code>null_mut</code> creates a <code>NULL</code> Mutable pointer, <code>null</code> creates a Non-Mutable <code>const NULL</code> pointer.</p>
<p><code>ptr</code> references the Rust Core Library, which we import like this...</p>


<p>When we insert the <code>NULL</code> parameters into the converted Rust code, we get this...</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Everything is being scanned. From avocados to Amsterdam, from your living room to the local park, it has become easier than ever to take 3D ‘snapshots’ of physical things.</p><p>This has profound implications for the next major shift in computing: to one in which spatial awareness, machine learning and new devices combine to radically change, well, everything.</p><p>And yet this shift is nearly invisible to those who don’t work in simulated reality ( <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/09/10/apple-developing-new-3d-spatial-audio-format-for-apple-glass-and-other-ar-uses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s term</a> for XR/AR/VR/AcronymX).</p><p>It can even get a bit confusing inside the industry, with so many terms floating around. But Matt Miesnieks makes an important point:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>What if it uses 6dof camera pose and/or processed in real time? Or uses a neural network?</p><p>It’s all the same thing. 3D reconstruction just diff quality, speed, cost</p></div>— Matt Miesnieks (@mattmiesnieks) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattmiesnieks/status/1299741290221903872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>There are dozens of ways to capture reality. And they’re arriving at different resolutions.</p><h2>LiDAR, Cameras and Scans for Everyone</h2><p>Some people like to see photos of food, fashion or cute animals in their social feeds. Myself? I like looking at the latest scans. Call me geeky, but I find this way more sexy than a photo of the latest loaf of bread someone baked:</p><figure></figure><p>Now, this isn’t that much different, really, than taking a selfie in Snapchat and adding a face filter. Your camera is being used to detect the dimensions of what it sees. Snapchat is simply taking a ‘scan’ of your face, detecting its contours, and the ‘filter’ then attaches effects and elements to this unseen scan.</p><p>But with photogrammetry, you can export this scan.</p><p>This, for example, isn’t “real”: it’s a scan that uses <a href="https://www.capturingreality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RealityCapture</a> software to export and use the asset that was created:</p><figure></figure><p>The above is a walk-through of an entirely digital ‘twin’ based on interpreting a camera “walk-through’ of a physical space:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="589" src="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1024x589.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1024x589.jpg 1024w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-768x442.jpg 768w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-1536x884.jpg 1536w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__-770x443.jpg 770w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eglv1oWU0AUT3__.jpg 2024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Until recently. the camera on your phone was the most powerful way to scan 3D objects, faces and spaces. “Behind” the camera was a lot of computing power. Being able to interpret video and convert it into a 3D digital object using software was a big lift.</p><p>Over time, the software became more accessible.</p><p>But if you wanted, for example, to scan a whole city, you needed a Google car driving around with a lot of equipment on the roof.</p><h3>Apple Brings LiDAR to the Masses</h3><p>When <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple added LiDAR to the iPad Pro</a>, it maybe didn’t give you the ability to easily scan a whole city (there’s a limited range to what the LiDAR can see), but it HAS allowed developers to do some pretty detailed scans of nearby rooms and objects.</p><p>Combined with advances to ARKit, the software that developers use to create AR experiences for iOS, you can use the LiDAR to rapidly detect the contours of the world around you:</p><figure></figure><p>This will allow for AR experiences that are richer and more ‘realistic’. But combined with machine learning, it will also power a new generation of apps in other categories.</p><p>I’m expecting, for example, that with the launch of iOS 14, that there will be an explosion of fitness apps which give you a ‘virtual coach’:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large.jpg 980w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large-768x432.jpg 768w, https://shodu.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/large-770x433.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"></figure><h2>Large Scale Scans and Machine Learning</h2><p>So, the ability to scan nearby objects and environments is becoming more and more accessible because of advances in how well your phone’s camera can “see”, as well as the addition of LiDAR to devices like the iPad (and the upcoming iPhone).</p><p>As we shift our view to a larger scale, the kinds of scans that were once reserved to Google Street View cars or owners of highly specialized (and expensive) equipment are now possible at a lower price.</p><p>This has shifted large-scale scanning from being either a niche business or available only to the big players like Apple and Google.</p><p>Once a leader in “professional” LiDAR scans, Velodyne now has competition, with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/lidar-is-becoming-a-real-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies in the field raising millions of dollars</a> in funding to support hundreds of customers.</p><p>We can stitch together multiple scans to create high-resolution digital twins of large spaces that contain a lot of objects:</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.pixel8.earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixel8</a>, meanwhile, is creating a “common ground truth” which aligns different inputs to create a digital twin of large-scale spaces.</p><p>They took a group of 25 volunteers with phones and were able to combine the data into a large-scale digital twin of Boulder Colorado.</p><p>But where THIS gets interesting is the ability to then take that scan and segment it:</p><figure><div><p><iframe title="Boulder semantic segmentation + co registration demo" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sNLZC2wFt0?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><p>Because NOW scans aren’t just 3D models. They’re models with semantic awareness.</p><p>Think of it like photos: at one time, a photo was just an object, an image. But now Facebook or Apple knows that the photo is of YOU. That the person standing next to you is Joe, your best friend.</p><p>Apple sends you “memories” with titles like “Your fuzzy friends” and gives you a collection of photos of your dog. Static images can now be interpreted and the objects in them detected.</p><p>This same awareness is now being carried over to 3D scans.</p><p>Even Apple gives you out-of-the-box abilities to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detect the objects</a> seen by your camera. And with ARKit, this is extended to “tag” objects like tables or to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arreferenceobject" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provide your own models </a>(say, a sculpture in a museum) that can <a href="https://medium.com/@Rozengain/using-vision-framework-object-detection-in-arkit-c0b5366f465d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then be detected</a>.</p><p><strong><em>And so not only are we able to scan objects, but we’re increasingly able to ‘understand’ what we’re seeing.</em></strong></p><h2>What Does It All Mean?</h2><p>There’s a pincer movement: city and planetary-scale scanning (which will power everything from self-driving cars to drone deliveries) is becoming a bigger and bigger business,. And smaller-scale scanning is becoming more and more accessible to individual developers.</p><p>Scans are being exported and used in game engines to create hyper-realistic immersion. <a href="https://shodu.net/unreal-5-the-augmented-reality-roadmap/">Unreal 5 gives us a hint</a> of just HOW immersive this will be:</p><figure><div><p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5 Revealed! | Next-Gen Real-Time Demo Running on PlayStation 5" width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qC5KtatMcUw?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></figure><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I was talking with Pixar cofounder Alvy Ray Smith and asked him if I could share this with you about the new <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealEngine</a> video.

I can scan Main Street, for example, but I still need to deliver that scan to a new visitor if I want to give them a fun/realistic and high-resolution experience.</p><p>5G will be critical to the ability to do this rapidly and effectively. It’s why Niantic has formed a Planet-Scale AR Alliance:</p><figure></figure><p>All of these efforts point to a new generation of spatially-aware computing. The lines are blurring:</p><ul><li>Digital objects can be created by scanning physical ones, or the physical world can be supplemented with things that don’t really exist</li><li>The real world has a digital twin – one that is increasing in size and resolution because of how many companies are attempting to “map reality”</li></ul><p>And this only scratches the surface of what it all means. Because these things are also <strong><em>interactive</em></strong>.</p><p>I can control the physical world within a digital twin that is accessed from the other side of the planet. I can click on physical objects and interact with their digital overlays. Objects can shuttle back-and-forth between physical and digital realities.</p><p>All of those scans I see, all of the little experiments being conducted – they ARE the breakthrough in AR that will power the next few years. They are also the foundation piece in preparing for a sea-change in computing, one where new devices (like glasses) and ambient computing will, eventually, make activities like visiting your Facebook page seem quaint.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I'm proud to release my online 2048 AI, <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">Jupiter</a>. Jupiter uses a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.</p>

</ul>
<h2>More About This Project</h2>
<p>Jupiter (formerly known as Jacob) started as a small AI project in January 2018. I got the idea of using Monte Carlo simulations and search trees as a method to play 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a basic clone of what was described in the answer and built on the idea with an interactive console and my own 2048 game implementation, in contrast to the existing open sourced game code used in other AI projects. At this time, Jupiter ran on the main JavaScript thread, and had decent performance and speed: it was able to run \~800 Monte Carlo simulations of possible games per second. Running the game at 200 simulations per move gave roughly 4 moves per second. This amount of simulations reaches the winning 2048 tile about 65-75% of the time.</p>
<p>In August 2020, I took a look at the project once again and noticed the potential to improve both performance and speed of the AI. I did some more research on Monte Carlo simulations and search trees, notably watching <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-6-monte-carlo-simulation/">a great lecture</a> by MIT Prof. Guttag in MIT's 6.0002 undergraduate course. In the one and a half years since I had first started the project, I'd also learned and used numerous modern JavaScript features, frameworks, and libraries. This put in me the unique position to use these new skills to extend this project vastly from performance, speed, bundle size, and design perspectives.</p>
<p>So, I spent time refactoring existing code and replacing older algorithms with newer and more performant ones. In particular, I took advantage of modern JavaScript features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Workers</a> to differ tasks to new threads and utilize concurrency capabilities. I also added Webpack to the project for the automated speed and bundle size optimizations built into many of its loaders. With new CSS and design skills I had learned over the past one and half years, I built a new design for the site, with a clearer console and mobile responsiveness. And finally, among many other features, I added "tile milestones" to let users know how fast the AI had reached certain tiles in the game.</p>
<p>With the numerous updates to the project in 2020, Jupiter was now able to run \~2650 simulations of possible games per second. Running the game at 200 simulations per move gave around 13 moves per second. This indicated that <strong>performance had more than tripled</strong> with the new updates. Moreover, a new addition to the code allowed for performance to grow and scale horizontally by adding Web Workers and threads as general computing speed increases over time.</p>
<p>All in all, the two year gap in which I learned invaluable frontend development and programming skills allowed me to improve the AI drastically in many areas while maintaining the original, extremely effective Monte Carlo based algorithm which stayed the same throughout the development process.</p>
<p>I hope you find this project interesting and take the time to check it out!</p>

September 12, 2020 | https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Did you know that Apple rolled out support for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fullscreen/">Fullscreen API</a>
on iPad Safari last fall? Well, if you didn’t you do so now. 🙂</p>
<p>What this means is that developers can now create fully immersive web applications for the users on the iPad. It removes every distraction on the screen reliably to help the user focus on the task/content at hand—just like a native app would—and yet it allows them to get away if they wanted to by escaping fullscreen mode.</p>
<p>Meaning, more freedom and better accessibility features of the web! Personally, I think that this is a huge win for the web. <em>It is particularly useful for those of us who use an iPad as their “go to” device for surfing at night</em>. 🤘</p>
<p>While there are some issues in the current implementation of the fullscreen api on iPad Safari, that we will get into shortly, this update from Apple has been nothing short of a bonus for our startup. We built fullscreen capability right into Bubblin’s <a href="https://bubblin.io/">Superbooks</a> for the book-lovers on our site.</p>
<p>The following blogpost explains how we implemented it.</p>
<p>Before we start let’s take a look at the current level of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=fullscreen" target="_blank">vendor support</a> for the fullscreen api:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/fullscreen.jpg" width="100%" alt="fullscreen-api-ipad" title="support fullscreen api ipad safari"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of 1<sup>st</sup> March, 2019 most bugs around escaping fullscreen mode have been resolved by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from Caniuse nearly all major browsers on the desktop and Android devices have had some level of support for the fullscreen API, and now the iOS Safari <del>doesn’t show the latest information</del> too has a decent level of support. <del>This feature was released on iOS 12.0 Safari (Now iPadOS Safari) barely a few days ago and as of November 4th, 2018 March 1st, 2019 Caniuse still doesn’t reflect the changes yet. Hopefully, it will be updated soon!</del> Updated.</p>
<p>Aside from familiar vendor prefixes, and varying method names and a few other minor inconsistencies across implementations, it doesn’t take much to be able to start using the fullscreen api on the iPadOS Safari.</p>
<p>❦</p>
<p>Here’s how I implemented using vanilla javascript:</p>
<p>First, define a named function <code>_toggleFullScreen</code> that lets you <em>toggle</em> between fullscreen and <code>url</code> mode:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
<span>const</span> <span>_toggleFullScreen</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>_toggleFullScreen</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>fullscreenElement</span> <span>||</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozFullScreenElement</span> <span>||</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitFullscreenElement</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>cancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
		<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozCancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>mozCancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
			<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitCancelFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
					<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>webkitCancelFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
				<span>}</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>const</span> <span>_element</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>documentElement</span><span>;</span>
		<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>requestFullscreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>requestFullscreen</span><span>();</span>
		<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>mozRequestFullScreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>mozRequestFullScreen</span><span>();</span>
			<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>webkitRequestFullscreen</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
					<span>_element</span><span>.</span><span>webkitRequestFullscreen</span><span>(</span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>ALLOW_KEYBOARD_INPUT</span><span>);</span>
				<span>}</span>
			<span>}</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This <code>_toggleFullScreen</code> function takes care of all the vendor prefixes and browser quirks across the spectrum. Now we just have to find out which device, browser, and iOS version the user is on to enable the fullscreen functionality for them. We have to determine if the user is (1) <strong>on the iPad</strong> and (2) using the <strong>Safari browser</strong>, and (3) if the browser they are on is <strong>iOS 12 or higher</strong> already. All of that.</p>
<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately) the vendor sniffing technique comes to the rescue:</p>

<p>We tested the code above on quite a few browsers on the iPad, but vendor sniffing, as you might already know, is an inefficient-cumbersome-avoid-as-much-as-you-can solution.</p>
<p>Going forward I expect more browsers on the iPad to support fullscreen api (maybe iPadOS Google Chrome will be next?) or that they will be ruled out using vendor sniffing. Given that support for fullscreen api on tablets will only improve over time, we can easily revisit the sniffer code above until this progressive enhancement melts into broader support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To see the above code working open a <a href="https://bubblin.io/book/bookiza-documentation-by-marvin-danig/1">Superbook on your iPad</a>, turn a few pages and go fullscreen (menu on bottom right under three dots).</p>

<p>Here are a few sample <code>userAgent</code> strings that I used to identify browsers on the iPad:</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>You now have a web-app that can easily go fullscreen on the iPad Safari and people can enjoy it like a standalone/native app without needing to add to the homescreen. Again, I think this is a huge win for the web and you might want to take advantage of it for your app.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently worked on an open source <a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/">project called Jupiter</a>, an online AI to beat the popular online game <a href="http://play2048.co/">2048</a>.</p>
<p>Go try out the AI:</p>
<p><a href="https://jupiter.xtrp.io/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtrp/jupiter/master/demo-image.png" alt="Jupiter Screenshot"></a></p>
<p>In writing this AI, I decided to use a machine learning method called the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Monte Carlo algorithms like the one used in Jupiter have been used in several notable AIs, including DeepMind's <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>, which famously beat the Go world champion in May 2017.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and why the Monte Carlo method works</li>
<li>When and where Monte Carlo algorithms can be useful </li>
<li>How I used the Monte Carlo method in an AI to beat 2048</li>
<li>How to implement Monte Carlo algorithms in JavaScript and other languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I got the idea of using a Monte Carlo method to beat 2048 from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23853848/10007107">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<h2>What is the Monte Carlo Method?</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is the idea of using a large number of random simulations of an experiment to gain insights into the experiment's end results. Random simulations of an experiment are frequently referred to as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you were flipping a coin, and trying to figure out the probability of the coin landing heads. With the Monte Carlo method, we could simulate 10,000 coin tosses, and calculate the percentage of coins that landed heads.</p>
<p>Here's what that would look like.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/using-the-monte-carlo-tree-search-algorithm-in-an-ai-to-beat-2048-and-other-games/coinflip.png" alt="Flip Coin Example Graph"></p>
<p>As can be seen, the result converges to the expected value, 50%. A notable feature of Monte Carlo simulations is that a higher number of simulations is correlated with higher accuracy. For example, if we only performed two simulations, there is a high (25%) probability of heads landing in both simulations, giving a result of 100%. This is very inaccurate in comparison to the expected result of 50%.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations <strong>work because of the Law of Large Numbers</strong>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you simulate the same experiment many times, the average of the results should converge to the expected value of the simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Monte Carlo simulations are a way to estimate what will happen in a given experiment <strong>without having to implement any specific algorithms or heuristics</strong>.</p>
<h2>When and Where the Monte Carlo Method Can Be Useful</h2>
<p>The Monte Carlo method is used in a variety of fields, including game AI development, finance and economics, and evolutionary biology to name a few.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method can be useful in any experiment with a random factor, where end results cannot be predicted algorithmically. For example, in 2048, a new tile at a random location is added after every move, making it impossible to calculate the exact location of upcoming tiles and subsequently the end result of the game as well.</p>
<p>In these types of experiments, running a large number of Monte Carlo simulations can help get a sense of the average end results, the probability of various events occurring, and the relationship between the variables in the experiment.</p>
<p>For example, using the Monte Carlo method to in Jupiter allowed me to better understand how variables like starting move, number of moves in a game, and best tile in the board affected the end results of the game.</p>
<h2>How I Used the Monte Carlo Method in Jupiter, an AI to Beat 2048</h2>
<p>Let's start with a few definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board and Tiles</strong>: a 4x4 grid with tiles optionally placed on each grid spot</li>
<li><strong>Game State</strong>: a set of tiles on the board which represents the board at a specific time</li>
<li><strong>Game Score</strong>: the sum of all the tiles on the board</li>
<li><strong>Real Game</strong>: the game that is being played and shown on the browser, not a simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>At any given game state, let's assume that four possible moves can be made: left, right, up, or down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are indeed cases where a certain move is not possible in a given game state. Removing impossible moves can be easily added to the algorithm later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Monte Carlo method, we can run a set of game simulations for every move.</p>
<p>For each possible move, the program simulates a set of simulations which <strong>start by playing the move for that set first</strong>. After that, the rest of the game can be played completely randomly until it is over.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, this algorithm looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>// assume Game object exists
// assume currentGame variable exists as the real game

const totalSimulations = 200; // 50 simulations are played for each move 

const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
possibleMoves.forEach((move) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>After all the simulations are completed, the program can gather the total final game scores of all the simulations, and average them for each move. We can then find the optimal move by optimizing for the highest final game score.</p>
<p>For example, if the simulations which started by playing left had an average final score of 250, whereas the ones which started by playing the other moves had an average final game score of 225, then left is the optimal move.</p>
<p>In this program, <strong>the optimal move is the one with simulations with the highest average final game score</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: I could have chosen to optimize for a different value such as the number of moves in the game.</strong></p>
<p>However, this would actually make no difference in how the algorithm functions, because the number of moves in the game almost exactly predicts the game score. In 2048, the new tile added after each game move is normally a 2 tile, but has a 10% chance of being a 4 tile instead. This means the expected value of the new tile is 2.2 (<code>2 × 90% + 4 × 10%</code>). The total value of tiles is also preserved after every tile combination (ex: 2 tile combined with another 2 tile gives a 4 tile). As a result, game score can be calculated by multiplying the expected value of the new tile by the number of moves in the game, or with this formula: <code>2.2 × (real game move count + average move count)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add this functionality of optimizing for highest score to our current code: add an array of total final scores for the simulations for each possible move, and choose the move with the highest value in that array to play like so:</p>
<pre><code>const possibleMoves = ["left", "right", "down", "up"];
const totalSimulations = 200;

let moveSimulationTotalScores = [0, 0, 0, 0];

possibleMoves.forEach((move, moveIndex) =&gt; { // simulations for all four possible starting moves
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; totalSimulations / 4; i++) {
    const simulation = new Game(); // create simulation
    simulation.board = currentGame.board; // copy current game state to simulation
    simulation.makeMove(move); // make initial move
    while(!simulation.gameover()) {
      simulation.makeMove(possibleMoves[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)]);
    } // make random moves until simulation game is over
    moveSimulationTotalScores[moveIndex] += simulation.getScore();
  }
});

// make best move with highest total simulation scores
let topScore = Math.max(...moveSimulationTotalScores);
let topScoreIndex = moveSimulationTotalScores.indexOf(topScore);
let bestMove = possibleMoves[topScoreIndex];

currentGame.makeMove(bestMove);</code></pre>
<p>In the end, this algorithm is simple to implement given a well-written 2048 game class. In JavaScript, there are a number of performance upgrades that can be made, starting by adding concurrency with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> and pruning moves with very low final game scores.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In fact, it’s the same kind of power source that runs <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-powered-spacecraft-nasa-history-2017-3" target="_blank">many of our space probes and rovers</a>: nuclear batteries.</p><figure id="w-node-14a21ee8947b-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb77fb527a262153ed9df7_NASA_JPL.jpeg" alt=" NASA/JPL"></p><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/MarsCuriosity" target="_blank"><em>“Can’t stop.

(Image: NASA/JPL).</em></figcaption></figure><p>It might be surprising, but for the long-term operation of onboard systems, there are currently only two viable power sources: solar power and nuclear power.</p><p>And when conditions get really harsh, nuclear power is the only option left.</p><p>Not quite. Nuclear reactors start a controlled chain reaction by bombarding uranium atoms with neutrons. When a uranium atom is hit by a neutron, it splits and releases heat and other neutrons. These neutrons split further uranium atoms, releasing more heat and neutrons, and so on. This process is called <em>fission, </em>and the heat released is used to generate electricity.</p><p>But even when left alone, the atoms that make up uranium or other radioactive materials will split. This is a natural process known as radioactive decay. It occurs much slower than under neutron bombardment, but it still releases enough heat to create a small amount of power — the power of a nuclear battery, and enough to run space vehicles for a long time.</p><p>Imagine you’re out camping. A nuclear reactor is like the campfire: it kicks out some serious heat, enough to keep you warm, dry your clothes, boil a big pot of water and roast food. You can keep it going as long as you like by feeding it more fuel. A nuclear battery, on the other hand, is like the hot embers that get you through the night: enough heat for toasting some marshmallows, but nothing too energy-hungry. And when the embers burn out, that’s it.</p><figure id="w-node-8821d41fb793-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb79d7ea76f35902dff91d_hot%20embers%20of%20a%20nuclear%20reactor.jpeg" alt="hot embers of a nuclear reactor"></p><figcaption>The best materials for making a nuclear battery are created inside<em> </em>a nuclear reactor, so a nuclear battery really is like the hot embers of a nuclear reactor.

Its core is an assembly of pellets containing some <em>radioisotope</em>, usually plutonium-238. (In case you're wondering: This is not the kind of plutonium used in nuclear bombs.) As the plutonium atoms naturally split they give off heat. This heat is converted into electricity using thermocouples, which are wrapped around the plutonium assembly.</p><figure id="w-node-8e34cd69d443-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7a3e788b5f1c140d35b4_NASA%20technicians%20making%20sure%20that%20Curiosity%E2%80%99s%20RTG%20fits%20as%20expected.jpeg" alt="NASA technicians making sure that Curiosity’s RTG fits as expected. "></p><figcaption>NASA technicians making sure that Curiosity’s RTG fits as expected. (Image: NASA, Wikimedia Commons)</figcaption></figure><p>RTGs evolved over time, as missions needed more power and regulations demanded stronger safety features. The plutonium assemblies got bigger and more modular, materials for thermocouples more efficient, and the plutonium pellets were encased in multiple layers of protective materials to shield against radiation and prevent release of materials in case of damage. The underlying principle, however, remained unchanged.</p><h2>The good</h2><p>There are three main requirements a power source needs to satisfy in deep space, and nuclear batteries are the only one to ace all three.</p><h2>Independence from sunlight</h2><p>While solar energy is the undisputed first choice in Earth orbit (the only exception being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet military satellites</a>), there are lot of places in the solar system where sunlight is simply not strong enough. Jupiter is <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4818" target="_blank">the farthest we have traveled using solar arrays</a>. By the time you reach Saturn, sunlight is only 1% as strong as it is on Earth. Even close to home, conditions are not always favorable: Lunar nights, for example, last about two weeks.</p><p>Things would look brighter on Mars, you might think. Mars gets about one third the sunlight that Earth gets, but winter days are short and gloomy. On particularly bad days, the solar-powered rovers <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Spirit </em>and <em>Opportunity</em></a> had reduced power levels that granted them only a few minutes of operation.</p><p>Mars also has dust storms that coat solar panels with layers of dirt. Both rovers had record-breaking lives on Mars, but eventually fell prey to the Martian sand. <em>Spirit </em>had to be given up after it got stuck and was unable to collect enough sunlight to charge. <em>Opportunity </em>went silent after a violent planetary dust storm. From there on, NASA rovers would be powered by nuclear batteries, not solar panels.</p><p>ESA learned the same lesson <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/06/15/first-probe-to-land-on-a-comet-is-awake-but-our-nuclear-fears-cost-us-seven-months-of-data/#4a185cad32aa" target="_blank">an even harder way</a> when its probe Philae made a few mistakes during its historic landing on a comet, ending up in a shady spot where it was unable to collect enough sunlight. It lasted 60 hours, then the onboard batteries were depleted. It took seven more months before Philae had gathered enough energy to briefly communicate again.</p><figure id="w-node-5609ca543393-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7afe527a264a97edd729_comet%2067P_Churyumov-Gerasimenko.jpeg" alt="The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko"></p><figcaption>The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on which Philae landed. With RTGs onboard, light or shade would not have mattered. (Image: ESA)</figcaption></figure><p>Nuclear batteries aren’t troubled by insufficient sunlight. Nor are they phased by the low temperatures of deep space or distant planets. (And it can get <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130920-how-cold-is-space-really" target="_blank">very cold</a> in space.) In fact, the heat produced by radioactive decay is not only used to generate electricity but also to heat the electronics of a spacecraft or rover, thus preventing them from freezing.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0CvzBu5sTps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>‍</p><h2>Reliability</h2><p>When a spacecraft leaves Earth, it also leaves behind any option of maintenance and repair. This means that all its components must function reliably for years without a human hand touching them. Because nuclear batteries are basically a block of plutonium wrapped in some material, there are no moving parts that can wear and there is really not much to maintain.</p><p>Nuclear batteries are used in some places on Earth for the very same reason: to provide power in remote areas where both sunlight and human presence is sparse.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Energy density</strong></h2><p>Energy density is a measure of how much energy you can get for a given mass of fuel. This matters especially for space exploration, because it costs <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/astp.html" target="_blank">a lot</a> to launch something into Earth orbit and beyond. When every gram counts, you want to get as much power as possible out of the fuel you take.</p><p>Nuclear is by far the most dense power source we have. It beats chemical reactions, such as burning gasoline or coal, by an order of millions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb7f139eacb1716858447b_energy%20density.png" alt="full energy density in megajoules/kg"></p><figcaption>(Image: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1162/" target="_blank">xkcd.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Curiosity</em>’s 3 kg (6.6 lbs) of plutonium has delivered energy for close to eight years now, and is designed to last for at least six more. The plutonium also provides the heat that keeps <em>Curiosity </em>warm, meaning no extra electrical power is needed for heating.</p><h2>The bad</h2><p>Nuclear batteries contain radioactive material and therefore come with the risk of contamination in case of leaks, launch accidents, or uncontrolled re-entries. They thus sparked discussions about nuclear technology in space, which were <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/090897sci-nasa-saturn.html" target="_blank">further fueled</a> when Cassini planned to leave Earth with a whopping 33 kg (72 lbs) of plutonium aboard. As a result, safety regulations got stronger, as did testing. “They wanted proof of the worst that could happen, so we did our best to smash them, blown them up, shoot them and break them”, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nuclear-battery-tests/" target="_blank">said NASA test engineer Mary Ann Reimus</a>.</p><p>Cassini launched despite its critics. Space-bound RTGs have an impressive safety record. For example, after the US satellite Nimbus-B had to be destroyed during launch in 1968, its plutonium pellets were recovered intact from the bottom of the sea off the coast of California to be re-used on a later mission.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Nuclear power is an integral part of plans for future space missions, especially for outposts on the Moon and Mars. It remains unbeaten when it comes to energy density and reliability in dark, cold, and harsh conditions.</p><p>As power needs rise, we leave the realm of nuclear batteries. Previous missions used a couple of hundreds of watts, but a future mission to Mars is <a href="https://www.space.com/39433-kilopower-reactor-for-deep-space-missions.html" target="_blank">estimated</a> to need orders of magnitude more. That — as well as <a href="https://www.space.com/5054-plutonium-shortage-thwart-future-nasa-missions-outer-planets.html" target="_blank">a shortage of plutonium</a> — is why <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-nuclear-reactor-kilopower-how-it-works-2018-5?r=DE&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">plans for future outposts will likely rely on fission reactors</a>. And <a href="https://beyondnerva.com/" target="_blank">innovation</a> doesn't stop there.</p><p>The story of nuclear power in space exploration thus seems to be only beginning. From its humble origins powering space probes and rovers, nuclear power is set to underpin mankind’s reach for other planets… and beyond.</p><figure id="w-node-ea287c409d0d-e9613e2d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b66a3b25b239d107d3595ea/5ebb8031b4d08e8d77faacf9_Spirit%E2%80%99s%20photo%20of%20a%20Martian%20sunset..jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.erikwernquist.com/wanderers" target="_blank">Wanderers by Erik Wernquist</a>, based on Spirit’s <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140302.html" target="_blank">photo</a> of a Martian sunset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the web page for the Bayesian Data Analysis course at Aalto (CS-E5710) by <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/">Aki Vehtari</a>.</p>
<p>Aalto students should check also <a href="https://mycourses.aalto.fi/user/index.php?id=28239">MyCourses announcements</a>. In Autumn 2020 the course will be arranged completely online. This web page will be much updated during the August.</p>
<p>All the course material is available in a <a href="https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto">git repo</a> (and these pages are for easier navigation). All the material can be used in other courses. Text (except the BDA3 book) and videos licensed under CC-BY-NC 4.0. Code licensed under BSD-3.</p>

<div id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic terms of probability theory
<ul>
<li>probability, probability density, distribution</li>
<li>sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule</li>
<li>expectation, mean, variance, median</li>
<li>in Finnish, see e.g. <a href="http://math.aalto.fi/~lleskela/LectureNotes003.html">Stokastiikka ja tilastollinen ajattelu</a></li>
<li>in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/">Introduction to probability and statistics</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some algebra and calculus</li>
<li>Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
<ul>
<li>histogram, density plot, scatter plot</li>
<li>see e.g. <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/demos.html#BDA_R_demos">BDA R demos</a></li>
<li>see e.g. <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/demos.html#BDA_Python_demos">BDA Python demos</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest computational tools.</p>
<p>If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend</p>
<ul>
<li>For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and causal analysis see <a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">Gelman, Hill and Vehtari, "Regression and Other Stories"</a>.</li>
<li>Richard McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking, 2nd ed</a> book is easier than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019">Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan</a> are highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.</li>
<li>For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4 and 5 in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/">Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis"</a> useful.</li>
</ul>

						Informal workers and street vendors in Latin America have been among those most heavily affected by the pandemic					</span>
							</p><div>
			<div>
				<div>
				
<p>For decades, the region had success in lifting people out of poverty, as impoverished rates had fallen to about 30 percent recently. Unfortunately, that progress is sure to be reversed as the COVID-19 pandemic is set to bring a historic recession to Latin America and widen the wealth inequality gap even further.</p>



<p>The mobilization of poorer people to the middle class is a road that may no longer exist for many in Latin America, as regional leaders and organizations still need to coordinate on needed stimulus efforts that could help keep people afloat.</p>



<p>In all, Latin America is at risk of losing up to 45 million jobs because of the pandemic, analyst Diego García Saucedo <a href="https://www.eldinero.com.do/118081/america-latina-perdera-mas-de-45-millones-de-empleos-por-covid-experto-mexicano/">told the Spanish news wire EFE</a> last week. </p>



<p>The all-important tourism and service industries have been particularly hard hit as international and domestic travel has slowed to a crawl. In addition, the propensity of informal work like that of street vendors seen throughout the region has also been negatively affected while people stay in their homes and adhere to lockdowns.</p>



<p>As the current COVID-19 epicenter, here’s a look at how jobs are faring in some of Latin America’s most prominent countries. </p>



<h4><strong>Brazil</strong></h4>



<p>Brazil’s inadequate response to the coronavirus has made it the second biggest hotspot of coronavirus cases in the world behind only the United States. With more than 3.7 million cases and 117,000 deaths, the damage left by COVID-19 has been immense. </p>



<p>The jobless rate in Brazil is now at 13.3 percent, per the latest numbers from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. This represents the worst rate of unemployment the country has seen in three years, and unfortunately, things keeping trending in the wrong direction.</p>



<p>As President Jair Bolsonaro continues to make the pandemic political – he previously tried to outlaw mask-wearing in public places like schools and churches – and the government fails to flatten the curve, the country’s workers will be the ones suffering.  </p>



<h4><strong>Chile</strong></h4>



<p>The unemployment rate in Chile has skyrocketed to 12.2 percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). That is the highest jobless rate in a decade and way up from the 8.3 percent from this time last year. </p>



<p>No one has been as heavily impacted as those working in the food industry, although there have also been massive job losses in construction and the commercial sector. President Sebastián Piñera announced a two-year economic recovery package in July worth $12 billion that is aimed at helping Chile’s most vulnerable with direct payments and emergency benefits.</p>



<p>Last year, Chileans spilled out into the streets to protest the growing inequality in the country, demanding change to the system of privatized pensions. There could be growing unrest if the economy does not recover quickly and jobs continue to be lost.</p>



<p>As with the rest of the region, Chile is expected to go into recession this year and suffer a contraction of up to 7.5 percent.</p>



<h4><strong>Colombia</strong></h4>



<p>In Colombia nearly one in five people are without jobs. Despite early planning and progressive local policies designed to keep people safe during the pandemic, Colombia’s workers have been among the hardest hit in the region. But, in a country that already had the highest unemployment rate in the region, the coronavirus has served to highlight existing problems in Colombia’s economy.</p>



<p>The 19.8 percent unemployment rate is a gradual improvement from May’s 21.4 percent rate, but both are a far-cry from August of last year when 10.8 percent of the country’s workforce was without jobs.</p>



<p>As with many other countries in the region, informal labor is crucial to the economy. The majority of Colombia’s population depends on informal work to get by, and this work is even more vulnerable to lockdowns and stay-at-home restrictions.</p>



<h4><strong>Ecuador</strong></h4>



<p>One million Ecuadorians are unemployed, which is more than triple the amount of those without jobs in December. Another 5 million are reported to be in “precarious” or unstable jobs, according to Ecuador’s National Statistics and Census Institute. Of those who still do have jobs, <a href="https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/08/12/nota/7938592/jornada-laboral-ecuador-trabajo-empleo-desempleo-sobornos-seguros">a recent study</a> found that 9,000 Ecuadorians have seen their hours and wages cut by half.</p>



<p>Ecuador was noted as being one of the first countries to be dramatically impacted by COVID-19 when an outbreak struck the city of Guayaquil in March. Since then they have been able to flatten the curve and minimize the spread.</p>



<p>However, the economy remains in rough shape and the country is looking to move on from its deeply unpopular president, Lenín Moreno, who has said he will not seek re-election in next February’s vote.</p>



<h4><strong>Mexico</strong></h4>



<p>Mexico’s June unemployment rate was registered at 5.5 percent and the country is seeing large amounts of people enter into the informal labor economy without contracts or benefits. Now more than half (53 percent) of the country’s people are working informally. </p>



<p>Because the country is in a deep debt, it has been unable to offer protections that others in the region have like direct payments.</p>



<p>Mexico was already entering into a recession before the pandemic hit. But now, the Mexican economy is expected to contract by 13 percent.</p>



<p>One surprising development during this ordeal has been the fact that remittances sent from family members working in the U.S. back to Mexico have actually risen. Although that number could go down if cases in the U.S. remain high and the economy falters.</p>



<h4><strong>Peru</strong></h4>



<p>Behind only Brazil, Peru has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America. And with that, jobs have unsurprisingly plummeted. </p>



<p>Peru’s unemployment rate for August came in at 16.4 percent, the highest rate of joblessness so far for the Andean nation during the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time last year, just 6 percent of Peruvians were unemployed. Currently, more than 570,000 people are looking for work. </p>



<p>Construction, food service, and transportation are among the most negatively affected industries in the country. Also impacted has been the mining sector, which is crucial to Peru’s economy.</p>



<p>That’s a large part why Peru is set to undergo a contraction of 12 percent and plunge into its worse economic standing in 30 years.  </p>

                <center><em><p>The most ambitious crossover event in automatic differentiation history</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Friday, September 11, 2020 · 4 min read</h4>
<blockquote>
<p> Summary of this post: It turns out that by carefully mixing forward-mode and
 reverse-mode automatic differentiation, you can greatly simplify certain
 hyperparameter optimization algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a fun recursive idea: just like how we optimize the parameters of
machine learning models by gradient descent, we can also their
<em>hyperparameters</em> by gradient descent. This is by no means a new idea; you can
find 20-year-old papers that discuss (for example) optimizing gradient descent
step sizes by gradient descent itself.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two ways to do this. The “short-term” way is to take a
<em>single</em>  step of gradient descent, and then based on how that goes, adjust the
hyperparameters. That’s the premise of the 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782">Online Learning Rate
Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent</a>: it
turns out that you can do this in an extremely lightweight way. You would hope
that over time the hyperparameters converge to something optimal alongside the
parameters (and indeed that is the case, though you have to be careful).</p>
<p>The “long-term” way is to train <em>several</em> steps and <em>then</em> backpropagate
through the <em>entire training</em> to adjust the hyperparameters. The hope is that
this provides a stronger “signal” to the hyperparameter-gradient, which is
better for convergence. But, this comes at the (tremendous) expense of having
to store a copy of the entire computation graph for several steps of training,
and then backpropagate through it. If your model has 1GB of parameters, you
need to store ~1GB worth of numbers for <em>each step</em>. You can imagine that adds
up over the course of many epochs, and so the algorithm is severely limited by
how much RAM you have.</p>
<p>The 2015 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03492">Gradient-based Hyperparameter Optimization through Reversible
Learning</a> makes this work by throwing away
the intermediate steps of the computation graph and then JIT-re-computing it
“in reverse” during backpropagation. It’s a clever technique, but kind of hairy
and hard to implement (you have to be super careful about numerical precision).</p>
<p>Here’s a graph that visualizes these two techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13371">from this
paper</a>). You’re looking at several parallel
loss curves (($\log(f)$) is the loss plotted on a log scale), pointing towards
you, arranged in order of the “step size” hyperparameter
(that’s ($\log(\alpha)$)). The orange curve represents a “short-term”
hyperparameter optimization, which is allowed to move along the “step size”
axis at each step. The “long-term” hyperparameter optimization instead
optimizes directly on the thick black dashed “U” — that is, after <em>several</em>
steps of training. You can see how the latter is smoother, but also much harder
to compute.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/fig-metasurface.png" alt="The preceding paragraph explains this
figure."></p>
<p>To summarize: the short-term way is cheap but noisy. The long-term way is
expensive but less noisy. Can we get the best of both worlds?</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, let’s think more carefully about the source of the expense. The problem
is that we need to store (or be able to reconstruct) the full computation graph
in order to do backpropagation. Okay, but do we really <em>need</em> to do
backpropagation? The only reason we backpropagate is that it’s more efficient
in the case when you want derivatives with respect to <em>many</em> different
variables. If you have millions of model parameters, backpropagation is
millions of times faster than the much simpler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers">forward-mode (“dual numbers”)
automatic
differentiation</a>.</p>
<p>But we <em>don’t</em> have millions of <em>hyperparameters!</em> Step size, for example, is
just a single number. The Adam optimizer only has a total of 4 hyperparameters.
With this in mind, backpropagation isn’t even the right choice — we <em>should</em>
be using dual numbers for the hyperparameter optimization. On the other hand,
we should still be using backpropagation for the “inner loop” that optimizes
the (non-hyper-) parameters. That is, we want to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>initialize hyperparameters
# loop to optimize hyperparameters
while True:
  initialize parameters
  # loop to optimize parameters
  for i in range(100):
    run model on data to get loss
    # using reverse-mode!
    compute d(loss) / d(parameters)
    update parameters using hyperparameters
  # using forward-mode
  compute d(loss) / d(hyperparameters)
  update hyperparameters
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>(Update: I discovered that this was suggested in the 2017 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01785">Forward and
Reverse Gradient-Based Hyperparameter
Optimization</a>. But keep reading — while
the paper’s
<a href="https://github.com/lucfra/FAR-HO/blob/master/far_ho/hyper_gradients.py#L375">implementation</a>
needs a lot of math to be worked out manually, I’m going to show you how to
implement this in a way that makes all the math in the paper fall out “for
free”…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal raises a logistical question: how do we reconcile these two
automatic differentiation algorithms in the same program? <strong>The “trick” is to
“thread” dual numbers through a backpropagation implementation.</strong> In other
words, implement backpropagation as usual, but rather than <code>float</code> type
numbers, exclusively use <code>dual_number</code> type numbers (even when doing derivative
calculations). Initialize the system such that the dual numbers track
derivatives with respect to the hyperparameters you care about. Then, your
final loss value’s attached ($\epsilon$)-value <em>immediately</em> gives you
<code>d(loss)/d(hyperparameters)</code>. No backpropagation needed — and so, it’s safe
to “forget” the computation graph.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s all I wanted to share in this blog post! :)</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not obvious how to implement this in PyTorch, since you can’t
naïvely do <code>tensor(dtype=dual_number)</code>. Rather than hack in a custom numeric
data type that implemented dual numbers, I wrote my own tiny implementations of
forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. It’s just a couple dozen
(very-recognizable-to-automatic-differentiation-enthusiasts) lines of code. I
was careful to make each implementation generic in the kind of “number” it
accepts. That allowed me to run the reverse-mode algorithms using the
forward-mode data types.</p>
<p>Running it on a simple quadratic optimization problem, we can see that updating
the hyperparameter ($\alpha$) yields better-looking loss curves — in this
GIF, we’re discovering that we should increase the step size. Yay!</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/loss.gif" alt="GIF of loss curve becoming better over
time"></p>
<p>I think this is a very neat trick, which surely has other cool applications
(for example, differentiating through long-running physics simulations!). If
you’re curious, check out this <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/hybrid-hyperoptimization/hybrid-hyperoptimization.ipynb">IPython
notebook</a> for
the full source code. Feel free to adapt it to your ideas. Then, tell me what
you’ve built!</p>

A good, blameless feedback culture is essential for working together efficiently as it forms healthy relationships, fuels personal and professional growth and aligns us with common norms. Feedback is one of the cornerstones of company culture.</p>
<p>All that said I’ve found that giving good feedback is quite problematic for most of the people (me included!). There’s a social stigma to giving so-called constructive feedback (see, even the name is somewhat of a euphemism), we feel we’re expected to be nice to each other and surely telling someone they were wrong is not nice. We also tend to be way too simple and not specific when giving praise - no, a simple ‘well done’ is usually not considered as useful feedback.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a few key points about giving useful feedback. I promise it’s all easy and trivial, you just need to consciously practice it.</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The how</h2>
<p>One of the most important things is getting buy-in for providing feedback. That gives back some of the control to the recipient and helps in having a more open mindset compared to unsolicited feedback. Simply ask if the other party is open to talk about the certain topics. Give some context so they can decide. E.g. “May I share some thoughts about the daily standup we had today?”
Be objective and be specific. These support each other, generalization tends to lead to giving feedback on perceived character traits which is a huge anti-pattern (“You always commit bad code.").
There are a few feedback models out there, what worked the best for me is the SBI (Situation - Behavior - Impact) model. This helps in giving enough context and specificity and being objective. An example: “During the standup today you didn’t mention you were blocked in your work and by this we missed our chance to deploy today, resulting in a delay in delivery.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t use the feedback sandwich technique (starting with a compliment, then negative feedback, then an optional compliment again). Unfortunately it’s still something certain coaches suggest - my advice is that it’s not OK. There’s a reason some call it sh*t sandwich. It shows that you’re not confident in your communication and gives mixed signals, practically killing the actionability of your feedback.</li>
<li>Don’t include suggestions in your feedback! That’s the next step, but it’s not part of the feedback. It’s very easy to slip into this anti-pattern: “Why didn’t you just use library X? That would make so much sense”. First, this is not feedback, this is question, second it’s not objective but you’re talking about your opinion, not the other person’s behavior and its effect.</li>
<li>Follow the SBI model even for praises! We tend to oversimplify positive feedback. A pat on the shoulder, a thumbs-up or a ‘nice job!’ has its place and value but the point of positive feedback is more than just recognition: it’s also to make the other person understand what exactly went well in what context and how to repeat that in the future. It’s much nicer to hear “By helping me out with data about the costs during my presentation yesterday we successfully convinced the board to fund our roadmap, thank you for that!” vs. “Thx for the help!”</li>
<li>It’s even better to focus on data than behavior (if you can).</li>
<li>Always leave room for the other party to express their thoughts on the matter and even disagree. You can facilitate this by asking how they feel about the issue.</li>
<li>Make sure to agree on a course of actions together. It’s not enough to drop your feedback and leave. You can help guide this process but the ownership lies with the recipient of the feedback (and yes, they can choose not to take action but they should be clear about that and their reasons). Ask guiding questions like “What are our action items here?” or “How can we make sure next time you feel safe to talk about your blockers during standup?”.</li>
<li>Remember I said don’t generalize? Well if it’s a positive feedback it can actually help and encourage if you talk about patterns in the recipient’s behavior. “I’ve noticed that you give awesome presentations lately, for example this last time about Kubernetes….”</li>
<li>It’s completely OK to talk about your feelings in the situation you’re describing, just make sure you’re explicit about them being feelings and not facts. “When you interrupted me during my presentation last Tuesday I felt really disrespected and undervalued” (v.s. “You don’t respect me”).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-when">The when</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timely feedback is key. Give feedback as soon as you can - hopefully the same day the event that you’re giving feedback about happened. Why? First, both of you still have the context fresh in your minds, second, this way a mental connection is formed between action and reaction.</li>
<li>Unless you have good experience in it don’t give instant feedback. Make sure you give yourself some breathing space and time to consider how you want to deliver your message. This is especially true for emotionally loaded situations.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb praise publicly and criticize privately. Of course it’s completely OK to repeat praise in a private setting and rephrase/clarify it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, giving good feedback is as much about forming the habit as skills. Make sure you practice it, I guarantee you can find good occasions almost each day if you look closely.</p>

This section of the article expands on the comment I’ve made on the
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/experience-report-contributing-to-rust-lang-rust/12012/17?u=matklad">irlo</a>
a while ago.</p>
<p>Since a couple of months ago, I am slowly pivoting from doing mostly green field dev in the rust-analyzer’s code base to refactoring <code>rustc</code> internals towards merging the two.
The process has been underwhelming, and slow and complicated build process plays a significant part in this: I feel like my own productivity is at least five times greater when I work on <code>rust-analyzer</code> in comparison to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>Before I go into details about my vision here, I want to give shout-outs to
<a href="https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum/">@Mark-Simulacrum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mark-i-m">@mark-i-m</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jyn514">@jyn514</a>
who already did a lot of work on simplifying the build process in the recent several months.</p>
<p>Note that I am going to make a slightly deeper than “Rust in 20XX” dive into the topic, feel free to skip the rest of the post if technical details about bootstrapping process are not your cup of tea.</p>
<p>Finally, I also should warn that I have an intern advantage here — I have absolutely no idea about how Rust’s current build process works, so I tell how it should work from the position of ignorance. Without further ado,</p>
<div>
<h3 id="how-simple-could-the-build-process-be"><a href="#how-simple-could-the-build-process-be"></a>How Simple Could the Build Process Be?</h3>
<p><code>rustc</code> is a bootstrapping compiler.
This means that, to compile <code>rustc</code> itself, one needs to have a previous version of <code>rustc</code> available.
This <em>could</em> make compiler’s build process peculiar.
My thesis is that this doesn’t need to be the case, and that the compiler could be just a crate.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping does make this harder to see though, so, as a thought experiment, let’s imagine what would <code>rustc</code>'s build process look like were it not written in Rust.
Let’s imagine the world where <code>rustc</code> is implemented in Go.
How would one build and test this rust compiler?</p>
<p>First, we clone the <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repository.
Then we download the latest version of the Go compiler — as we are shipping <code>rustc</code> binaries to the end user, it’s OK to require a cutting-edge compiler.
But there’s probably some script or gvm config file to make getting the latest Go compiler easier.
After that, <code>go test</code> builds the compiler and runs the unit tests.
Unit tests take a snippet of Rust code as an input and check that the compiler correctly analyses the snippet: that the parse tree is correct, that diagnostics are emitted, that borrow checker correctly accepts or rejects certain problems.</p>
<p>What we can not check in this way is that the compiler is capable of producing a real binary which we can run (that is, <code>run-pass</code> tests).
The reason for that is slightly subtle — to produce a binary, compiler needs to link the tested code with the standard library.
But we’ve only compiled the compiler, we don’t have a standard library yet!</p>
<p>So, in addition to unit-tests, we also need somewhat ad-hoc integration tests, which assume that the compiler has been build already, use it to compile the standard library, and then compile, link, and run the corpus of the test programs.
Running std’s own <code>#[test]</code> tests is also a part of this integration testing.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see if the above setup has any bottlenecks:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Getting the Go compiler is fast and straightforward.
In fact, it’s reasonable to assume that the user already have a recent Go compiler installed, and that they are familiar with standard Go workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiling <code>rustc</code> would take a little while.
On the one hand, Rust is a big language, and you need to spend quite a few lines of code to implement it.
On the other hand, compilers are very straightforward programs, which don’t do a lot of IO, don’t have to deal with changing business requirements and don’t have a lot of dependencies.
Besides, Go is a language known for fast compile times.
So, spending something like five minutes on a quad-core machine for compiling the compiler seems reasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, running unit-tests is a breeze: unit-tests do not depend on any state external to the test itself; we are testing pure functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first integration tests is compiling and <code>#[test]</code>ing <code>std</code>.
As <code>std</code> is relatively small, compiling it with our compiler should be relatively fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running tens of thousands of full integration tests will be slow.
Each such test would need to do IO to read the source code, write the executable, and run the process.
It is reasonable to assume that <em>most</em> of potential failures are covered with compiler’s and <code>std</code>'s unit tests.
But it would be foolish to rely solely on those tests — fully integrated test suite is important to make sure that compiler indeed does what it is supposed to, and it is vital to compare several independent implementations — who knows, maybe one day we’ll rewrite <code>rustc</code> from Go to Rust, and re-using compiler’s unit-tests would be much harder in that context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>So, it seems like except for the final integration test suite, there’s no complexity/performance bottlenecks in our setup for a from-scratch build.
The problem with integrated suite can be handled by running a subset of smoke tests by default, and only running the full set of integrated tests on CI.
Testing is embarrassingly parallel, so a beefy CI fleet should handle that just fine.</p>
<p>What about incremental builds?
Let’s say we want to contribute a change to <code>std</code>.
First time around, this requires building the compiler, which is unfortunate.
This is a one-time cost though, and it shouldn’t be prohibitive (or we will have troubles with changes to the compiler itself anyway).
We can also cheat here, and just download some version of <code>rustc</code> from the internet to check <code>std</code>.
This will mostly work, except for the bits where <code>std</code> and rustc need to know about each other (lang items and intrinsics).
For those, we can use <code>#[cfg(not(bootstrap))]</code> in the <code>std</code> to compile different code for older versions of the compiler.
This makes <code>std</code> implementation mind-bending though, so a better alternative might be to just make CI publish the artifacts for the compiler built off the master branch.
That is, if you only contribute to <code>std</code>, you download the latest compiler instead of building it yourself.
We have a trade off between implementation complexity and compile times.</p>
<p>If we want to contribute a change to the compiler, then we are golden as long as it can be checked by the unit-tests (which, again, in theory is everything except for <code>run-pass</code> tests).
If we need to run integrated tests with <code>std</code>, then we need to recompile <code>std</code> with the new compiler, after every change to the compiler.
This is pretty unfortunate, but:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you fundamentally need to recompile <code>std</code> (for example, you change lang-items), there’s no way around this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you don’t need to recompile <code>std</code>, than you probably can write an <code>std</code>-less unit-test,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as an escape hatch, there might be some kind of <code>KEEP_STDLIB</code> env var, which causes integrated tests to re-use existing <code>std</code>, even if the compiler is newer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To sum up, compiler is just a program which does some text processing.
In the modern world full of distributed highly-available long-running systems, compiler is actually a pretty simple program.
It also is fairly easy to test.
The hard bit is not the compiler itself, but the standard library: to even start building the standard library, we need to compile the compiler.
However, most of the compiler can be tested without <code>std</code>, and <code>std</code> itself can be tested using compiler binary built from the master branch by CI.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="why-todays-build-process-is-not-simple"><a href="#why-todays-build-process-is-not-simple"></a>Why Today’s Build Process is not Simple?</h3>
<p>In theory, it should be possible to replace Go from the last section with Rust, and get a similarly simple bootstrapping compiler.
That is, we would use latest stable/beta Rust to compile <code>rustc</code>, then we’ll use this <code>rustc</code> to compile <code><code>std</code></code>, and we are done.
We might add a sanity check — using the freshly built compiler &amp; <code>std</code>, recompile the compiler again and check that everything works.
This is optional, and in a sense just a subset of a crater run, where we check one specific crate — compiler itself.</p>
<p>However, today’s build is <em>more</em> complicated than that.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, instead of using a "standard distribution" of the compiler for bootstrapping, <code>x.py</code> downloads custom beta toolchain.
This could and should be replaced with using <code>rustup</code> by default.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, master <code>rustc</code> requires master <code>std</code> to build.
This is the bit which makes <code>rustc</code> not a simple crate.
Remember how before the build started with just compiling the compiler as a usual program?
Today, <code>rustc</code> build starts with compiling master <code>std</code> using the beta compiler, than with compiling master <code>rustc</code> using master <code>std</code> and beta compiler.
So, there’s a requirement that <code>std</code> builds with both master and beta compilers, and we also has this weird state where versions of compiler and <code>std</code> we are using to compile the code do not match. In other words, while <code>#[cfg(not(bootstrap))]</code> was an optimization in the previous section (which could be replaced with downloading binary <code>rustc</code> from CI), today it is required.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, there’s not much in a way of the unit tests in the compiler.
Almost all tests require <code>std</code>, which means that, to test anything, one needs to rebuild everything.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, LLVM &amp; linkers.
A big part of "compilers are easy to test" is the fact that they are, in theory, closed systems interacting with the outside world in a limited well-defined way.
In the real world, however, rustc relies on a bunch of external components to work, the biggest one of which is LLVM.</p></div></div></div>

								<span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><em>A Logically investigation identifies a key QAnon figure as New Jersey resident Jason Gelinas. The investigation ties QAnon properties to a company owned by Gelinas, an information technology specialist who has held prominent positions at both Credit Suisse and Citigroup.</em></p>

<p><span>Ever since the shadowy figure known as Q made his first appearance on the 4chan imageboard in October of 2017, the author’s identity has remained a mystery. Since then, Q has posted thousands of ‘drops,’ converting legions of followers to the belief that Donald Trump is leading a global fight against a satanic cabal of child trafficking elites, commonly referred to in the QAnon world as the ‘Deep State’.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, Q’s posts would move from the 4chan forum to 8chan, and finally to its later iteration, 8kun. But these forums weren’t where most of Q’s followers would go to access the drops: most would find them neatly compiled on a site called QMap, now the main platform on which Q’s drops are published. For years it was believed that QMap was an endeavour that was independent of both the chan forums and the person or people posting Q’s drops, but recent discoveries concerning an IP address behind QMap raised questions as to whether Jim Watkins, the owner of 8chan and 8kun, an elusive figure in his own right, could also be Q. <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>As some QAnon researchers have pointed out</span></a>, however, the story of Q’s operations does not end with Jim Watkins.</p>

<p>In the world of QAnon, the site qmap.pub is something of a sacred text. It’s a site designed to collect Q’s posts on other message boards and collate them in a searchable database; over the years, it has grown to include glossaries on themes, profiles on people named across the drops (handily sorted into ‘Evil’, ‘Traitor/Pawn’, and ‘Patriot’), and even a prayer wall.</p>
<p>Most followers of QAnon tend not to visit Q’s posts on 8kun and the ‘chan’ boards where they are initially posted (the vernacular used on those sites is deliberately exclusionary and newcomers are often put off). This makes qmap.pub a crucial port of call for all QAnon information and a major node in how the movement disseminates its lore. The site&nbsp;has been hitting over 10 million monthly users since April of this year.</p>
<p>The developer of QMap has been known only as ‘QAPPANON’ since the launch of the site in May of 2018. They have a successful Patreon where they regularly post and update their following on the running of the website. They pull in over 600 patrons and a $3,320 a month income - although there is a $4,000 a month target for ‘running costs’ of the website. In addition to the website, QMap also had an accompanying app on the Google Play Store (for $2.99) until <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-removes-qanon-apps-from-play-store-for-violating-terms/"><span>it was removed in May</span></a> this year as “harmful content”. The user QAPPANON is synonymous with qmap.pub, acting as its sole developer and mouthpiece.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The QAnon community recognizes the importance of QAPPANON and how central QMap is to how the movement functions. In a recent campaign to deplatform QAPPANON from Patreon, QAnon power-influencer Praying Medic leapt to their defence, calling on his nearly 400,000 Twitter followers to help (and funnelling them towards QAPPANON’s Patreon). In addition, Praying Medic linked to the Patreon on his podcast, describing it as the “Qmap Patreon”.</p>

<h4><strong><span>Who is behind QAPPANON?</span></strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/who-is-qanon-jim-watkins-rumors/"><span>It has been suspected that the owner of 8kun, Jim Watkins, is Q</span></a> and perhaps QAPPANON. A shared IP address for 8kun and qmap.pub was viewed as a significant link between Watkins and Q, placing him as a figure doing more than just hosting Q’s preferred method of communication. If Watkins was not in fact Q, his hosting of QMap suggested that at the very least, he could “become Q whenever he wanted”. When approached by Daily Dot, however, QAPPANON stated “they are ‘not associated with Watkins’ and that they moved to VanwaTech because “QMap suffers denial of service attacks regularly, hence the need for a content delivery network that could stop it.”</p>

<h4><strong><span>Logically Investigation into QAPPANON’s identity</span></strong></h4>
<p>Our investigation can reveal that QAPPANON is not Watkins, but instead a New Jersey man in his forties with prominent roles in technical analysis and IT security for the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QAPPANON’s email address was initially discovered during our investigation into QMap’s translation efforts and international reach. A now-deleted Facebook post allowed us to trace the email to a CNET&nbsp;download cache for the QMap app as well as a new app in development called Armor of God.</p>

<p>The email found here in the URL serves as a point of contact in a call for translators for qmap.pub. Importantly, the post here states that “<strong><em>Q</em></strong> is looking for someone” rather than “QMap is looking for someone.” As Watkins’s connection to QMap has resulted in speculation that he could be Q, the connection here should not be ignored. However, this may be the result of Shirley_is believing that Q speaks through qmap.pub. What this post <em>does </em>indicate is that QAPPANON is directly responsible for hiring translators for QMap, and therefore has employees.</p>
<p>An extraction of QAPPANON’s email address from the URL led to their developer profile and list of created apps on CNET. While the qmap app is well known at this point, Armor of God is relatively new, having been uploaded on the 18th June 2020.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Armor of God:</strong></span></h5>
<p>When investigating Armor of God, we were met with a bare sign-up screen. Attempts to register and investigate the platform both on desktop and mobile versions were met with login errors and no email to confirm registration or change passwords. This led us to believe that, while downloadable on app stores, the platform is not yet up and running.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the “get the Android app” link led to the Google Play store. Here, we can see that QAPPANON is listed as the profile responsible for uploading the app.</p>
<p><br><span><img src="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=600&amp;name=AoGPlay.png" alt="AoGPlay" width="600" srcset="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=300&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 300w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=600&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 600w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=900&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 900w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=1200&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 1200w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=1500&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 1500w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGPlay.png?width=1800&amp;name=AoGPlay.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></span></p>

<p>However, further down, we can see a different entity listed as the developer of Armor of God: Patriot Platforms.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=226&amp;name=AoGDev.png" alt="AoGDev" width="226" srcset="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=113&amp;name=AoGDev.png 113w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=226&amp;name=AoGDev.png 226w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=339&amp;name=AoGDev.png 339w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=452&amp;name=AoGDev.png 452w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=565&amp;name=AoGDev.png 565w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/AoGDev.png?width=678&amp;name=AoGDev.png 678w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px"></span></p>
<p>Therefore, far from being a rogue developer creating QMap, QAPPANON has a company—and a company must be filed for.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Patriot Platforms LLC</strong></span></h5>
<p>Visiting Patriot Platforms’ <a href="http://patriotplatforms.com/"><span>website</span></a> reveals a plain splash page with a link to their support email.</p>

<p>From here, we also found a name, Jason Gelinas, after which we were able to narrow this down to Jason J. Gelinas in New Jersey, whose listed phone number correlates with the one belonging to Patriot Platforms LLC.</p>

<h5><span><strong>Jason J. Gelinas</strong></span></h5>
<p>Jason J. Gelinas, an information technology specialist from Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, whose CV lists prominent positions with both Credit Suisse and Citigroup, is the founder and sole employee of Patriot Platforms LLC, which is credited as the developer behind the QMap and Armor of God platforms. Gelinas’s home address is, in fact, a mere seven-minute drive from Patriot Platforms LLC’s listed P.O. box, also in Berkeley Heights; further investigation shows the connection between Gelinas’s personal WhatsApp and Patriot Platforms’ listed phone number.</p>

<p>The distance between property owned by Jason J. Gelinas and Patriots Platforms’ postal address (P.O.Box) is only a 7 minute drive.</p>
<p>Jason appears to be scrubbed from social media, with only a Flickr account left. The account name is jjgelinas77.</p>

<p>Crucially, echoes of Gelinas’ username “jjgelinas77” can be seen in the screenshots for Armor of God - “Board Owner <strong>@anon77</strong>” works as an app developer.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><span><strong>Relationship between Jason, Armor of God, QAPPANON</strong></span></h5>
<p><span><img src="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=546&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg" alt="Qmap next edit-1" width="546" srcset="https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=273&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 273w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=546&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 546w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=819&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 819w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=1092&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 1092w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=1365&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 1365w, https://www.logically.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg?width=1638&amp;name=Qmap%20next%20edit-1.jpg 1638w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></span></p>
<p>So does that mean Gelinas <em>is </em>Q? No. In fact, it’s quite unlikely that someone such as Gelinas would have been involved in the very early (i.e. 4chan) days of Q. It does suggest, however, that after the success of the QMap platform since it was launched in 2018, a direct line was opened between Watkins and Gelinas, as well as Q (if we are to believe that Q is actually an independent third party and whether the Q from the early days is the Q of today). Indeed, as <span>creator and former owner of 8chan </span>Fred Brennan told Logically, Watkins essentially operates Vanwatech, the company hosting both 8kun and QMap, meaning that he can offer Gelinas free or negligible running costs for QMap, which then reframes the monthly income from Patreon.</p>
<p>So how close is all this to Q? In a nutshell, it’s closer than we’ve ever been. In fact, recent Q drops discussing the ‘Armor of God’ prayer more and more frequently coincide almost perfectly with attempts to launch the ‘Armor of God’ platform, giving this the feel of a coordinated PR campaign. Of course, that could be down to the tendency among Q’s followers to use and re-use the same language, but given the established connection between Gelinas and Watkins, the fact that this timing suggests a level of coordination should not be dismissed.&nbsp;</p></span>

However, scientists at Nagoya University and colleagues in Japan recently found that the tobacco plant Nicotiana benthamiana promotes adhesion of tissue and can maintain grafts between a broad range of species.</p><p>Their findings, published recently in the journal <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.sciencemag.org%2Fcontent%2F369%2F6504%2F698&amp;t=YTYwYjU4ZGE0MDM5OTFkMWRkMzI4YTk1NmQxZWE5MTNlNWMwNDI4MyxLUkQyYlUzcA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F629086794241146880%2Fplant-grafting-enzyme&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1600187120">Science</a></i>, have also shown that using tobacco as an intermediary, the upper part (scion) of a tomato plant grafted onto the lower part (rootstock) of a Chrysanthemum morifolium (widely known as Florist’s daisy) successfully bore fruit.</p><p>Grafting has been conducted for thousands of years for the propagation of fruits and vegetables, in which a productive scion is attached onto a rootstock that is resistant to diseases and environmental stresses. However, exactly how grafts are established has been unclear, and grafting is considered difficult between different family species.</p><p>A team of scientists from Nagoya University, Teikyo University, RIKEN, Chubu University, and GRA&amp;GREEN Inc. (a start-up venture company from Nagoya University) recently conducted a study on grafting between different family species.</p><p>The team focused on Nicotiana in the Solanaceae family, because a previous study had shown that its scion can be grafted onto the rootstock of Arabidopsis thaliana in the mustard family. The team conducted grafting experiments using plants of seven Nicotiana species and their partners from 84 species in 42 families. The results showed that Nicotiana, used as either scion or rootstock, succeeded in maintaining grafts for more than a month with 73 species in 38 families.</p><p>Next, the scientists examined the cellular mechanisms that enable Nicotiana to form grafts with plants from a wide range of families. They analyzed transcriptomes at graft junctions between Nicotiana and Arabidopsis and hypothesized that the expression of β-1,4 glucanases secreted into the extracellular region is involved in cell wall digestion. In further experiments, when β-1,4 glucanases were overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the adhesion property of the grafts was enhanced. Thus, they concluded that the expression of β-1,4 glucanases is a key in facilitating tissue adhesion of the grafts.</p><figure data-orig-height="619" data-orig-width="663"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/082142bf46b3e14344cceee445b4bc75/4e015cafafd66f54-4c/s1280x1920/2fae36a6abac4368ff018bebe2676d7f003fee22.png" data-orig-height="619" data-orig-width="663" width="663" height="619" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Using tobacco as an interscion, a tomato scion was grafted onto a rootstock of Chrysanthemum (Florist’s daisy), one of the most prolific plants on land.Three monthslater, the tomato plant bore a small fruit.

  <article>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosions">August 4th explosions in Beirut</a> were very jarring to me due to the loss of human life, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNDhIGR-83w">numerous</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGEmD6j8diU">direct</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwRF5liTGB4">videos</a> that looked like something out my 80s youth nightmares. Hearing that it was caused by 2,750 tonnes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>, I started working on my phone to quantify my fear by figuring out how easy it would be to ship that much, and how much it would cost.</p>

<p>According to wikipedia, there were at least 171 deaths; 6,000 injuries; 300,000 people homeless; and US$10-15 billion in destruction with a blast radius causing damage up to two miles away. <sup id="fnref:nytimes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nytimes">1</a></sup></p>

<p>After my initial shock, I heard 2,750 tonnes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> mentioned in the news but didn’t know much about that and wanted to know how big that was. It surprised me that it seems to cost a little over half a million to buy and ship this much It ends up being really cheap, really common, and really small and that scared me by how simple of a risk this is for misuse. I’m hoping that anti-terrorism agencies are working to prevent this but since I didn’t see much coverage on this, I’m posting my notes here in case others were doing similar research.</p>

<p>If you can, please consider donating to help those impacted. Choosing a charity is hard, but I noticed that <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1291772262530637824">Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommended</a> <a href="https://www.seal-usa.org/BeirutEmergencyFund">Beirut Emergency Fund 2020</a>, a co-worker recommended <a href="http://www.redcross.org.lb/index.aspx?pageid=907">Lebanese Red Cross</a>, and Google has a nice <a href="https://donate.google.com/checkout?campaignid=5303526385319936&amp;tab=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;authUser=0">Donate with Google</a> page set up with the Center for Disaster Philanthropy.</p>

<p>This is unrelated to technology, but I think random researching outside of comfort areas is really important for design and debugging. Also, I think user empathy is really important for figuring out the solution so I frequently have to learn about whatever is important to my users. That being said, if this isn’t interesting, please skip.</p>

<h2 id="my-question">My question</h2>

<p>My initial wondering was “what is ammonium nitrite and how big is 2,750 tonnes of it?” And that led to a chain of reasoning that made me worry more and more…</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much space does 2,750 tonnes take up?</li>
  <li>How much space does that take up?</li>
  <li>How many shipping containers is that?</li>
  <li>How much would it cost to buy that much?</li>
  <li>How much would it cost to ship to that to a harbor near New York?</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing here was too complicated but it ate up part of Sunday morning while my wife and I were watching the news. I work on trying to collect references for lines of reasoning and so I started bookmarking some sites as I answered each of these questions.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-the-arithmetic">Breaking down the arithmetic</h2>

<p>There are many assumptions I made and I’m not experienced in chemistry or mining or export or shipping so I think that I’m likely quite a bit off in my calculations, so I figure I may be off by a power of 10. But that’s a big caveat before I start making naive calculations.</p>

<h3 id="how-big">How big?</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate">Ammonium nitrate</a> is commonly used as a fertilizer and as an industrial explosive. To figure out how much space this much would take up I want to multiply out by its density. According to wikipedia the density of ammonium nitrate is 1.725 grams / cm3, <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_am" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_am">2</a></sup> so to figure out how much space this takes up I need to convert this mass to a dimension.</p>

<pre><code>1 metric ton = 1,000,000 grams = 1,000 kilograms = 1 megagram
1,000,000 / 1.725 = 579710.144927536231884 cm3 = .5797 m3 = 20.47 cubic feet
2,750 * .5797 = 1594.175 m3
</code></pre>

<p><sup id="fnref:wikipedia_tonne" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_tonne">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So a single tonne of ammonium nitrate takes up .5797 m3 or 20.47 cubic feet.</p>

<p>Why did I convert that to cubic feet? I wanted to try to think of that in car cargo size and those are displayed in cubic feet.</p>

<p>So a BMW 330 Gran Turismo hatchback has a 18.4 cubic foot capacity with the seats up and 56.5 with the seats down. <sup id="fnref:bmw_330gt_cargo_specs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bmw_330gt_cargo_specs">4</a></sup> So it won’t fit a whole tonne with the seats up, but it can hold almost three with the seats down. Of course, the axles can’t bear even a half tonne so it’s moot for reality, but I’m now thinking of 2,750 tonnes in terms of hatchbacks.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/bmw-3-series-gt-rear-quarter.jpg" alt="Fortunately, not full of ammonium nitrate"></p>

<p>So, the entire batch of ammonium nitrate in Beirut takes up 1594 m3. That’s too big to think of in hatchbacks, how many shipping containers is that?</p>

<p>A shipping container, or an intermodal container, are those standard sized steel boxes that we see on trucks and stacked up in ports and is used for shipping pretty much everything for freight transport. They come in 20 foot and 40 foot versions and shipping is described in twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs. This is one of those funny situations where the standard is in imperial units (kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_code">tire sizes</a>) but the dimensions are 6.1m long, 2.6m high, and 2.9m wide and have an internal volume of 33.1 m3. <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_tfe" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_tfe">5</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>1594.175 / 33.1 = 48.16238670694864
</code></pre>

<p>So 2,750 tonnes takes up 48.16 TEU shipping containers. Still kind of hard to visualize. How many does one of those cargo ships carry? Is 50 containers a lot?</p>

<p>Modern container ships can carry over 23,000 TEUs. <sup id="fnref:wikipedia_container_ship" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wikipedia_container_ship">6</a></sup> So 50 containers is just a fraction of the overall cargo.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/loaded_container_ship.jpeg" alt="See if you can spot the .217% of the TEUs that contain 2,750 tonnes"></p>

<p>So I can kind of visualize 50 TEUs and the neat web site <a href="http://www.bluebulbprojects.com/MeasureOfThings/results.php?amt=1500&amp;comp=volume&amp;p=1&amp;sort=pr&amp;unit=cm">The Measure of Things</a> tells me that’s 3/4 the size of a hot air balloon.</p>

<p>So big, but not humongous. Certainly something that the Joker or Simon Gruber could arrange to ship with 25-50 semi trucks.</p>

<h3 id="how-expensive">How expensive?</h3>

<p>How much would this much cost? The price seems to vary depending on country, this chart from 2007 shows the cheapest price from Russia at $156/tonne. [^pricing] And the current retail price on Alibaba.com is $192-217/tonne. <sup id="fnref:alibaba_price" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:alibaba_price">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The world’s total output was 21.6 tonnes in 2017 and the top five producing countries were Russia (9.9M), Egypt (4.3M), Uzbekistan (1.4M), the US (1.4M), and Poland (1.3M).</p>

<p>So 2,750 seems like a purchasable amount. Assuming that the 2007 price from Russia is reasonable for a bulk price gets us to $429,000 as the raw cost of the material.</p>

<pre><code>156 x 2,750 = $429,000
</code></pre>

<h3 id="how-much-to-ship">How much to ship?</h3>

<p>So if a bad guy has 50 containers full of ammonium nitrate, how much does that cost to ship?</p>

<p>An explosion in any US port would be terrible, but just to estimate prices I calculated shipping it to the Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn, NY as a two mile radius from there would reach much of New York City.</p>

<p><a href="https://ship.freightos.com/">Freightos.com</a> shows that four quotes of 50 containers shipped from St. Petersburg, Russia (RULED) to New York (USNYC) range from $106,200-138,000 and will take 13-19 days.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So it seems like the total cost to purchase and ship 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate is $567,000. That seems way too cheap to cause so much damage.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/05/europe/lebanon-russian-ship-blast-intl/index.html">CNN</a>, the fertilizer was on a Russian ship called the MVRhosus and was bound for Madagascar when it stopped in Beirut.</p>

<p>This is one of those risks that I don’t know any way to practically cope with, so I have to trust that multiple government agencies are working every day making sure stuff like this doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>But if someone is working on a Bond script, or an Austin Powers script, this might eventually show up in a story.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-calculations-together">All the calculations together</h2>

<pre><code>$156 x 2,750 tonnes = $429,000
1,000,000 grams / 1.725 g/cm3 = 579710.144927536231884 cm3 = .5797 m3
2,750 tonnes * .5797 m3 = 1594.175 m3
1594.175 m3 / 33.1 m3/TEU = 48.16238670694864 TEU
$429,000 chemicals + $138,000 shipping = $567,000
</code></pre>

<h2 id="unanswered-questions">Unanswered questions</h2>

<p>Questions I didn’t find that definitely impact overall cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m not sure what mixture and ingredients are needed beyond raw ammonium nitrate.</li>
  <li>I’m not sure if stacked containers will result in a similar explosion.</li>
  <li>Not sure how much it costs to rent all those containers.</li>
  <li>St. Petersburg may not be the best shipping port from Russia.</li>
  <li>How hard it is to arrange customs forms.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2 days ago I subscribed to GitHub sponsors to fund my work on the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, and I already got <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/leoloso/">my first sponsor</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsors.png" alt="GitHub sponsors" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1510"><figcaption>GitHub sponsors</figcaption></figure><p>Following the example set by Caleb Porzio (who's making <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">more than u$d 100k/y doing open source</a>), I have decided to use the <a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware">sponsorware model</a> to fund my project. It works like this:</p><ul><li>Whenever I get 10 new sponsors (at u$d 14/m), I start developing the most up-voted feature from a special <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp/projects/2">"Sponsorware" list</a> (which I'm completing as I'm writing this milestone)</li><li>Once implemented, the new feature becomes available to all the sponsors, via a private GitHub repo</li><li>As soon as I get 50 new sponsors, the new feature becomes open source, accessible to everyone via the public GitHub repo, and is integrated into the plugin</li></ul><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/sponsorware-features.png" alt="Sponsorware features" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1120"><figcaption>Sponsorware features</figcaption></figure><p>In a few months, I will also start creating instructional videos, explaining how to make the most out of the plugin. According to Caleb, this is the biggest money-making strategy.</p><p>I have also decided to add a middle tier (at u$d 70/m), where I provide Slack-based personal support, to help users of my plugin set-up GraphQL with WordPress, troubleshooting, and answering their questions. A user needed help to develop a functionality, so he decided to sponsor me &lt;= my first sponsor ❤️</p><p>Finally, I added a higher tier (at u$d 700) for corporate sponsors. I plan to ask around in the WordPress community if their companies may be interested in participating. That would be a win-win: They get plenty of face from contributing to open source, and I get the certainty that I can make a living wage from my work and can focus on the development of the plugin (and not on marketing, which is not my forte).</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsor-projects.png" alt="My sponsors and sponsored projects" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1210"><figcaption>My sponsors and sponsored projects</figcaption></figure><p>I hope the sponsorware model works, and I can make a living while working on open source.

<blockquote><p>I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.</p><cite>Martin Luther King Jr.</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the disappointing aspects of race discussions in the media today, is that they predominantly focus on anecdotes and sensational examples. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outlookzen.com/2020/07/11/how-to-hack-the-human-brain/" target="_blank">Stories are wonderful at illustrating truths, but are a horrible way of proving them</a>. Is there a more quantifiable way of evaluating race relations in America today?</p>



<p>One objective metric that comes to mind, is rates of interracial marriage, normalized by society’s level of diversity. This single metric encompasses a wealth of different information – including housing/education/career segregation, societal attitudes towards embracing diversity, and close social ties that bridge racial divides. And most conveniently, interracial marriages and their resulting children are explicitly surveyed by a number of sources, such as the US Census. This makes it far easier to quantify them, as compared to more nebulous signals such as “friendships” and “social circles”.</p>



<p>One major disclaimer – it is certainly not my intention to embarrass anyone who is married to a partner of the same race. Indeed, the vast majority of people, regardless of race, marry someone of the same race. Often purely by coincidence. And other times because of people’s understandable desire to be with someone who shares their culture and world view – something often mentioned by people of color as well. The goal of this study is not to “call out” any individuals, but simply to examine wider societal trends.</p>



<h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>



<p>The best data source I could find was the US Census – specifically the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=DP05&amp;t=Race%20and%20Ethnicity&amp;tid=ACSDP1Y2018.DP05&amp;hidePreview=false" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a>. This survey provides racial demographic information, broken down by state and city. Unfortunately it doesn’t explicitly give us statistics for interracial marriage. But it does give us a different statistic which we can use as a proxy – the percentage of people who are biracial, broken down by each race-combination.</p>



<p>To be sure, this is a flawed proxy. Not all couples have the same number of children. Not to mention that the percentage of biracial individuals, is a lagging indicator of today’s rate of interracial marriages. These drawbacks make it very hard to use the metrics below in any absolute sense. But they are still of great value when used in a relative context.</p>



<p>The methodology we use to quantify racial integration is simple. In a world of complete racial integration, if X% of society is Black, then each person would have a X% likelihood of marrying someone who is Black. This implies that in a society that is:<br>– X% White,<br>– Y% Black,&nbsp;<br>we would expect <code><strong>2*X*Y/100</strong></code> % of individuals in the subsequent generation to be White-Black biracial.</p>



<p>Given the above, we can then score each society’s level of integration by computing the actual:expected biracial population ratio.</p>



<p>For example, in a hypothetical colorblind society consisting of 90 White and 10 Black citizens, each person would have a 10% chance of marrying a Black person. This implies that of the resulting 50 marriages, 9 of them (ie, 18%) would be White-Black. We would then expect 18% of children in the following generation to be White-Black biracial. If the actual biracial demographic is 1%, our racial integration score would be <strong><code>1/18 ~= 0.055 ~= 5.5%</code></strong></p>



<p>The above methodology has been coded into a software application, which parses the Census data and computes all the scores. <a href="https://gitlab.com/whacks/sandbox/-/blob/master/src/main/java/org/rajivprab/sandbox/census_analysis/Census.java">Both the code and the dataset can be found here</a>, and is readily available for you to modify and/or run directly.</p>



<h2><strong>Limitations</strong></h2>



<p>The above methodology has many weaknesses of course. Chief among them, it doesn’t take into account age. Ideally, we would be looking only at the 20-40 demographic, in order to best estimate the expected fraction of interracial marriages. And we should also be looking only at the 0-10 demographic, in order to estimate the actual fraction of recent marriages that are interracial. Or even better, we should be measuring directly the fraction of recent marriages that are interracial, without having to rely on any other proxy. In the absence of more precise data, we are forced to make do with the above approximations instead.</p>



<p>More fundamentally, in order to truly quantify segregation, we should be looking at all social ties – not just marriages. It is possible for an African-American couple to be perfectly integrated into society, with friends, neighbors and colleagues of all backgrounds, and this methodology fails to capture that.</p>



<p>Lastly, this study uses marriage as a proxy for social integration. But arguably, we should be looking at other measures such as wellbeing, societal attitudes, and levels of discrimination experienced. Just because someone is in an interracial marriage, does not mean that they feel comfortable and welcomed by the wider society around them. And the converse is true as well.</p>



<p>Given the above limitations, this study should definitely be supplemented with other studies that explore this topic from different angles. The absolute scores computed are of minimal use on their own. But when used in a relative manner to compare different communities, it gives us some very objective, quantifiable and data-driven insights.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was shocked by how much the states differed from one another. When looking at the states with the lowest scores, we see extremely low levels of interracial marriage. A mere 0.7% of people in Mississippi identify as White-Black biracial. Despite the fact that 58% of Mississippi is White and <strong>38%</strong> is Black. In contrast, New Hampshire has the <strong>exact same</strong> biracial demographic, despite the fact that <strong>less than 2%</strong> of people in New Hampshire are Black.</p>



<p>Looking at the states with the lowest scores, it seems to validate commonly held beliefs …</p></div></div>

<p>An excerpt from the Symbolics Genera Manual.</p>
<div>
<p><a name="t2"></a>Genera - The Best Software Environment Available</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>To all our new users: Welcome.</p>

</div>
<p>This conceptual introduction explains what your Symbolics computer is all about. We urge you to at least skim it before you start daily work with the system. We try here to summarize some of the "big picture" concepts in your new software environment; knowing about this framework will help you in learning its details more efficiently.</p>
<p>Most new users of Symbolics machines have worked on traditional time-sharing systems, such as VAX/VMS, or on microcomputers or conventional UNIX workstations. ("Genera Comparison Charts" shows some equivalents between these systems and Genera.) If you feel somewhat uneasy about learning how to use the most advanced software environment around, relax!</p>
<p>You don't have to learn everything at once in order to do anything - look at this as a long-term, incremental learning project. You don't have to learn everything by yourself. Our documentation and Genera itself are here to help you.</p>
<p>Genera and Symbolics Common Lisp dramatically increase your productivity and efficiency by providing many built-in software facilities (similar to library routines) that you would otherwise have to write yourself. Our edit-compile-debug cycle happens so fast that you are virtually editing, compiling, and debugging simultaneously. The editor, compiler and debugger are all resident utilities, available anytime, anywhere.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 1. Your view of Genera's command level.</p>
<p>Genera has no "command levels" or separate "command environments" - you can get there from here. You can move directly from any application to any other application, usually with just two keystrokes. You do not have to close one application to enter another. (See Figure 1.)</p>
<p>Many different activities, such as the editor and electronic mail, run at the same time in separate processes. That means you can move around the system from one application to another without affecting the state of other applications. For example, you can move directly from editing a file to reading online documentation to sending mail and back to editing the file.</p>
<p>To illustrate the basic environmental concept, suppose for a moment the house you live in were like a conventional software environment. The electricity would be in one room, the telephone in another, the heat in another, and the tap water in another. To access one facility, you would have to leave the other behind, moving back to a central access hallway that opened onto all the other rooms.</p>
<p>Suppose you were talking on the telephone in the telephone room. If you wanted to turn on the light in order to write something down, you would have to leave the telephone room, and go to the electricity room. If you then wanted to wash your hands, you would have to leave the electricity room and go to the water room. It would be unthinkable to use the heat, light, or telephone in the water room.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 2. House as Operating System. This house design has central heating, electricity in every room, and so on. That is, basic services are available or accessible in every context.</p>
<p>Continuing this analogy, with a house designed like Genera, you could access electricity, heat, water, telephone, vacuuming, and so forth, from every room (Figure 2)! As you will see when you learn more about Genera, you can access a Genera activity in many different ways as well.</p>
<p>In a conventional computer system, the operating system is the foundation and other separate software application programs are layered on top of the operating system. The command level (exec, monitor, or shell) controls access to the operating system's facilities as well as access to (invoking and terminating) the application programs (Figure 3).</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure3.gif" alt="Figure 3"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 3. Traditional operating systems require the user to interact with a command monitor in order to access applications and the facilities of the operating system.</p>
<p>Genera is your whole environment; it encompasses what you normally think of as an operating system as well as everything else - system commands and all other activities. From where you look at it, there is no "top-level" controller or exec.</p>
<p>All Genera activities are themselves Lisp functions, based on a pool of thousands of Lisp functions, all implemented in Lisp. Below those, it's just the hardware - you never need to deal with a lower-level internal implementation language.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure4.gif" alt="Figure 4"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 4. The Lisp Environment, consisting of all the function and data objects in virtual memory. Activities are just collections of functions and data.</p>
<p>Genera is intelligent. Its many processes can communicate with each other, and they all automatically share data. Genera keeps an internal record of the history of almost everything that happens in the system - command history, output history, process history, window history, and so on.</p>
<p>Histories make it possible to use previous output on a window as input to a command. The mouse can select a relevant piece of output anywhere on the screen because the history mechanism keeps track of the data object types of all the output. As a result, the reusable output is completely context-sensitive.</p>
<p>For example, clicking on a filename in a directory listing displays the contents of the file. When a command needs a filename argument, clicking on that same filename gives the file to the command as an argument. The meaning of the clicks is both context-sensitive and intuitive. You can scoop up a piece of output in one activity and enter it as input to another activity in a matter of seconds. With just a few keystrokes, you can find, modify, and reuse a command that you entered earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The key to Genera's intelligence is the sharing of knowledge and information among all activities. At any time, the collection of all the state of all the processes is called the environment (Figure 4). Any function running in any process can use any piece of data in the environment directly. You do not need laborious special-purpose protocols or intermediate files.</p>
<p>The entire software environment, in its pristine unused state, ready for booting, is saved on disk as a world. A world consists of all the Lisp objects (functions, variables, windows, processes, and so on) that make up the software environment. The world contains the fully initialized environment, ready to boot and use.</p>
<p>Genera doesn't draw any boundaries around itself. It is customizable and extensible by design. Unlike most software, it has an open architecture; you can change anything that is part of Genera. In fact, we encourage you to take advantage of this and to build your applications as extensions of Genera.</p>
<p>The extensibility of the system is possible thanks to both its modular design and its implementation, using highly flexible, object-oriented data structures called flavors. Any data object defined by a flavor or class can be customized or extended cleanly.</p>
<p>Object-oriented data structures are at the heart of symbolic processing because they allow abstract descriptions of data and operations in terms that fit well with the application. The data objects are essentially models of the real-world objects they are implementing. Thus programming uses a problem-solving vocabulary that matches the terminology of the problem domain.</p>
<p>Genera itself was designed to be extended in a number of different ways. You can set customizing variables and create simple files of personal initializations (called init files), or you can extend or replace parts of Genera itself in order to create your own special application.</p>
<p>When you write a program, it becomes an extension of Genera itself (Figure 5). What you do becomes part of the world and enriches the software environment. Because you have loaded a world into your own standalone machine, you can customize and extend the system without affecting the work of others. To get a fresh world, simply boot your machine again.</p>
<div><p><img src="http://lispm.de/images/figure5.gif" alt="Figure 5"><br></p></div>
<p>Figure 5. Your Programs Become an Extension of Genera.</p>
<p>To sum things up, its built-in features, open architecture, intelligence, and extensibility make Genera a new breed of software environment. Genera can help you perform tough software development tasks more quickly than you ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>As you delve deeper into the conceptual material in the next chapters, and then begin to get hands-on practice with Genera in the workbook, do not feel overwhelmed. You shouldn't put pressure on yourself to learn all about a revolutionary new software environment in a day or two. Take it easy. Try things out. Master a little at a time. Genera fosters an incremental approach in all things, including its own mastery.</p>
<p>Genera has amazing functionality and flexibility - often you can perform any task in any application in several different ways. But do not equate high flexibility and functionality with low usability! Genera is also ultimately the most usable software environment available. We want you to explore our functionality at your own pace. There is virtually no limit to the capabilities you will discover in Genera. And Genera will not place artificial upper limits on your creativity.</p>

<p>What's the central philosophy behind the evolution of computing in general and Genera in particular?
Free programmers from thinking about unnecessary details and they can accomplish more. The more abstractly they are allowed to think, the bigger and harder the problems they can solve.</p>
<p>Some major advances in the history of conventional computing were motivated by this philosophy:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Assembly language. To avoid having to program in ones and zeros, assemblers were invented and programmers were able to express instructions to the computer mnemonically.</p>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>
<p>Bis dahin wollen wir Ideen sammeln, wie wir zusammen die rC3 gestalten wollen.<br>
Was erwarten wir von einer Remote-Veranstaltung?<br>
Welche neuen Formate, Spiele und Easter-Eggs sind möglich?<br>
Was können wir beitragen?<br>
Und welche Fehler sollten die C3-Teams beim Planen vermeiden?</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jedes Input unter<br>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>When is it again?</h2>
<p>Save the date:<br>
December 27-30, 2020<br>
Online and in your local hackspace with your preferred infection community</p>

                  <h2>2020-09-10</h2>
                
                <section>
                    <p>As part of my day job at GitHub, I work on the <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic"><code>semantic</code></a> program analysis toolkit. It’s a lot of fun and a lot of Haskell: we clock around <span>17,000</span> lines of Haskell source, though at times it’s been as high as <span>29,000</span>. The project in total has around a hundred direct dependencies, and several hundred resulting indirect ones. Though initially we used <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to build <code>semantic</code>, we switched to <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/">Cabal</a> when it gained the ability to build within a sandbox.</p>
<p>With <code>cabal</code> and a clean build environment, <code>semantic</code> takes between twenty and forty-five minutes to complete. When optimizations are enabled, it can take on the order of hours, especially when rebuilding dependencies with optimizations. And this is fair! Haskell is a complicated language that takes serious computational power to compile. And though Cabal is a versatile and fast-improving tool, it isn’t perfect, especially when applied to large monorepos containing many subprojects. Issues we ran into include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little compositionality: though <code>common</code> stanzas in <code>.cabal</code> files cut down on repetition within a single file, it’s not possible to share settings or configurations across multiple files.</li>
<li>Suboptimal caching: due to the vagaries of Template Haskell, <code>cabal</code> is very conservative about caching files containing TH splices. This is correct behavior on <code>cabal</code>’s part, but grows tedious when innocuous changes cause rebuilds that we know are unnecessary. The third-party <a href="https://github.com/haskell-works/cabal-cache"><code>cabal-cache</code></a> ameliorated some of this on our CI boxes, but did not address the problem fully. Additionally, any modification to a <code>.cabal</code> file throws out its associated caches, even when doing something that shouldn’t invalidate existing caches, such as adding a new module.</li>
<li>Phasing restrictions: our build process involved generating Haskell data types from text files containing grammar descriptions, and it’s not generally possible to access project-local files during Template Haskell splices.</li>
<li>Scriptability: when dealing with large projects, it’s often very convenient to do some limited forms of iteration when specifying build configurations, and the pure-text format of <code>.cabal</code> files precludes this.</li>
<li>Reliable REPLs: in order to yield a REPL capable of loading files without first compiling the entire project, we required a complicated and brittle <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic/blob/master/script/ghci-flags">bash script</a>.</li>
<li>Convenience: compared to other languages in which you can just drop new source files and have them picked up by the compiler, <code>cabal</code> requires you to list them explicitly. While explicit is very often better than implicit, the case of adding a new module to a project is so common that editing <code>.cabal</code> files every time becomes tedious.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, living with hour-long CI cycles was not an indefinitely tenable situation. But I think the issue of long CI cycles goes deeper than mere inconvenience: I believe that we as software developers have an ethical duty to keep build times and CI times down. We live in a world where carbon emissions have created, at least in part, a climate so troubled that the west coast of the United States is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/us/fires-oregon-california-live-updates.html">a literal hellscape</a>, where island populations are being displaced due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/may/07/monbiot-climate-change-evacuation">rising sea levels</a>, and where <a href="https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/a-growing-digital-waste-cloud">cloud computing consumes more energy</a> than some entire nations; I’ve grown to find the thought of letting corporations’ Travis or CircleCI instances recompute thousands of pointless builds upsetting, upsetting in a way similar to the thought of said companies contaminating groundwater with industrial byproducts. To meaningfully change the way companies consume resources requires broad labor action; however, irrespective of when this action is taken, we as engineers have an opportunity and responsibility to be the agents of change.</p>
<p>I also believe that very few people<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Excluding Rust programmers, who get to use the truly excellent <code>cargo</code>, and who seem to be very happy with it.</span></span> are truly happy with their build tool. I certainly haven’t been, anyway. To name but a few: the shortcomings of <code>make</code> have been documented for longer than I’ve been alive; <code>xcodebuild</code> only works on macOS/iOS targets; <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> is powerful but has no interoperability with <code>cabal</code>. It’s hardly controversial to suggest that, given a large project, no build system will be perfect for all people. This faact doesn’t make the quest for a better build system useless, but should also inform the engineer-voice that demands perfection.</p>
<p>Wearied by hour-long builds, both on CI and locally, I looked around for alternative build solutions that might ease that weariness. I settled on <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, with the <a href="https://haskell.build/"><code>rules_haskell</code></a> toolkit designed by the fine folks at <a href="https://www.tweag.io/">Tweag</a>. I’m happy to report that the experience was brilliant: if it’s possible for a build system to produce joy, Bazel and <code>rules_haskell</code> do. What follows is a brief overview of the Bazel experience, and the process of porting a large, multi-project repository to support either <code>cabal build</code> or <code>bazel build</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest thing to wrap your head around when coming to Bazel from other build systems is that <em>everything</em> on which your build depends—source files, data files, package dependencies, vendored git repositories−must be specified explicitly in Bazel. It does not suffice for your build process to just look at a given file I know is present in the repository; if the target that I’m specifying depends on that file, it must be listed explicitly as a dependency. Dependencies, in Bazel parlance, are more than libraries or repositories: the set of dependencies, and the hashed contents of all these dependencies, are what tells Bazel when builds can be cached and when they can’t. This also goes for test targets: if your tests need to read from some corpus of fixtures, you’ll have to specify those fixtures as an explicit dependency so that they’re available at runtime. This can be an involved process, as sometimes you just want to access a file (come on, it’s <em>right there</em>, I found myself whispering), but the benefits also show up in testing: if your tests are deterministic (as they should be), Bazel is capable of caching your test results, and only rerunning them when the source <em>or the fixtures</em> change. Given that the full tests for <code>semantic</code> parsing take several minutes to run, this is a profound improvement, especially on CI.</p>
<p>Beginning a new Bazel project, or converting from Cabal, requires starting with the <code>WORKSPACE</code> file. The <code>WORKSPACE</code> specifies the root of the current project, downloads and sets up GHC, and is the only place where external dependencies—such as those downloaded from Hackage—are specified. Targets are specified per-project in <code>BUILD.bazel</code> files, each of which refers as needed to external dependencies defined in the <code>WORKSPACE</code>. The language used to specify these <code>.bzl</code> files is known as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html">Starlark</a>, and is a subset of Python that discourages mutability and iteration—though I’m hardly the world’s biggest fan of Python, I found Starlark very pleasant to use, as its chosen subset of Python is strict enough to disallow most of the things I find egregious. Once the <code>WORKSPACE</code> file is set up, the process of conversion becomes specifying per-project library and executable targets in the <code>BUILD.bazel</code> file present in each project within the monorepo.</p>
<h2 id="whence-cabal-dependencies">Whence Cabal Dependencies?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are several hundred direct and indirect dependencies across all subprojects in the <code>semantic</code> monorepo. Each of these dependencies has to be declared and made available as a build target, specified in the <code>WORKSPACE</code>. There are three options for specifying dependencies on Hackage projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify them all manually by downloading them with <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/repo/http.html"><code>http_archive</code></a> and <a href="https://api.haskell.build/haskell/cabal.html#haskell_cabal_library"><code>haskell_cabal_library</code></a>, doing so would be tedious beyond words, especially given that we’d have to declare dependencies for each package.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> expression language, in combination with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/rules_nixpkgs"><code>rules_nixpkgs</code></a> ruleset, and transform Nix derivations into Bazel targets.</li>
<li>Pin to a particular <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> release, specifying non-Stackage dependencies with a YAML file in the project root.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Nix has considerable merit, especially when corralling system dependencies, it’s still an unconventional choice in industry, and I deemed it politically unattainable to introduce not just one but two new frameworks for builds. As such, I chose to build against a Stackage release, especially given that we have no real system-level dependencies and that ninety percent of our dependencies are already present in Stackage snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="code-generation-it-matters">Code Generation: It Matters</h2>
<p>Because maintaining syntax trees by hand was much too onerous, my coworker <a href="https://twitter.com/aymannadeem">Ayman</a> swooped in and wrote Template Haskell splices that <a href="https://github.blog/2020-08-04-codegen-semantics-improved-language-support-system/">generate syntax types</a> from a <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a> JSON description of the grammar. This works well, but hinges on the ability to read said grammar descriptions from the filesystem. This was a fraught process in Cabal, relying on autogenerated <code>Paths_</code> modules providing access to files specified in the <code>data-files</code> setting in each project’s <code>.cabal</code> file, and only happened to work by accident: were <code>semantic</code> uploaded to Hackage, no one would be able to use it as a dependency, as <code>cabal</code> would be unable to find the required file. As it is, this happened to work because our downstream clients use a pinned Git hash in their <code>cabal.project</code> to pull in <code>semantic</code> as a dependency; because <code>cabal</code> checks out the whole repository in this case, the tree-sitter files happen to be in the correct place.</p>
<p>Bazel and <code>rules_haskell</code> take a more principled approach to this. Rather than calling pre-provided functions to determine the locations of these JSON files, we make the build system take care of finding them, by declaring that each language package has an explicit dependency on said file.

<p>I love coffee and <a href="https://iam.mt/working-on-side-projects/">side projects</a>. I wanted to solve a coffee related annoyance that I faced on a regular basis. This post is about how I built a Coffee Pot Monitor, to track the coffee level in a coffee pot, remotely, using a <em>Load Cell</em>, <em>HX711</em> amplifier, and a <em>Raspberry Pi</em>.</p>



<h3>The Annoyance</h3>



<p>Imagine yourself being busy with something important. You take a quick break to grab some coffee and walk over to the break room only to find an empty coffee pot.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/UH3hU3a.gif?w=700&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Oh, the horror</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There’s no way for me to know the amount of coffee left in the pot, without walking over to the break room and checking it out. The coffee pots we have at work are opaque. So, it’s not possible to know the amount of coffee left in the pot by looking at it.</p>



<h3>Initial Solution</h3>



<p>I came up with a solution to my problem. A camera mounted near the coffee pot would stream the video data to a Raspberry Pi. Using Computer Vision on this stream, I can identify when someone uses the coffee pot. When someone pumps the coffee from the pot, my algorithm decreases the coffee level in the coffee pot by a static value (one cup). A dashboard, which can be accessed via a URL, displays this data in realtime.</p>



<p>There’re several drawbacks to this approach. For starters, my algorithm assumes that every person pumps exactly one cup of coffee. Now, consider the case of an empty, opaque coffee pot. A person tries to pump coffee and realizes there’s no coffee left. In this case, my algorithm still decreases the coffee level by a cup even though no coffee is pumped.</p>



<p>To say the least, it is a convoluted approach. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/BMG5jW7.gif?w=700&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>I knew it was a convoluted idea. I wanted to build it anyway.</p>



<p>One fine day, I shared the idea with a friend from work, Rajesh. He liked the thought behind the project and suggested an improvement.</p>



<h3>Improved Solution</h3>



<p>Rajesh suggested using the coffee pot’s weight to calculate the coffee level. That was it. Suddenly, it became obvious. It’s a great way to track the volume of the coffee in a coffee pot. </p>



<p>The potential of the project got us both excited. We submitted the idea to the quarterly Hackathon at work. Long story short, we won the <strong>first</strong> prize for our implementation of this idea.</p>



<h3>Tools</h3>



<p>After some research, it became clear that we needed a <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075317R45/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_.9H7CbRN8RYPY">Load Cell</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075317R45/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_.9H7CbRN8RYPY"> along with a </a><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075317R45/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_.9H7CbRN8RYPY">Hx711</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075317R45/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_.9H7CbRN8RYPY"> load cell amplifier</a>. I immediately ordered it from Amazon along with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L16MXBF/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_tcI7CbJ5GEQV8">Raspberry Pi 3 B+</a>.</p>



<h3>Setup</h3>



<p>First, hook up the Load Cell to the HX711 as shown in the image below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1666" height="778" src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?fit=640%2C299&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?w=1666&amp;ssl=1 1666w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=768%2C359&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=1024%2C478&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=1568%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?w=1666&amp;ssl=1 1666w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=768%2C359&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=1024%2C478&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?resize=1568%2C732&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i2.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/load-cell-to-hx711.png?fit=640%2C299&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Connecting a Load Cell to a HX711 amplifier</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Next, connect the HX711 amplifier to Raspberry Pi as follows:</p>



<ul><li>VCC to Raspberry Pi Pin 2 (5V)</li><li>GND to Raspberry Pi Pin 6 (GND)</li><li>DT to Raspberry Pi Pin 29 (GPIO 5)</li><li>SCK to Raspberry Pi Pin 31 (GPIO 6)</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1036" height="1104" src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?fit=640%2C682&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?w=1036&amp;ssl=1 1036w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=768%2C818&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=961%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 961w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?w=1036&amp;ssl=1 1036w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=768%2C818&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?resize=961%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 961w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hx711-to-rpi.png?fit=640%2C682&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Connecting a HX711 to a Raspberry Pi</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>That finishes our hardware setup. Let’s move on to the software side.</p>



<p>We use the <a href="https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py">HX711 python library</a> in Raspberry Pi to read the Load Cell data from the Hx711 amplifier. Every three seconds, the Raspberry Pi posts the data to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>. A simple static HTML page serves as the dashboard by displaying the realtime data from Firebase.</p>



<h3>The build</h3>



<p>We need two pieces of wood. One of the pieces, acts as a base to place the coffee pot. The other acts as a stand for the Load Cell. These are placed on either sides of the Load Cell. In my case, a colleague of mine, Vijay, helped with cutting out these two pieces of wood.</p>







<h3>Architecture</h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="412" src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=700%2C412&amp;ssl=1" alt="Architecture" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?w=1434&amp;ssl=1 1434w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?w=1434&amp;ssl=1 1434w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1 1024w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/iam.mt/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/architecture-t4c.png?resize=700%2C412&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Data flow from Load Cell to the user’s browser</figcaption></figure>



<ol><li>The Load Cell reads the weight of the coffee pot</li><li>HX711 module amplifies the Load Cell data and sends it to Raspberry Pi</li><li>Raspberry Pi posts the data to Firebase</li><li>Firebase publishes this data to all the clients</li><li>The browser displays the updates</li></ol>



<h3>How it works</h3>



<p>There is a one time setup process. First, weigh the empty pot on the Load Cell. Let this weight be w1 (min). Next, weigh the coffee filled pot on the Load Cell. Let this weight be w2 (max). At any given point of time, the weight of the coffee pot ranges from w1 to w2.</p>



<p>Every time someone pumps (or pours) coffee from the pot, the weight of the coffee pot decreases. This data is published to all the clients using Firebase. It’s as simple as that.</p>



<p>Here’s the final product:</p>

<p>Here’s an animation of the dashboard getting updated in realtime:</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>The entire cost of setting this up is approx. <strong>$45</strong>. It’d be great if we could build this at a much lower price. That way, it can be more affordable and practical. I’ll soon open source the code behind the project and provide the GitHub link to the repository.</p>

      <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unlike the Terminator-like humanoids that may come to mind when you hear the phrase ‘killer robots’, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) can take many forms that are more like the weapons deployed today, such as drones, tank turrets, submarines, missile-defense systems, and sentry robots. The common thread pulling LAWS together is lethal autonomy: the ability for these weapons to select and engage with objects, including people or military targets, without human help.</li>
  <li>With AI and robotics technology rapidly advancing, experts are warning that so-called ‘killer robots’ (or more formally, LAWS) are just years, not decades, away from the battlefield. To date no country has deployed LAWS to the battlefield, although at least a dozen are developing them and the technology is advanced enough to do so.</li>
  <li>The US military is a world leader in the technical as well as ethical and legal development of killer robots. In 2012, it issued Directive 3000.09 codifying the rule that people hold the reins and retain meaningful control over the use of LAWS. Then, earlier this year the Department of Defense adopted a set of 5 ethical principles to guide the development and use of autonomous weapon systems.</li>
  <li>While the US is a leader in the area, the AI arms race is global: at least 12 nations have acknowledged that they are developing LAWS, and global spending on automated weapon systems is projected to reach $16 billion by 2025.</li>
  <li>The AI arms race is accelerating, because no strong state wants to tie its military’s hands from using powerful technology by agreeing to an international ban. Despite warnings that killer robots are driving a third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons, states and international institutions are struggling to agree on how to regulate LAWS, if at all. Diplomats have been meeting at the UN for six years to discuss killer robots, but little progress towards a ban, treaty, or arms control agreement has been made.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For many people, “killer robots” bring to mind dystopian images from science fiction, such as the human-like androids of <em>Bladerunner</em> or Arnold Schwartzenegger’s intimidating Terminator robot. While such robots that are frequently portrayed in the media are still entirely fictional, real-world “killer robots” — or more formally, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) — are very much in the process of being developed. LAWS are systems that can select and fire on targets without human help, and prototypes exist in a range of weapons and military vehicles, including drones, submarines, tank turrets, missile-defense systems, and stationary sentry robots. While such systems are not widely deployed yet, many governments are actively developing such technology, so it is crucial to consider its implications and necessary restrictions for it now.</p>

<p>In fact, in 2015 more than 3000 experts signed <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/?cn-reloaded=1">“Autonomous Weapons: an Open Letter from AI &amp; Robotics Researchers”</a>, which warned that “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.” They specifically warned of the dangers of the uncontrolled spread of LAWS — likening them to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/worlds-deadliest-inventor-mikhail-kalashnikov-and-his-ak-47-126253">Kalaknishkovs</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> of the 21st century. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33686581">Researchers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786080/united-nations-un-autonomous-killer-robots-regulation-conference">diplomats</a> have warned that LAWS <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2016-09/features/stopping-%E2%80%98killer-robots%E2%80%99-why-now-time-ban-autonomous-weapons-systems">pose a destabilizing threat</a> to the international order with five core risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lowering the threshold for conflict because fewer lives are at stake;</li>
  <li>carrying out assassinations anonymously and remotely;</li>
  <li>amplifying terrorist attacks; - subduing populations or selectively killing a particular ethnic group; and</li>
  <li>locking competing algorithms into loops of conflict escalation — possibly nuclear conflict — without a person being able to break the cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these warnings, 30 global arms manufacturers <a href="https://qz.com/1746154/lacking-regulation-firms-on-track-to-make-killer-robots-reality/">have been identified</a> by the peace nonprofit Pax <a href="https://www.paxforpeace.nl/media/files/pax-report-slippery-slope.pdf">to be actively developing LAWS</a>.</p>

<p>Few laws exist to constrain the use of killer robots. At the international level, no law or policy deals specifically with LAWS or other automated systems. However, since this technology will be used by the military to kill, certain international rules and rights apply that restrict all weapons of war; like any weapon, these technologies are governed by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/killer-robots-and-the-laws-of-war-1383521594">the laws of war</a> and the use of force, which state that no weapon can be used to kill civilians indiscriminately or without a clear military objective behind the strike. However, experts stress that LAWS may lower the threshold to conflict and cannot be guaranteed to accurately discriminate civilians from soldiers, so the laws of war and use of force rules do not adequately address the threat LAWS pose. A treaty or arms control agreement constraining the use of LAWS, they argue, is necessary.</p>

<p>Despite the growing danger of LAWS being unleashed on the battlefield, diplomats <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-rights-killer-robots/nations-dawdle-on-agreeing-rules-to-control-killer-robots-in-future-wars-idUSKBN1ZG151">are still scrambling</a> at the United Nations (UN) to ban or bring LAWS under an arms control agreement. But, major powers, including the US, China, and Russia, are blocking progress towards a framework of any kind. In this piece, we’ll survey the state of killer robots (or, LAWS), as well as current efforts on their regulatory framework.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-killer-robots">What are “killer robots”?</h2>

<p>In the Terminator movies, John Conner is on a mission to save the world from a terrible future: the US military’s AI system, Skynet, becomes self-aware, starts a global nuclear war, and then builds an army of robotic soldiers to finish killing off mankind. These robot soldiers make their evil intent clear, marching with rifles in hand and radiating malevolence from their red eyes. In real life, however, spotting a “killer robot” is not so simple.</p>

<p>AI’s general-purpose nature may be attractive to the military, but it also makes pinning down what exactly is a killer robot complicated. The common thread pulling them together is lethal autonomy, although the specific weapon is different in each case. But, defining autonomy in LAWS is more complicated than it seems. Drones, for example, display levels of autonomy ranging from none (human piloting it and selecting and firing on targets), partial (flying autonomously but a person selects targets), to total independence from human operators. Plus, the term LAWS can describe a variety of possible weapon systems, from sentry robots and other self-defense systems to offensive ones like drones and wingmen for fighter pilots. As Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence and expert on its military applications, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18691459/killer-robots-lethal-autonomous-weapons-ai-war">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When people hear ‘killer robots,’ they think Terminator, they think science fiction, they think of something that’s far away […] Instead, it’s simpler technologies that are much nearer, and that are being prototyped as we speak.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While AI and robotics have made rapid progress over the past decade, the technology is still <a href="https://www.ausa.org/articles/changing-way-soldiers-fight-and-survive-ai-battlefield">too limited</a> to replicate everything a human soldier can do. Machine learning algorithms are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/greedy-brittle-opaque-and-shallow-the-downsides-to-deep-learning/">brittle, biased, and vulnerable</a> to both hacks and a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/">more subtle kind</a> of manipulation called <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/8/18297410/ai-tesla-self-driving-cars-adversarial-machine-learning">adversarial attacks</a>. Likewise, robots in the field struggle to move like soldiers do, communicate with them by listening to commands and reading body language, and distinguish between enemy soldiers and civilians. What machines are good at is automating specific tasks a soldier might do. Keeping watch, collecting and analyzing information, monitoring the battlefield, driving a tank or targeting and shooting at people — these are areas where AI is making its impact on war.</p>

<p>Just in the US, for example, nearly every branch of the military is developing LAWS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Army is building a 50-mm turret called <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/06/army-to-test-robotic-gun-bruce-jette/">Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System</a> (ATLAS) to put on tanks. ATLAS can autonomously detect targets, determine if they are hostile, and train its cannon on them with superhuman speed and accuracy.</li>
  <li>The Navy has installed an automated version of its Aegis missile system that reacts faster than humans can to shoot down incoming missiles or manned targets. The branch has also <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dsei/2019/09/10/the-us-navy-just-had-a-major-breakthrough-with-autonomous-weapons/">sailed a ship</a> from California to Hawaii and back without human help.</li>
  <li>The Air Force is a pioneer in developing lethal autonomy in drones. It has flown an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/pentagon-artificial-intelligence-terminator.html">autonomous version</a> of the infamous Predator drone that can track and kill targets as well as <a href="https://www.airforcemag.com/article/the-looming-swarm/">shown off swarms</a> of small drones that can communicate with each other and act collectively. Pushing automated lethality to its limits, the Air Force has gone as far as to propose pairing fighter pilots with robot wingmen to fly and fight alongside them. The Predator drone has been at the forefront of the unmanned system revolution in the military; one modern warfare expert Peter Singer has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/11/19/losing-humanity/case-against-killer-robots">described it</a> as “merely the first generation—the equivalent of the Ford Model T or the Wright Brothers’ Flyer.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> In August, foreshadowing an evolution in drones that will take them beyond being the Model T, an AI-powered fighter pilot <a href="http://ford/">beat</a> a human pilot in a series of simulated F-16 dogfights.</li>
  <li>The US is projected <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">to spend</a> $17.5 billion on drones between 2017-2021, including 3,447 new unmanned ground, sea, and aerial systems despite already owning 20,000 autonomous vehicles. Each branch is adapting autonomy to fit their needs. In the air, sea, and on land, the development of LAWS is transforming how the US military fights.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the US is a leader in developing the building blocks of killer robots, it is not alone in its pursuit of LAWS. Global military spending on automated weapon systems and AI, narrowly defined, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">is projected</a> to reach $16 and $18 billion respectively by 2025. At the latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/09/killer-robots-pressure-builds-for-ban-as-governments-meet">count</a>, “at least 381 partly autonomous weapon and military robotics systems have been deployed or are under development in 12 states, including China, France, Israel, the UK, and the US. …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> a lot because I like to read books and want to find more books to read. This morning I was reading a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24451428">thread on hackernews</a> on <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">Sarah Manavis’s NewStatesman article</a> and it reminds me of how much I want, I yearn, for useful book recommendations. I think about this pretty much every time I open the goodreads page or app and hope that maybe this is the day they finally fix recommendations, so I figure I would capture some ideas I have for fixing their recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="i-love-goodreads">I Love Goodreads</h2>

<p>First, I love Goodreads. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9499790-brian">profile</a> says I joined May 2012. But I think that’s just whenever I started this profile and I have multiple, old profiles that I can’t find. My memory says I started using them soon after launch, but maybe I’m misremembering. But I’ve used them for a long time because I like to read books. I love browsing bookstores and libraries looking for new books. I experience joy finding a 50 or 100 year old book that I didn’t know about. One of my favorite things is reading a book so good that I can’t go to bed, or want to walk an extra mile. But that’s pretty rare for me, I’m lucky if I get one of those a year.</p>

<p>I have goodreads on my <a href="http://prepend.com/stack.xml">link stack</a> with the tag <a href="https://www.prepend.com/future/technology/2020/01/purdah.html">“purdah”</a> that I think means it is part of the stuff I do that uniquely identifies me.</p>

<p>Any time I get a recommendation from a friend or article or wherever, I add it to my “to read” shelf on goodreads. That helps me when I’m trying to buy a new book. So at least I can read through the 245 books that at least a past me wanted to read. This works well and is better than a vanilla list.</p>

<p>I also like seeing what my friends read and especially what they like or dislike. My friends have different tastes so it’s not as simple as just reading everything they read, but it helps a little. It’s one of the few places that I think facebook helps because at least I get to find out facebook friends who also are on goodreads. Every once in a while I find a new book through this feed, maybe once every 2 years. This might be because I don’t have many friends on goodreads (only 42), but I think it’s also because different people have different tastes in books.</p>

<p>I also like that goodreads will tell me when an author I’ve read releases a new book, or is having a book chat or something. Although I wish they would tell me when they come to a local book signing.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-as-i-see-it">The Problem As I See It</h2>

<p>This gets me to what I think is wrong and want to fix. I have read and rated 802 books with my average rating of 3.97. This makes sense as I’m probably only going to read books I think I’ll like, but I think this is the average goodreads rating, not the average of my ratings. Looking at what I rated, I’ve only given out 3 one stars, 42 two stars and tons of five stars. I keep scrolling on and on.</p>

<p>The user interface for goodreads is pretty bad- information is hard to find, layout is wasted, search doesn’t work well, hard to tell ads from user content- but that’s not what I’m talking about here. The main problem is in finding books that I will like. Maybe a UX overhaul from a great designer would help, but not that much. A craigslist interface would be great if they could just solve this one problem…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the single book that I will love most in all the world?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to find the next amazing experience. Books are great because they are cheap and portable. It’s not like wine where the best is more than I’ll ever pay. Or travel where a first class flight can cost $20k. If I can find a book, I can read it. And maybe someone I know can read it too.</p>

<p>If I can mix in more wonderful books, my life will be better. My family’s life will be better. Etc etc. Maybe this is the answer to world enlightenment. Probably not, but it will be great, I think.</p>

<p>When I click on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/recommendations">recommendations</a>, goodreads shows me five books that I don’t want to read. And it’s weirdly bad. Some of it makes since why it’s bad. They recommend different versions of books I’ve read. They recommend two different versions of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (one of my favorite books), but I guess they don’t know these are the same book. That’s just a waste of time and it’s weird that amazon isn’t smart enough to avoid duplicative books.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/goodreads_recommendations.png" alt="Screenshot of goodreads recommendations page"></p>

<p>But then they recommend stuff like Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>. This is perplexing because I only have one book that goodreads knows I’ve read from King and I rated it two stars. I don’t have any of his books in my “to read” list. Why would they recommend this book? Two of my friends rated it four stars and one even wrote a recommendation. So maybe that’s why. I’m aware of this book and don’t want to read it. But other books like <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight has no relationship to me. Why would they recommend this? I also know about this book and don’t want to read it. I wish there was some way to note books that I don’t want to read. Then at least they would stop showing me the same book over and over.</p>

<p>So it seems like goodreads is making pretty basic, rules-based recommendations. And they don’t help me pick new books.</p>

<h2 id="my-perfect-wish">My Perfect Wish</h2>

<p>My idea for an 11-star experience <sup id="fnref:brian_chesky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:brian_chesky">1</a></sup> in finding new books is that Goodreads knows me even better than I know myself and constantly recommends the perfect book. They recommend books that teach me, that spark enlightenment, that I hate but teach me to appreciate other books, books for when I want to be happy, and books for when I need to be sad. I want something like Jane from Ender’s Game who experiences everything I know but is fixated on finding me a good book. So the output of a book sommelier whose passion is seeing me sit there and love a book.</p>

<p>That’s what I would like.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-story-about-jeff-bezos">A Little Story About Jeff Bezos</h2>

<p>Once I was lucky enough to go to TED. It was great on so many levels, I highly recommend it and 2/3 of the cost was tax deductible. It was full of great stuff. I got to wait in the registration line in front of Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer, that was neat.</p>

<p>Anyway, one night Neil Gaiman was doing in a midnight ghost story reading in some neat four story townhouse type building <sup id="fnref:vancouver_club" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vancouver_club">2</a></sup> that was totally empty and spooky and a great place for the event. The reading was on the top floor and there was a huge crowd waiting for the single elevator in this place. The lights were off and there weren’t any staff around so it was maybe 100 people waiting to go up three at a time. So I looked around the corner and took the stairs. About 2 or 3 other people had the same idea so we started racing up the stairs to get to the top and avoid the crowds.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/vancouver_club.jpg" alt="Vancouver Club street view">
<em>photo by <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/2-joe-fox">Joe Fox</a></em></p>

<p>This building was awesome. It seemed 100 years old, rare in Vancouver, and as we went up the stairs we saw each floor. The stairwell opened up to a big room that could probably seat a 50 person wedding dinner. The lights were off, and someone had opened a few windows and the white, wispy curtains were blowing with a little breeze. Even though it didn’t feel like a breeze. I said “cool, haunted house” and stopped climbing the stairs to look around. The person next to me said “yeah, cool” and we started quickly running around checking out the empty room. We did this on the third floor too and me and this random person did quick 60 second explorations of this spooky house.</p>

<p>It all happened quickly. Maybe 3 minutes to go up the stairs, run around each floor, and get to the top. About halfway through I realized this random dude was Jeff Bezos. I thought that was neat. I’ve bought books from Amazon since 1995 and I’m pretty sure I telnetted into it to order some books (although maybe that was cdnow before they bought them), so it was cool to think that Jeff Bezos likes haunted houses and still likes exploring empty buildings.</p>

<p>We got to the top and went into the venue and were maybe the first 10 people. Comically got there maybe after two or three elevators full of people. We went to the front where Gaiman was setting up at the podium. I got a comfy chair right in the front about five feet in front of Gaiman. Jeff Bezos sat in the chair to my left. The chair on my right had Neil’s wife, Amanda Palmer, who was carrying a ukelele case. I didn’t know it was a ukulele case until she told me. She also said she might play, but she didn’t.</p>

<p>Gaiman finished setting up and came up to talk to Bezos. Bezos asked if Gaiman got the books he sent. Gaiman said he did and they were really great and he enjoyed reading them. It seemed like this was the most recent in a series of book shipments.</p>

<p>Aside from nerd joy from getting to witness this small talk of people who interest me, I thought, at the time and many times since,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How cool is it that Neil-freaking Gaiman is still finding new books that are great, and how cool would it be to get book recommendations from Jeff Bezos. I bet he has access to the best book recommendations in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, TED has something called the “TED book club” where they mail you this box of books a month before the conference. This was the closest I’ve come to my dream. They maybe sent 10 and 5 are still on my bookshelf. But not the shelf behind me, so I don’t remember them specifically. I’ll look them up one day.</p>

<p>That’s probably better than Jane making recommendations. Amazon had just bought goodreads a year earlier and I was hopeful that any day, goodreads would roll out a wonderful recommendation engine any day now.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-to-fix">What I Want to Do to Fix</h2>

<p>What I would like to do is to just get a data dump of mine and everyone on goodreads recommendations. I don’t need to know the identities, just to know what recommendations go with what individual. It would be neat to protect privacy and find individuals to potentially follow them on goodreads, but I think for the analysis I want to do, I don’t need to know the actual identities.</p>

<p>I think if I have this data, I could try to find people who rate a few hundred books like I have, then look at what books they’ve read the most, or books that they’ve rated highest. I think that would be a good signal that I might like it.</p>

<p>It would also be cool to see …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Let’s say you share an interesting post with your friend. You’re excited to know what they think about it. They say, “I’ll check it out!” but you never hear them talk about it later.</p>



<p>Similarly, in marketing, you email your blog links to your prospects/customers, expecting them to open, click, and read it. And when the open and click rates are incredibly low, you’re upset.</p>



<p>Well, let me break the news to you.</p>



<p>We’re all busy people.</p>



<p>Most of us have not mastered the art of prioritizing and managing our work well. So if your friends or customers don’t engage with your’ knowledge dump’, don’t be upset. Instead, try to help them. We can do this by being mindful of the reader’s time.</p>



<p>So, the next time you email your blog or video links to your customers, share an&nbsp;<strong>excerpt</strong> of the content&nbsp;to sell its&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;along with the&nbsp;<strong>reading time</strong>. </p>



<p>When the reader knows they’ll have to spend x minutes on consuming your content, it signals two things:</p>



<ul><li>they will appreciate the fact that you’re&nbsp;<strong>mindful of their time</strong></li><li>if the&nbsp;<strong>reading time is short</strong>, they’re more<strong>&nbsp;</strong>likely<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to<strong>&nbsp;click</strong>&nbsp;and read it</li></ul>

<p><span><span>Broadly speaking, a spiral curve originates at a central point and gets further away (or closer) as it revolves around the point. Spirals abound in nature, being found at all scales from the whorls at our finger-tips to vast rotating spiral galaxies. The seeds in a sunflower are arranged in spiral segments. In the technical world, the grooves of a gramophone record and the coils of a watch balance-spring are spiral in form.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Spiral Equations</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In polar coordinates, the radial distance <i>r</i> ( <i>θ</i> ) from the central point is a monotonic function of the azimuthal angle <i>θ.</i> There are several canonical spiral forms. The simplest is the Archimedean spiral, <i>r = a θ</i>. This is generated by a point moving with uniform speed along a ray that is rotating with constant angular speed. Since the points of intersection with a fixed ray from the origin are evenly spaced with separation 2 <i>π a</i>, it is also called an arithmetic spiral (left panel of figure above). It was described by Archimedes in his work <i>On Spirlas</i>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>More generally, we consider <i>r</i><sup><i>k</i></sup><i> = a</i><sup><i>k</i></sup><i> θ</i>. For <i>k</i> = 2 we get Fermat’s spiral <i>r = a </i><i>√</i><i> θ</i> (centre panel of Fig). For <i>k</i> = –1 we have <i>r = a </i><i>/</i><i> θ</i>, which is a hyperbolic spiral (right panel of Fig).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An equiangular spiral is such that every ray from the origin cuts it at the same angle. Its equation is <i>r = a</i> exp (<i> b</i> <i>θ</i> ). Since <i>b</i> <i>θ</i> = log (<i>r / a</i> ), it is also called a logarithmic spiral and, since the intersection points with a fixed ray form a geometric sequence, the name geometric spiral is also used. Christopher Wren observed that many sea-shells, such at the <em>Nautilus</em>, have logarithmic spiral cross-sections.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><b>Involutes</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Suppose you wish to cut the grass. Here is an easy way:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Erect a stout column in the centre of the lawn;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Tie the mower to the column with a long rope;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Start it so that it winds inward in a spiral arc;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Relax and enjoy the magic of the <i>automower</i>.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The curve traced by the mower looks like an Archimedean spiral. It is actually slightly different: it is the involute of a circle (namely, the circular cross-section of the central column). The column should be chosen to have circumference 2 <i>π a </i><i>= D </i>where<i> D </i>is the blade diameter of the mower.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the column is described by the equations</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>x = a </i>cos <i>θ</i> ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>y = a</i> sin <i>θ</i> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>where <i>a</i> is the radius of the circle, then the curve traced out by the mower is</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>x = a </i>( cos <i>θ</i> + <i>θ</i> sin <i>θ</i> ) , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>y = a </i>( sin <i>θ</i> – <i>θ </i>cos<i> θ </i>)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The radius vector is <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> ( 1 + <i>θ </i><sup>2</sup> ) . For <i>θ</i> = 0 we have <i>r = a</i>, whereas, for the Archimedean spiral ( <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> <i>θ </i><sup>2</sup> ) we have <i>r</i> = 0 when <i>θ</i> = 0. The two curves are close, but not identical:<br>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral">
                Line integrals</a> measure the extent to which a path agrees with a vector (directional) field.
                This provides an easy way to implement handwriting/tracing/gesture recognition.
                Although not as accurate as fancy ML methods, it still can recognize a wide
                varation in drawings with good accuracy and is versatile in application.
                However, this would not work for OCR applications as the direction of the strokes is an essential component of recognition.
           </p>

            <p>
                The line integral and total length of the path both contribute
                to the scoring. This allows "5" and "8" to be distinguished.
                The centroid of the path is used for adjusting position.
            </p>


            <p>
                Try drawing a number (1-9) in the box to see if it detects it.
            </p>

            
            <canvas id="main-canvas" width="220" height="220"></canvas>

            

            <p>
                To make a new glyph:
                </p><ul>
                    <li> Clear the Canvas </li>
                    <li> Hold <b>SHIFT</b> and draw the character 5-8 times.
Try to keep the position the same as before. Naturally you will add a little variation.

                    </li><li> Optional: Press smooth a few times, then redraw a few more times. </li>
                    <li> Type in the string your glyph represents and <b>Save</b>.</li>
                </ul>

	<div>
		<p>The idea of trade-offs is familiar to everyone. None of us have unlimited money, time, or energy. We make decisions every single day&nbsp;about how to spend our money, our time, and our energy. Do I buy the red shirt or the blue shirt?&nbsp;Do I watch the football game or go to the concert?&nbsp;Should I ride my bike to work or hope I can find a good parking place?&nbsp;Do I call a plumber or try and fix the sink myself? Do I want the&nbsp;chili or the pasta? All of these decisions have costs (and hopefully benefits); some financial, some social — and some digestive.</p>
<p>Similarly, farmers face production decisions almost every day. Farming is complex. Just about every decision&nbsp;made on&nbsp;a&nbsp;farm will send ripple effects throughout the entire system;&nbsp;these&nbsp;decisions will influence the cost/benefit ratio of many future decisions. This complexity makes it difficult to make rapid changes, and is a major reason why many <a href="https://grist.org/food/farmers-dont-try-new-things-because-its-too-risky-this-could-change-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">farmers tend to be pretty conservative in their farming decisions</a>. Even if a farmer wants to try something new (a new technology, or a new crop, for example), that option&nbsp;may be precluded&nbsp;by decisions that were made last year, or even many years ago.</p>
<p>Weeds are a fact of life for farmers around the world, and weeds&nbsp;influence&nbsp;many of the decisions farmers make, either directly or indirectly. If we simply ignored weeds, we could expect <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.657.5813&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world food production to decline by 20 to 40 percent</a>. Sure, a farmer could decide to do nothing about the weeds. That would be a trade-off; letting&nbsp;the weeds grow will reduce crop yields. It is almost always going to be better to do&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;to manage weeds than to lose a huge percentage of the crop. But now the farmer must&nbsp;decide&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;to do to control the weeds. Remove them by hand? Till them? Burn them? Alter the crop planting date to disfavor the weeds? Rotate crops to help keep the weeds from building up over time? Harvest the crop early to avoid weed seed production? Spray a herbicide? Which herbicide? On every farm I know of, farmers don’t just just choose one of these things, but a combination of <a href="http://thefanningmill.com/2015/05/27/infographic-weed-control-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several to many practices</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 years, one of the most common choices made by farmers around the world has been&nbsp;to include the herbicide glyphosate (commonly known as Roundup) in their weed management program. That choice has placed glyphosate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.startribune.com/monsanto-weed-killer-roundup-is-huge-seller/367395791/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the news again</a>. A <a href="http://www.enveurope.com/content/28/1/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper&nbsp;from Charles Benbrook</a> declares that nearly 19&nbsp;billion pounds of&nbsp;glyphosate have been applied worldwide&nbsp;since 1974, and that&nbsp;it has become&nbsp;“the most widely applied pesticide” in history. It is&nbsp;difficult to argue that the increase in glyphosate use since its discovery has been pretty remarkable. And to be honest, such a dramatic increase in any single&nbsp;herbicide&nbsp;is a somewhat troubling trend.</p>
<p><strong>“Farmers&nbsp;should&nbsp;stop using so much&nbsp;glyphosate.”</strong></p>
<p>I tend to agree that farmers should stop using so much glyphosate. It is a reasonable request, at least from a big-picture perspective. Such heavy reliance on any single pesticide is probably not a good thing. But let’s zoom in to the farmer perspective. The image below is from a children’s book about how to make decisions. “<em>Knowing how to make decisions involves understanding the decision making process</em>.”&nbsp;There are reasons that farmers use&nbsp;so much glyphosate, and if we are serious about wanting them to change, we need to understand their decision making process. If farmers&nbsp;stopped using glyphosate, weeds wouldn’t just stop growing, so something else must be done to control them. There will be costs to that decision.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2843"><a href="https://plantoutofplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-1457210294139.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2843"><img loading="lazy" src="https://plantoutofplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/wp-1457210294139-248x300.jpg" alt="I page from a children's book, explaining the decision making process." width="248" height="300"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2843"><span>“<em>A big decision is easier to make when a person knows what to do. Knowing how to make a big decision involves understanding the decision making process.</em>“</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the&nbsp;costs of not using glyphosate<a href="http://assbt-jsbr.org/JSBR/Vol51/jsbrVol51Janp2to14ProfitabilityComparisonforGlyphosateResistantandConventionalSugarbeetProductionSystems2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> would be financial</a>. My own research has shown that glyphosate use in conjunction with a glyphosate resistant crop has significantly boosted net economic returns. Removing this option, then, would reduce the economic viability of many farming operations, at least under current farm policy.&nbsp;How would you respond if someone asked you&nbsp;to take a 5&nbsp;to 20% cut in pay? If we want farmers to make decisions that will negatively impact&nbsp;their own livelihood, then we need to&nbsp;figure out a financial incentive to make that happen. How much are&nbsp;<em>we</em> willing to pay to help farmers reduce their use of this herbicide?</p>
<p>There will be&nbsp;social costs to reducing glyphosate use, too. At least for&nbsp;some crops, farmers would have to&nbsp;miss more of their children’s baseball and softball games because without glyphosate, weed control can become much <a href="https://plantoutofplace.com/2013/01/social-aspects-of-biotech-crops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more complex, labor intensive, and time consuming</a>. The well-being of farmers is a <a href="http://www.nap.edu/read/12832/chapter/7#195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key indicator of agricultural sustainability</a>, and a major tenet of the agroecology movement. One reason many farmers have adopted this herbicide in the first place is because it has bettered their lives. Asking them to reverse those gains shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2852"><a href="https://plantoutofplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RRBeetWeeds.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2852"><img loading="lazy" src="https://plantoutofplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RRBeetWeeds-1024x512.png" alt="Data from Carlson et al. (2013)." width="600" height="300"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2852"><span><em>Glyphosate use in glyphosate-resistant crops has had a dramatic impact on farmers. This figure shows the number of farmers reporting weeds as their worst production issue in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota before and after adoption of glyphosate-resistant sugarbeet.</em></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And what about the environmental costs of reducing glyphosate use?&nbsp;One study estimates that using glyphosate herbicide in conjunction with glyphosate-resistant corn and soybean have <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21645698.2015.1025193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevented 41&nbsp;billion lbs of CO<sub>2</sub></a> from being released into the atmosphere between 1996 to 2013. Adoption of glyphosate-resistant soybean was recently&nbsp;estimated to have <a href="http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/02/17/ajae.aaw001.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased soil conservation tillage practices by 10, an notill adoption by 20%</a>.These practices help reduce soil erosion, and the many environmental problems associated with soil erosion. Is a reduction in glyphosate worth an increase in erosion and worsening climate change? I acknowledge this trade-off is far too simplistic, as there are ways to mitigate these impacts. But those options have costs also.</p>
<p>Because glyphosate breaks down quickly in the soil, farmers who spray glyphosate can&nbsp;rotate to any other crop the following year (or even in the same year). This makes farm management more flexible, and farmers can respond more easily to market&nbsp;changes. It also allows farmers to more easily diversify their crop rotation, which is one reason glyphosate is commonly used in diversified cropping systems.&nbsp;Conversely, many other herbicides (that would almost certainly increase if glyphosate use&nbsp;ceased) have substantial crop rotation restrictions. For example, spraying atrazine, nicosulfuron, or acetochlor (herbicides commonly used&nbsp;in conventional corn) will prevent planting many crops for 2 cropping seasons because they are so persistent. Soybean herbicide restrictions can be even greater; apraying imazethapyr precludes planting some crops for 40 months&nbsp;after application. If we truly want to encourage crop diversity, then glyphosate use can be a powerful tool in allowing those diverse crop rotations while still managing weeds.</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer that public interest in our food supply is a very good thing. And I also acknowledge that <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/080415-gulf-of-mexico-dead-zone-above-average.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modern agriculture has problems</a>. The public has a right to be engaged in the process of farming, <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2015/07/15/des-moines-water-works-lawsuit-buena-vista-calhoun-sac-counties-water-quality/30191169/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if farming decisions affect public resources</a>. But if we, as a community of food eaters, want large-scale changes in the way our food is grown, yelling and screaming and writing articles and editorials isn’t going to work. If we want to change the way farmers run their business, then we had better engage farmers to find out <em>why</em> they make the decisions they do. We need to understand the trade-offs involved&nbsp;if we are to understand&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to best implement the changes we want.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 01 Sep 2020</p>
<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.
</p>

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

<figure id="logo-program-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo-1.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo-1.png" alt="A grid made with 20 circles along with Logo source code for it"></a>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png" alt="A screenshot of Digger welcome screen with the names and pictures of various game characters with a copyright notice of Windmill Software"></a>
  <figcaption>
    Welcome screen of Digger
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

<figure id="digger-game-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-1.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-1.png" alt="A screenshot of underground maze in the game of Digger"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

-->

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

Our objective of evacuating 72 oil workers who were in Libya and desperately heading for the Algerian border was time critical.Â&nbsp; Gadaffi loyalists were in hot pursuit of them, either to kill them or more probably take them and use them as hostages, so how did it all come about?</p><p>It was late February and I was back at the Embassy in Algiers. I had just returned from Cairo where I was part of the UK consular team evacuating British residents. It was a pretty chaotic couple of weeks but we managed to get everybody out who reached Cairo.</p><p>It was the same in Tunisia a couple of weeks earlier. Again, we managed to get those UK citizens who wished to be evacuated out in a more timely and orderly fashion</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Algiers we were closely monitoring the situation that was developing in Libya. On 27 February, the UK mounted a military mission involving Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules and Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers that flew into the Libyan desert and managed to evacuate 150 oil workers.</p><p>However, it was well known that a large number of foreign oil workers were still stranded in the south and west of the country.</p><p>The Ambassador immediately contacted London who agreed that we should try to mount an evacuation operation. This one would be a consular led mission as opposed to a military one and we had to move fast.</p><p>The latest intelligence we had on the oil workers was that they were heading for the Libyan town of Ghadames which lies on the Libyan/Algerian border.</p><p>It was decided that I would lead the mission and would be accompanied by Mustapha, one of our Embassy drivers who would act as interpreter, the British Defence Attache (a Colonel) and an armed Royal Military Policeman (RMP), one of the Ambassadorâ€™s close protection team.</p><p>The reason for the military presence would be their ability, using their special communications equipment, to liaise with UK military back in London for intelligence updates. I then visited the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get their approval for the trip and to ask for accompanying security en-route.</p><p>For this mission, we had decided to drive.</p><p>It was a considerable distance, some 1300 Kms from Algiers to our proposed base of operations in the town of In-Amenas through the Atlas mountains and snaking through the northern Sahara desert. In addition, some of the provinces we would traverse were known to have active AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Maghreb) cells.</p><p>The Algerians agreed to provide security escorts for the whole of our trip and they did a wonderful job of looking after us the whole time.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/100_0228_2/#main"><img width="292" height="219" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1442" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1442"> Libya</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0038/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1451" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1451"> Route marker in the Sahara</figcaption></figure></div><p>Therefore it was with some trepidation we set off. The security situation and the areas we would have to travel through, even with our escorts was still a matter of concern. The time passed slowly as we drove through the Atlas mountains until finally we emerged from the mountains onto the desert plains.</p><p>By now it was late in the evening and dark as we reached the town of Ouargia where we spent the night.</p><p>The next morning at dawn, we set off for In-Amenas. Our aim was to head for the Sonatrach (the largest oil and gas company in Algeria who had agreed to help us) compound in the town, which would be our base for the duration of the operation.</p><p>Having arrived there and getting settled in, the Colonel contacted London who informed him that the oil workers had reached Ghadames, but the Libyan border guards would not let them cross the border until I had provided them with the official paperwork.</p><p>Further troubling news was that although Ghadames was in a Berber area,which had been actively anti-Gadaffi for years, pro-Gadaffi forces and militia were reported to be heading for the town in some force. So now time was definitely of the essence.</p><p>The next morning we left In-Amenas with our escort heading for the Algerian town of Deb-Deb which was just across the border from Ghadames. We arrived there in good time and while the Colonel established our presence with the local dignitaries.</p><div id="gallery-3"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0029/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1452" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0029.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1452"> With escort taking a position fix near Deb-Deb</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0032/#main"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-3-1453" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 450w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0032.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-3-1453"> Luxury overnight accommodation!</figcaption></figure></div><p>I headed for the border post to establish contact with the oil workers. They were a pretty tired looking bunch, not really surprising given what they had been through but I assured them that I was working now with the Libyan and Algerian border officials to get all 16 of them across the border.</p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0026-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0026-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1">Imagine my surprise when they told me that yes, there were 16 EU citizens but they had also brought with them an additional 56 foreign workers from their site, mostly Filipinos, Malays and several other nationalities. The spokesman for the group said they would not come across and leave their non-EU colleagues behind.</p><p>So instead of 16 evacuees we now had 72, a major consular headache. Quick decisions needed to be made. I left the border post and met up again with the Colonel and explained the predicament. We both decided that if we had to get 72 out so be it.</p><p>I contacted the Embassy in Algiers and told them of the situation and that I intended to bring all 72 across the border.</p><p>I also agreed with the Colonel that he and Noel would stay overnight in Db-Deb and keep tabs on the oil workers and brief them as to what was happening while I returned with my driver to In-Anemas to try and arrange coaches, accommodation and air transport.</p><p>For the next few, frantic hours was spent sorting out the logistical details in In-Anemas, arranging accommodation with Sonatrach, renting local coaches to convey everyone from Deb-Deb to In-Anemas and contacting London to get the German parent firm to arrange air transport for the party from In-Anemas back to Frankfurt.</p><p>I also spent most of the night redoing the official paperwork to show 72 evacuees instead of 16. To add to the urgency, I also received a call from the Colonel to say that we had to get the oil workers out within the next 24 hours as pro-Gadaffi forces were at that very moment nearing Ghadames. Time was critical.</p><p>So before dawn next morning we set off with my escort plus two coaches for Deb-Deb.</p><p>We arrived at lunchtime and I immediately got to work with the local Libyan and Algerian border officials to get clearance to bring the oil workers across the border.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, paperwork was signed off and permissions were granted from both sides and the guys finally crossed over into Algerian territory.</p><p>I was not prepared to hang about, so everyone was unceremoniously bundled onto the coaches and picking up the Colonel and the RMP we left Debdeb for In-Anemas.</p><p>After spending the night at the Sonatrach compound, the party headed for In-Anemas airport as I had been called from our Embassy in Algiers on reaching In-Amenas to say that the German parent company had chartered a flight for midday the next day.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/beating-gadaffi-forces-to-the-border-arab-spring-2011/img_0019/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1454" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1454"> Oil Workers at In-Amenas airport prior to their flight out to Frankfurt</figcaption></figure></div><p>After the formalities of customs, we all assembled in the departure lounge for a farewell photograph prior to the party boarding their flight to Frankfurt and then finally they were gone.</p><p>So it was with a sense of relief that we set off on the long 1300 Kms return journey back to Algiers. The trip back was uneventful and tiring.</p><p>We had been just in time. Pro-Gadaffi forces occupied Ghadames 12 hours after we got the guys out, so job well done. When I came to write up our post-operation report, I was pretty scathing of the German parent company.</p><p>They had known about the non-EU workers but had not told us. They were totally focussed in getting EU citizens out which was to my mind disgraceful.</p><p>The 16 EU oil workers in Ghadames whom we had originally planned to get out, despite giving me a major logistical problem, merited my fullest admiration for the loyalty they showed to their fellow non-EU workers in a dangerous situation, something their parent company singularly failed to do.</p><p>This evacuation of oil workers from Libya was my third evacuation during that period of the Arab Spring in 2011, the previous ones being the evacuation of British and EU nationals from Tunisia and then Egypt.</p><p>A true Band of Brothers.</p><p><em><strong>*Unless otherwise stated, all images are from my own personal collection*</strong></em></p><div heateor-sss-data-href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/"><p>Spread the love</p><ul><li><a data-pin-lang="en_US" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/" data-pin-count="false" data-pin-do="buttonPin" data-pin-config="beside"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=633" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=633"></a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Vim 8.1 was <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-8.1-released.php">released</a> in May 2018. The “main new feature” was official support for running a terminal within <code>vim</code>. Along with this came a built-in debugger plugin, <code>termdebug</code>, which provides a visual interface for interacting with <code>gdb</code>. This post walks through an example session using <code>termdebug</code>.</p>





<p> Let’s use <code>termdebug</code> to step through and inspect the following C program that calculates the factorial of a number. I’ll be using Ubuntu 18.04, along with a version of <code>vim</code> installed from the Ubuntu repo—8.0.1453—that includes the relevant feature that was <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-8.1-released.php">officially released</a> as part of <code>vim</code> 8.1.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>vim</code>, a working version of <code>gdb</code> is required for debugging. For Ubuntu, this can be installed from the Ubuntu repo. For macOS, <code>gdb</code> will have to be <em><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin">code signed</a></em>, and I’ve found that <code>gdb</code> versions earlier than 8.3 are problematic (tested on macOS Mojave). I haven’t tested debugging on Windows. Before trying to debug with <code>vim</code>, I suggest verifying that <code>gdb</code> works as expected on your system.</p>



<p>The path and/or name of <code>gdb</code> can be modified by setting the <code>termdebugger</code> variable before invoking the <code>termdebug</code> plugin.</p>



<h3><strong>Loading the <code>termdebug</code> Plugin</strong></h3>



<p>After loading the <code>factorial.c</code> source code, let’s load the plugin.</p>



<pre><code>:packadd termdebug
:Termdebug</code></pre>



<p>The tab will split into three windows, which I’ve rearranged so that the editor window is on the right, as shown below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin_loaded.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin_loaded.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>The top-left window is for interacting with <code>gdb</code>. The bottom-left window is for interacting with the program loaded by <code>gdb</code>. The editor window on the right—with the corresponding source code—will show breakpoints and highlight lines when stepping through a program. This window also has clickable buttons at the top for interacting with <code>gdb</code>.</p>



<h3><strong>Loading a Program</strong></h3>



<p>We’ll have to compile the code using the <code>-g</code> flag, which will include debugger information in the compiled program.</p>



<pre><code>:!gcc -g factorial.c -o factorial</code></pre>



<p>We can use the <code>gdb</code> window to load the program. In addition to <code>&lt;c-w&gt;</code> commands and/or mouse clicks, we can use the <code>:Gdb</code> command to jump to the <code>gdb</code> window. The following <code>gdb</code> command will load the program (highlighted in the image that follows).</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) file factorial</code></pre>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/file_loaded.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/file_loaded.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>Alternatively, we could have passed <code>factorial</code> as an argument when calling <code>:Termdebug</code> earlier.</p>



<h3><strong>Setting Breakpoints</strong></h3>



<p>Breakpoints can be set in the <code>gdb</code> window using ordinary <code>gdb</code> commands.</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) b factorial
(gdb) b 23</code></pre>



<p>Alternatively, breakpoints can be set by navigating to a line of code in the editor window and entering <code>:Break</code>.</p>



<p>Lines with breakpoints are indicated by <span><strong><code>&gt;&gt;</code></strong></span> in the editor window.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/breakpoints.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/breakpoints.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<p>Breakpoints can be removed with <code>gdb</code> commands <s>or by navigating to the relevant lines and entering </s><code><s>:Delete</s></code>. <strong>Update 2019/05/12 6:45pm ET</strong>: On my version of <code>vim</code>, <code>:Delete</code> is used to remove breakpoints, but this was changed to <code>:Clear</code> in a <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/71137fed4d77e985d49ca32c79f030512767b8ce">commit</a> on March 3, 2018.</p>



<h3><strong>Program Execution</strong></h3>



<p>The <code>:Run</code> command starts the program.</p>



<pre><code>:Run [args]</code></pre>



<p>Or alternatively, a program can be launched by entering the <code>run</code> command directly in the <code>gdb</code> window.</p>



<pre><code>(gdb) run [args]</code></pre>



<p>In either case, <code>[args]</code> should be replaced by the program’s arguments. Let’s use the value <code>6</code> to run the <code>factorial</code> program.</p>



<p>Both <code>:Run</code> and <code>(gdb) run</code> will pause execution at the first breakpoint. An alternative way to launch a program is to use <code>gdb</code>’s <code>start</code> command, which will pause execution at the beginning of the program.</p>



<p>I’ve launched the program using the <code>vim</code> command <code>:Run 6</code>. Execution is paused at the first breakpoint, with the corresponding line highlighted.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/run.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/run.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<h3><strong>Stepping through Code</strong></h3>



<p>There are various ways to step through a program.</p>



<ol><li>Invoking <code>gdb</code> stepping commands directly in the <code>gdb</code> window</li><li>Clicking <em>Step</em>, <em>Next</em>, <em>Finish</em>, <em>Cont</em>, <em>Stop</em>, <em>Eval</em> in the editor window</li><li>Issuing <code>vim</code> commands <code>:Step</code>, <code>:Over</code>, <code>:Finish</code>, <code>:Continue</code>, <code>:Stop</code></li></ol>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steps.gif"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steps.gif" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<h3><strong>Program Inspection</strong></h3>



<p>The values of variables can be inspected in various ways.</p>



<ol><li>Invoking <code>gdb</code> inspection commands directly in the <code>gdb</code> window</li><li>Hovering your mouse over variables in the editor window<ol><li>This requires the <code>+balloon_eval</code> compile-time feature</li><li>This worked for me in <code>gvim</code>, but didn’t work reliably when running <code>vim</code> in a terminal</li></ol></li><li>Issuing <code>vim</code> command <code>:Evaluate {expr}</code><br>Omitting <code>{expr}</code> will evaluate the expression under the cursor, which can also be performed by pressing <code>K</code></li></ol>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/eval.gif"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/eval.gif" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>After passing all breakpoints and running the program until termination, we can see <code>720</code> in the program window, which is the expected output for the calculation of <code>6!</code>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/finished.png"><img src="https://www.dannyadam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/finished.png" alt="" width="400"></a></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Three physicists received a $3 million Breakthrough prize for proving there isn’t a fifth power (that we all know of). And it began with a collection of table-top experiments utilizing low-cost tools.</p><p>Eric Adelberger, Jens Gundlach and Blayne Heckel collectively lead the “Eöt-Wash Group,” which is devoted to specific checks of bodily legal guidelines. They take their identify from the early-1900s physicist Loránd Eötvös and the College of Washington, the place they work. These Eöt-Wash researchers acquired their begin within the mid-Nineteen Eighties, utilizing a tool often called a “torsion steadiness” to disprove claims of an undiscovered fifth power in physics. Since then, they’ve used extra elaborate variations of the identical system to check the true energy of <u>gravity</u>, detect the tug of <u>darkish matter</u> within the Milky Approach and seek for theoretical bodily results like further dimensions and “axion wind.”</p><div data-render-type="fte" data-skip="dealsy" data-widget-type="seasonal">
<p>The group’s $3 million prize is certainly one of seven awarded this 12 months within the life sciences, physics and <u>arithmetic</u>. They received “for precision elementary measurements that take a look at our understanding of gravity, probe the character of darkish vitality and set up limits on couplings to darkish matter,” in keeping with Breakthrough.</p>
<p>Every year’s winners are chosen by previous recipients in a secret course of, and every profitable particular person or group receives greater than 3 times as a lot cash as winners of the <u>Nobel Prizes</u>. A gaggle of tech billionaires — Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, Yuri Milner, Julia Milner, Jack Ma and Pony Ma — provide the funds.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>The 18 largest unsolved mysteries in physics</strong></u></p>
<p>Adelberger, Gundlach and Heckel’s win is outstanding partially as a result of their group has not detected any previously-unseen phenomena, constructed any big experiments, or developed any outstanding new theories. As a substitute, they exactly measured bodily results that scientists already knew about, and so they examined claims made by different researchers with uncommon rigor. A few of their most vital outcomes have falsified scientific theories, moderately than proving them proper.</p>
<p>“That is really not what we’re out for, falsifying,” Gundlach instructed Stay Science. “We really are interested by new physics.”</p>
<p>Adelberger considerably disagreed.</p>
<p>“It is just a little extra difficult than that,” he instructed Stay Science. “Physics proper now’s in a sort of disaster. You have acquired two issues that work extraordinarily effectively: Einstein’s gravity and <u>quantum</u> theories. … Each of them have been examined very rigorously, each of them work splendidly. However they’re utterly inconsistent. So there’s one thing actually large we’re lacking. So it is vital to return and ask ‘How effectively can we perceive the issues that we predict we perceive?'”</p>
<p>That is led the crew to develop torsion balances that measure gravitational results to unheard-of ranges of precision.</p>
<p>A torsion steadiness is an easy system: Weights cling from a fiber such that Earth’s gravity pulls them straight down. If the one different forces appearing on the weights additionally pull straight down, they will not transfer in any respect. But when any forces pull them at even a slight angle, they will rotate, and the fiber will twist. It is potential to measure even very delicate twisting of a torsion steadiness’s fiber and detect terribly tiny results.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>6 bizarre details about gravity</strong></u></p>
<p>The trio constructed their first torsion steadiness within the mid-Nineteen Eighties after listening to a chat by one other physicist, Ephraim Fischbach of Purdue College. Fischbach claimed that the <u>4 elementary forces in physics</u> (<u>gravity</u>, <u>electromagnetism</u> and the <u>weak</u> and <u>robust</u> nuclear forces) had a fifth companion. This fifth power, he argued, was a bit like a faint, short-range gravity, pulling lots collectively at distances of as much as about 650 toes (200 meters).</p>
<p>Largely you would not discover this power, as a result of in house most objects are a lot farther aside than that. And on Earth, this supposed fifth power would nonetheless largely pull you in the identical route as gravity. At any given time, many of the mass close to you might be instantly beneath you.</p>
<p>Fischbach made his argument primarily based largely on knowledge from an early-Twentieth-century torsion steadiness experiment by Eötvös (whose identify would turn out to be a part of the Eöt-Wash Group’s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eötvös was testing Einstein’s equivalence precept, the concept two objects dropped on the similar time would fall towards a supply of gravity on the similar fee regardless of their mass, regardless of how briskly the room they’re in is shifting or the place it’s within the universe. Eötvös, like numerous later experimenters, discovered that Einstein’s equivalence precept was right Adelberger mentioned. However Fischbach, pouring by the info a long time later, thought he’d discovered a touch of one thing else, a signature of this fifth power.</p>
<p>“It was a fairly compelling argument,” Gundlach mentioned.</p>
<p>“And if it have been true, it might have been a giant deal,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>(Fischbach’s argument had issues, he mentioned, which the trio uncovered even earlier than they ran their very own experiment. Certainly one of them: Eötvös himself was a big man, and his personal gravity might have pulled his older torsion steadiness sideways, simulating a fifth power.)</p>
<p>Different researchers had seen Fischbach’s declare, and a few of them appeared to be detecting a fifth power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is as a result of their experiments weren’t designed effectively sufficient, Adelberger mentioned. “Fischbach stored telling us about all these different researchers who have been getting optimistic outcomes, and he mentioned ‘You are within the minority right here.’ And I mentioned, ‘You do not vote on physics.'”</p>
<p>Earlier experiments concerned a ball floating in water, which is problematic as a result of “a ball floating in water is topic to all types of forces,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>Folks flew all around the world searching for superb take a look at websites for a fifth power, cliffs subsequent to flat land the place the sideways pull of a short-range fifth power could be most exaggerated. The Eöt-Wash Group thought-about flying to Hawaii earlier than realizing it was extra sensible to simply use a hillside in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>Associated: </strong><u><strong>The 11 largest unanswered questions on darkish matter</strong></u></p>
<p>“There have been different individuals who have been utilizing torsion balances,” Gundlach mentioned. “However we made a bunch of little improvements that made the torsion steadiness so significantly better.”</p>
<p>One of many largest: Inserting the system on a turntable to cancel out exterior forces appearing on the torsion steadiness. The primary turntable they used was a lazy susan, the kind present in some kitchens and eating rooms.</p>
<p>“I bear in mind everybody was laughing at it,” Gundlach mentioned.</p>
<p>Different physicists thought the wobbling of the turntable would overwhelm the faint results they have been searching. However in the long run, with some refining, it labored.</p>
<p>“We simply did a whole lot of beautiful, intelligent issues and there was little question that this was convincing,” Adelberger mentioned.</p>
<p>There was no fifth power.</p>
<p>Over time, the crew’s torsion balances have turn out to be extra refined, requiring exact engineering. They rely closely on staff within the College of Washington’s machine store —— one of many few left within the nation hooked up to a physics division —— to consistently replace and take a look at their balances earlier than experiments. It is vital to get a torsion steadiness calibrated good, Heckel mentioned, as a result of as soon as an experiment begins it may run for days, months or years. And all that point is wasted if the machining and calibrating is not excellent. Any sudden wobbles or forces past the experiment that do not get cancelled out can spoil a batch of knowledge.</p>
<p>The trio’s methods have been utilized in all types of experiments that require very secure measurement gadgets. Know-how they developed to counteract seismic rumbling now helps maintain the laser beams of gravitational-wave detectors secure — contributing to the Nobel Prize-winning first detection of gravitational waves in 2016 and an entire new subject of astronomy.</p>
<p>Their newer, extra superior torsion balances hunt a lot fainter results than the disproved fifth power. Heckel designed a torsion steadiness that detects the delicate power of electrons whirling circles in a steel disk . It was designed to hunt the delicate stress of “axion wind,” a potential impact of darkish matter passing by Seattle. The steadiness by no means detected the wind, however did put new limits on how darkish matter particles couls look and behave.</p>
<p>The researchers have additionally constructed a torsion steadiness delicate to the gravitational pull of the Milky Approach. As a result of the mass of seen star methods within the Milky Approach is well-known, they have been capable of cancel it out of their experiment. That left simply the impact of the Milky Approach’s darkish matter on the torsion steadiness, which they may instantly measure. Their measurement confirmed no impact of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), a principle that rejects darkish matter and claims that extra difficult theories of gravity clarify its obvious results. (Not like the fifth-force experiment, this outcome did not persuade MOND theorists to surrender their claims, Edelberger mentioned. MOND researchers are a troublesome crowd to steer.)</p>
<p>And utilizing yet one more torsion steadiness they measured the power of gravity to unprecedented precision, canceling out different results to give you an awfully exact quantity for the gravitational fixed —— a quantity that governs equations utilizing gravity.</p>

<p>2020 is a lot. For over six months now, we’ve been changing and adapting to get through this pandemic. We’re wearing masks, keep distance to other people, and figure out the new normal as we go.<br>It’s not just our personal lives where we need to adapt, but also our business world. Suddenly, we can’t go to stores anymore, and in-person services become challenging or impossible. This situation forces many businesses to overthink their strategy.</p>



<p>Basically, from today on, they need to solicit or conduct business online and even reinvent themselves to stay relevant. We’re in the middle of Digital Transformation, and it just became non-optional. Either you accept and go with it or staying in the game will become more challenging than ever.</p>



<p>Because we can’t meet in person as we used to, much interaction happens online via websites, text, and video chat.<br>For companies, this means to step up their game in software development. There’s a lot of new tools and best practices to work through. How do you write clean code, integrate Code Reviews, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Delivery into your workflows?<br>But most importantly, do the internal processes support software development?</p>



<p>Let’s say a company’s strategy was to sell cars in their dealerships before and now wants to move the business online.<br>Building the software development competency in-house is one thing and a high priority. More importantly, however, it is to ensure that internal processes are set up to support a digital-first business model.<br>The process of how they sell a car now is changing completely. Before, there was a Salesperson that helped and walked you through everything. Now, there needs to be a configurator. You also need to keep track of how many cars you have in the lot and possibly deliver them to the customer’s home after the purchase.<br>How do you manage payments and signing paperwork? All of that needs to happen online and quickly.</p>



<p>To meet all these requirements, the software development team needs to focus on delivering software quickly and in high quality.<br>That includes Continuous Integration and Delivery, automated Testing, a well-defined deployment process, and short development cycles.</p>



<p>Since this will be a new system, not just from a technical standpoint but also from customer demand, it might not be easy to predict demand upfront.<br>This circumstance requires a dynamic hosting environment where you can quickly scale up and down as needed.</p>



<p>How quickly can you react to changing market conditions? How does your internal change process look?<br>If a customer requests a new feature or reports a bug, how long does it take you to react to it? Now, a bug fix is a different process than a feature request. Yet, both undergo some decision process beforehand before they get into software development.</p>



<p>If you look at your organization from a bird’s eye view, do you notice any bottlenecks? Ask yourself this: Where would your workflow break if you released unlimited work into the organization? Where’s the bottleneck? Is it software development? Is it QA? Ops? Product? This bottleneck will determine how much work you can get done in a unit of time.</p>



<p>So, it’s not just starting to hire software developers but also remodeling your entire organization to become digital.</p>

<p>The following is a series of commentary/lecture notes designed to provide a conceptual introduction to the study of fluid mechanics. I encourage readers to use them in conjunction with a traditional, more comprehensive text; my presentation is both highly unorthodox and prioritizes conceptual clarity and consistency over detail and numerical examples. A book made from these notes, which includes references &amp; additional reading, can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HfcFLzU1ZFvxrX1MW2ZqI5LYHOcq9nF7/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is a fast and modern VPN protocol.</p><p>It is a point-to-point VPN, which means it does not have a client-server architecture, but peers, and does not rely on a PKI, unlike OpenVPN. It is super simple to setup to connect multiple machines together.</p><p>WireGuard supports roaming, which means you can switch between network connections and not have to reconnect to your peers. On servers, it's rarely useful, but when one of the peer is a mobile client like a laptop or a smartphone, it's a life saver, because the usage of WireGuard is completely transparent.</p><p>I'm used to OpenVPN, I even maintain <a href="https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install">a quite popular script</a>, but WireGuard is better in pretty much all aspects.</p><p><strong>Edit: I made a <a href="https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install">wireguard-install script</a> to automate the installation!</strong></p><p>In this post, I will explain how I use WireGuard on my laptop and phone, which forward all their traffic to the server while having a dual-stack connectivity.</p><p>The setup is pretty simple : we have 2 peers, one server and one client. Connecting both in a private subnet is easy. The trick to make use of the VPN to forward all of the client's traffic trough the server is to:</p><ol><li>Make the client's WireGuard interface its gateway (default route)</li><li>Enable IP routing on the server</li><li>Enable NAT between the WireGuard interface and public interface on the server</li></ol><p>We will see how to add multiple clients at the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Ready?</p><h2 id="installing-wireguard">Installing WireGuard</h2><p>WireGuard comes in two parts: the tools, which will allow us to manage the peers and interfaces, and the Linux kernel module. On other platforms such as macOS, non-rooted Android and FreeBSD, the module is replaced by a userspace Go implementation.</p><p>FYI, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linus-Likes-WireGuard">it is planned for the WireGuard module to be integrated in the Linux kernel itself</a>.</p><p>WireGuard can run nearly anywhere, all the installation notes are <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">on the website</a>.</p><p>I'm usually using Debian 9 or Ubuntu 18.04 on my servers. On Debian, you need to install it from the <code>unstable</code> repository and on Ubuntu from a PPA.</p><p>I recommend the cheap $3.50 VM from <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6879746">Vultr</a>. You should choose the location that is the closest to you. They provide IPv4, IPv6 and 500 GB for traffic per month.</p><p>As for my clients, I use the macOS Go client, the Arch Linux build from the community repo and the Android app.</p><p>Edit: I use the excellent <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12">GUI client for macOS</a> now!</p><h2 id="configuring-wireguard">Configuring WireGuard</h2><p>Here are the steps:</p><ul><li>Add the WireGuard interface on the server</li><li>Add the WireGuard interface on the client</li><li>Add the server as a peer on the client</li><li>Add the client as a peer on the server</li><li>Tune the configuration to make the client's traffic go trough the server</li></ul><h3 id="configuring-the-wireguard-interface-on-the-server">Configuring the WireGuard interface on the server</h3><p>The configuration of WireGuard lives in <code>/etc/wireguard</code>.</p><p>We'll call our interface <code>wg0</code>, so the config file will be <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>.</p><p>First, let's assign IP addresses from a private subnet:</p><pre><code>[Interface]
Address = 10.66.66.1/24,fd42:42:42::1/64</code></pre><p>Then, let's define the port WireGuard will be listening on:</p><pre><code>ListenPort = 1194</code></pre><p>Then, let's generate a private key. WireGuard uses simple <em>Curve25519</em> public and private keys for cryptography between the peers.</p><pre><code><a href="https://stanislas.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="53213c3c27132434">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> ~# wg genkey

It will allow us to make our server and our client communicate.</p><p>On the client, add this :</p><pre><code>[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;server public key&gt;
Endpoint = &lt;server public ip&gt;:1194
AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.1/32,fd42:42:42::1/128</code></pre><p>Thanks to this, all the packets destined to <code>AllowedIPs</code> will be encrypted with <code>PublicKey</code> and sent to <code>Endpoint</code>.</p><p>On the server, it's basically the same, with the client private IP and without the endpoint:</p><pre><code>[Peer]
PublicKey = &lt;client public key&gt;
AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.2/32,fd42:42:42::2/128</code></pre><blockquote>Wait... No endpoint? But wasn't this supposed to be a point-to-point server?</blockquote><p>Yes! But WireGuard supports roaming on both ends, and that's what allows us to have peers on the server without endpoints. As long as the peers (the clients) have the initial endpoint of the server, the server will know where so send the packets back, because the client's endpoints will be built dynamically.</p><p>From the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#built-in-roaming">WireGuard website</a> about built-in roaming:</p><blockquote>The client configuration contains an <em>initial</em> endpoint of its single peer (the server), so that it knows where to send encrypted data before it has received encrypted data. The server configuration doesn't have any initial endpoints of its peers (the clients). This is because the server discovers the endpoint of its peers by examining from where correctly authenticated data originates. If the server itself changes its own endpoint, and sends data to the clients, the clients will discover the new server endpoint and update the configuration just the same. Both client and server send encrypted data to the most recent IP endpoint for which they authentically decrypted data. Thus, there is full IP roaming on both ends.</blockquote><p>I hope that makes sense. Keep in mind that WireGuard does not create a tunnel like OpenVPN does, but each packet is encapsulated right away.</p><p>Now, restart the WireGuard interface on the server and the client. The server does not know how to connect to the client, so the client should sent a packet first.	</p><p>When restarting the interface, here on the client, we can see that WireGuard added a route:</p><pre><code><a href="https://stanislas.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="3a494e5b545349565b497a57584a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> ~&gt; wg-quick up wg0

I’d like to talk a bit about goals, their importance, some concepts and techniques for individuals (Team/group goals are a different topic).</p>
<h2 id="performance-vs-developmental-goals">Performance vs. developmental goals</h2>
<p>There are basically two kinds of goals in a work setting - performance goals and developmental, a.k.a. growth goals. The key difference in theory is that performance goals focus on end results while developmental goals are learning &amp; growth oriented. In reality most companies use performance goals in a very narrow way, e.g. to incentivize the sales team. This created a bad rap for performance goals and a shift in terminology.</p>
<p>I am strongly biased <strong>in favor of developmental</strong> goals for software engineers. The reason is that I find that most engineers are highly motivated to grow and are also intrinsically motivated to perform in their roles and are just fine without “the boss” telling them how to perform. In fact, after working with cca. 200 engineers I’m yet to find a single one who doesn’t want to perform well in their job.</p>
<p>Helping your engineers with good growth goals and coaching / mentorship can add a lot of value for them, though. It helps them focus, since there’s always just too many things to learn next, it helps them feel they’re progressing, it helps with the alignment with the company’s expectations of their career - which is ideally what the market wants already - and last but not least it makes them feel they’re at the right company. I find that growth opportunities are just as important to engineers as an exciting product to work on, great colleagues, good company culture and of course, fair compensation. I had engineers leave solely because they felt they’re not growing anymore.</p>
<p>There are some rate situations in which performance goals do make sense. One I can think of is when there’s already a gap between your expectations and the engineer’s performance. Closing that gap might require very narrow, outcome-focused goals, but note that this should only be temporary (until closing the gap or deciding to part ways). An example for a place for performance goals is a PiP (Personal Improvement Plan).</p>
<p>I’d also like to have an argument against ‘by default’ performance goals. Setting performance goals <strong>will</strong> feel like micromanagement and mistrust for your engineers. General expectations should be set by the leveling system you hopefully have in place, your company and team culture and your shared values. If none of these inspire and define good performance, then you have a problem there. Setting individual or team performance goals is a band-aid solution.</p>
<p>Your HR department might try to push you towards setting performance goals for your engineers for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don’t deeply understand each department’s field</li>
<li>They want a uniform process and set of training materials across the company</li>
<li>They want an easy way to decide on promotions and compensation</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice is to be proactive about this, reach out to them and make sure you give context about why you believe performance goals don’t fit your department.</p>
<h2 id="okrs-kpis-and-smart-goals-oh-my">OKRs, KPIs and SMART goals, oh my</h2>
<p>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are two frameworks and concepts for goal setting</p>
<p>There are a plenty of articles about this topic, some very confusing. There’s also a false dichotomy floating around. No, it’s not an either-or situation.</p>
<h3 id="okrs">OKRs</h3>
<p>The best way to describe this framework is with this ‘formula’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You start out with high level Objectives which might be hard or impossible to measure by themselves then you come up with multiple Key Results. Key Results are like milestones but they don’t align on a linear timeline necessarily. They might or might not build/depend on each other.</p>
<p>Objectives are memorable qualitative descriptions of what you want to achieve. Objectives should be short, inspirational and engaging. An Objective should motivate and challenge the individual.</p>
<p>Key Results are a set of metrics/milestones that measure your progress towards the Objective. By definition the success of each key result needs to be easy do decide. It’s also OK not to achieve all of the key results! There’s usually not a 1-1 mapping between objectives and a set of key results.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example: you want to get better at programming in Go. An idea for an objective would be “I want to get confident at Go programming”. A set of potential Key Results could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a CLI tool for updating our JIRA board</li>
<li>Write a REST API service for X</li>
<li>Convert my old Go project to use go modules</li>
<li>Study and deeply understand the following pieces of the standard library: […]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a sense. I find this framework really helpful for breaking down vague high level “things I want” to actionable and measurable smaller pieces.</p>
<p>You might have seen company/department level OKRs which probably looked different, the reason for that is those usually have numbers as targets in their key results. Some of them are KPIs!</p>
<h3 id="kpis">KPIs</h3>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a goal setting method! This is just a way to structure measuring things, usually performance, usually on the company/departmental level. E.g. for engineering you could have some of these KPI candidates: number of deployments per day, MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery), Cycle time. On a company level some examples are burn rate, profit margin, NPS (Net Promoter Score).</p>
<p>The most important thing about KPIs is which differentiates them from any other metric/indicator is that they measure the most important aspects of performance. You can have many supporting metrics but KPIs should be few and represent the performance</p>
<p>In a developmental goal scenario KPIs sometimes come in handy, mostly for making sure we focus on the real important things and not some vanity metrics. KPI targets are nice Key Result candidates sometimes. Such an example would be an engineer who wants to improve in code quality identifying e.g. mean pull request back-and-forth cycles as a KPI and then setting a target for it as a Key Result.</p>
<h3 id="smart-goals">SMART goals</h3>
<p>This is another framework that can be combined with others. This talks about how an ideal goal should look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific (simple, sensible, significant).</li>
<li>Measurable (meaningful, motivating).</li>
<li>Achievable (agreed, attainable).</li>
<li>Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).</li>
<li>Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).</li>
</ul>
<p>The OKR framework guarantees some of these but this is still good guidance.</p>
<p>Consider the previous example: “I want to get confident at Go programming”. Is this a SMART goal? Well… it’s not specific, it’s vaguely measurable (very subjective), probably Achievable, probably Relevant and not time bound.</p>
<p>You could wrangle a bit with making it a SMART goal but I found that some things (the personal and motivating aspect especially) can get lost in that effort. I grew to prefer OKRs over religiously SMART goals.</p>
<p>Again, this is another aspect to take into account and good guidance in general.</p>
<h2 id="not-clinging-to-goals">Not clinging to goals</h2>
<p>Now we got to the most important discussion about goals.</p>
<p>Your engineers set the most amazing developmental goals, so full of energy, motivation, ready to take on the world - then life happened. Should they feel bad? Should you be disappointed as their manager?</p>
<p>Hell no. Of course it’s not nice when someone constantly ditches their goals but goals reflect an intent AND a life situation. Both can change. People might find out that Go is not their thing after all and jump to Rust instead. Did they fail their goal? Of course not. Hell, COVID might happen and people end up cramped together with flatmates or family, not really feeling energetic enough to keep learning. They might not be doing super well in work/life balance.</p>
<p>I might do a separate posts about the buddhist concept of non-attachment and stoicism to give some more perspective here. The bottom line is that goals in general work best if you don’t cling to them but use them as north stars and proxies.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-support-your-engineers-in-setting-and-achieving-goals">How can you support your engineers in setting and achieving goals?</h2>
<p>First and foremost by being supportive, not demanding (see the previous section).</p>
<p>Depending on the level and experience of the individuals you might need to be more suggestive, using your own past experience to come up with good goal ideas.</p>
<p>Make sure they understand it’s for them and you’re not there to dictate goals, merely to support them.</p>
<p>Understand that you’re not always the best person to help them in reaching their goals! There’s a difference between coaching and mentoring and maybe already coaching is better done by someone else in specific areas. Remember, you’re there to support, not to dictate! If you feel someone else is better suited to help in a specific area, connect them!</p>
<p>Make sure they have enough <strong>actual</strong> support for achieving their goals, such as time and mentorship <em>during working hours</em>! I actually have a post about it:&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/learning-at-work-is-work/">Learning at work is work</a></p>
<p>I hope this article was useful for some of you out there, most things are trivial here, no great revelations but I sure could have used it a few years back :)</p>

<li>*fixes in Getting Rid of Exceptions snippet 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was introduced to Rust in 2018 and has been enamored since. Rust is a system programming language, much like C++. Unlike C++ though, being relatively new, its language design is more modern and sophisticated. Writing with can feel more like writing TypeScript or Haskell. Not surprising since, despite being a language with a very minimum runtime and no GC, it derives many principles of functional programming such as immutability, type inference, higher-order functions, pattern-matching, etc. Over the course of tinkering things with Rust, I realized that writing Rust code makes me a better coder in other languages. This article will describe how my attempt to push the best in Rust's language design into TypeScript, my main language, without altering the language itself.</p>
<h2>Getting Rid of Exceptions</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes me the first time I learnt Rust is that there are no straightforward to write exception-like code in Rust. For someone used to exceptions after using many languages like C++, Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, this seems like an incomplete language. But Rust's lack of straightforward exception-like is actually thought out in advance.</p>
<p>Exceptions feel neat the first time you understand it. A thrown exception skips code execution into the <code>catch</code> block. By doing that you can ignore the rest of code in the function. The rest of the code in the function represents positive case, which may seem irrelevant when an error happens. Here's a piece of code:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Error: foo"</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>}
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>When <code>baz</code> is called it will throw an uncaught exception. By reading the code you know that <code>foo</code> throws an Error. Debugging this snippet is a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Now let's see another snippet. In the snippet below you are importing a function that can throw exception.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>callMe</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"somePackage"</span><span>;

</span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>callMe</span><span>();
}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>);
}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Compared to the first snippet, this one is harder to debug. It seems so because 1.) You don't know that <code>callMe</code> will throw an error or not. 2.) If it throws an exception you will not know what is the type of the exception. The more modular your code is, the harder it is to debug exceptions.</p>
<p>Why is that? If you noticed, in the first snippet, you know which function is throwing what because the <code>throw</code> and the caller are in one file. You don't need to switch files or even scroll that far to see what's wrong. Furthermore, unlike in other language like java, TypeScript exceptions are not typed. Because of that, unlike return values, the compiler could not deduce if a function will throw an exception or not, and that's bad. Combined with the fact that an exception propagates up until they are caught. That means exception can be n-level deep. The deeper it is from, the harder it is to debug it.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with statically-typed language, deferring what's supposed to be done in compile-time to run-time is bad. It hands over problems from the compiler to the user.</p>
<p>There are best practices for writing <code>try/throw/catch</code>, such as developers should throw <code>Error</code> objects instead of nullish values. But pushing everyone to apply best practice is not enough. You cannot assert control toward what is being written in external dependencies. There are not many points introducing law when enforcers are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Only when you have dealt with complex codebase you will understand why <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">we should not use exception for flow control</a>.</p>
<p>So how Rust does this? Rust encourages us to return errors instead of throwing it by providing a data type called <code>Result</code>. It is a tagged union which can either be <code>Ok(IdealData)</code> or <code>Err(NonIdealData)</code>. With this, a function can communicate the situation of a a call to its caller. For example:</p>

    <div data-language="rust">
      <pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span> () {</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"1"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>non_number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>number</span><span>);      </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>non_number</span><span>);  </span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>The function <code>.parse()</code> converts a <code>string</code> into <code>u8</code>. There are scenarios where parsing a <code>string</code> into a <code>u8</code> can result in failure, one is if the parsed string is not a numeric string. Because <code>.parse()</code> has a negative case, it returns <code>Result&lt;u8, _&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In Rust, <code>Err</code> does not jump like exceptions. Regardless the result is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>, the program will simply execute the next line. To handle the error the programmer has to check the return value is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. Early return is encouraged instead of throw. Rust has the <code>?</code> syntax which help making early returns more concise to write and read.</p>
<p>To adopt this feature to TypeScript, these are the important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors are returned instead of thrown</li>
<li>Errors types are known</li>
</ol>
<p>To simulate this behavior I am going to use tagged union too. I found this helpful library, <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">fp-ts</a>. It covers a great deal of functional programming experience by leveraging TypeScript's type system, but I will only use a small portion of it.</p>
<p><code>fp-ts</code> has <code>Either&lt;Left, Right&gt;</code> data type. It is like Rust's <code>Result</code> but more flexible. <code>Either</code> is a tagged union value container. <code>Either</code> is <code>Left</code> or <code>Right</code>, usually <code>Right</code> represents the ideal case and <code>Left</code> represents the non-ideal case but both can be used with any types. Below is the type definition of <code>Either</code>.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"left"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span> </span><span>};
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"right"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>What's cool about <code>Either</code> is that TypeScript actually supports deducing tagged union from its tag. For example inside this block <code>if (someEither._tag === "left") { }</code> TypeScript knows that <code>someEither</code> is a <code>Left</code>. If there's a <code>return</code> in that block, TypeScript will deduce that for the rest of the function block, <code>someEither</code> data type is <code>Right</code> and not <code>Either</code> anymore.</p>
<p>Let's make a called <code>tryCatch</code>. It is used to wrap a function into Either. <code>fp-ts</code> actually provides this function, but let's write it so that we know what's under the hood.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>tryCatch</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>onError</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unknown</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>());
</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>onError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));
</span><span>  </span><span>}
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>With our newly created <code>tryCatch</code>, creating a URL from string for example can be done like this.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tryCatch</span><span>(
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>),
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span>()
</span><span>  </span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Calling the function will look like this. The following snippet receives a string called <code>maybeUrl</code>. If <code>maybeUrl</code> is not a valid URL it returns an error. If the URL is not calling "example.com" it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns a promise from the <code>fetch</code> call.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>callThisMaybeUrlIfItIncludesExampleDotCom</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(
</span><span>  </span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
):</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>&lt;</span><span>any</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span>(</span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isLeft</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>left</span><span>;

</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>right</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>());

</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>));
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>There's a bit more line of codes here, but it is great that the TypeScript compiler now can deduce the error type and you have more control over the flow. You can even deduce if the variable <code>error</code> is <code>instanceof</code> <code>NotExampleDotComError</code> or <code>InvalidURLError</code> for cases like printing different errors.</p>
<h2>Safe TypeScript</h2>
<p>If you have played an early 2000s FPS games and tried to cheat, usually you will find the <code>noclip</code> command. It makes your avatar fly through walls and grounds. Sometimes, though, you take a shortcut and triggers the wrong script. When that happens, you can't finish your level and must restart to make it work again.</p>
<p>That's how I see Rust's <code>unsafe</code> and TypeScript's <code>any</code>.</p>
<p>These two features solve a similar problem. In Rust's case, it enables developers to temporarily unlock the power of handling raw pointer in case someone needs it. In TypeScript's case, someone might need to escape into the free-typed JavaScript world. And in both, it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure everything is fine before the program goes back to the safe system.</p>
<p>Unsafe to safe Rust is like <code>any</code> type to typed TypeScript. Unlike Rust, TypeScript's type only works until you compile it to JavaScript code. Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/conversion/try_from_try_into.html">TryInto/TryFrom</a> trait to convert raw data into a data type. But in TypeScript's case, if you inject a value that does not match TypeScript's type annotation, TypeScript can't do anything. This comes from TypeScript team's decision to make it only a thin layer on top of JavaScript. They thought it is best if for people to write TypeScript like JavaScript and the compilation result to look almost the same as the source code.</p>
<p>My approach for this would be securing all external hole of my application, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPIs, which consist of DOM, deserializable user inputs, fetch API, etc.</li>
<li>External Dependencies which returns <code>any</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was trying this approach, I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, created by the same author as <code>fp-ts</code>. This library helps me create a runtime type checker, or "codec" as the library's author calls it. Instead of writing:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>

<h2>From Vim to Ed</h2>
<p>I switched from Vim to Ed twelve months ago,
and I wanted to report my findings on this
strange downstream adventure I took.</p>

<p>I’d been using Vim since about 1998, and I
hardly got close to mastering it after all those
years. In fact, that was one of the reasons I
thought of trying something like Ed: I was tired
of turning a corner only to find a zillion other
great features Vim offers.</p>

<p>I wanted to use an editor that didn’t have
features that were constantly distracting me
from what’s important: writing code.</p>

<h3>The goods</h3>


<p>Ed had one of the most fantastically steep learning
curves in all my many years of nerding. This ol’
editor was so weird in so many ways, I almost
lost heart right off the bat.</p>

<p>A good deal of the Ed ideas are forgotten
in time.  Nobody uses a line-based editor,
so this was one strange playing field to get
accustomed to.</p>

<p>However, once the learning curve was overcome,
the terseness of what I could do became an asset.</p>

<p>In Vim, there’s a million different ways to
get your cursor to zip all around. One of my
favorites was <code>w</code> where on the line in question,
all in normal mode, I could dart over to my
change in word-step motion.</p>

<p>In Ed, the line in question is right there in
front of you, and all you have is ‘regex’ as
your weapon to swap one thing for another.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised how good one can get via
this sole usage pattern. It’s not all that bad,
and thankfully, some distributions of Ed have
nice little shortcuts to make this all the
less pedantic.</p>

<p>With only a few agilities, Ed limits your usage
to x, y, or z. The result?  You get so darn good
at those.</p>

<p>Another powerful plus for Ed, is its undo/redo
limitation.</p>

<p>Usually, one would think, that after some
hacking, one would want to undo changes that
happened twenty edits ago. In Vim, you’d just
hold down <code>u</code> until it gets to that state. In Ed,
the buffer is limited to one undo. Incredibly,
this limitation has never ruined my day. Because
of my for-knowledge that Ed can’t undo twenty
edits ago, my approach on edits has been
‘Edified,’ and my behavior is in sync with this
one undo world.</p>

<p>I don’t pop open Vim ever, except to run a spell
check on something that isn’t code (like this
blog post, for example). Fascinating to me:
one of the side effects of Ed is my spelling
got a lot better. I’m more careful about what
I type, as the pain to undo or edit things is
quite real. Go figure!</p>

<h3>The bads</h3>


<p>Vim offers so much, it’s hard to
compare Ed to something this feature-rich. So,
I won’t.</p>

<p>Rather, I’ll just jot down some of my Ed-related
gripes.</p>

<p>First, one can scroll forward a page via <code>z</code>
in Ed, but one cannot do the reciprocal. I
was so bummed out on day one regarding this,
and I’m still bummed out 365 days later. What I
find shocking, is that <abbr>UNIX</abbr> <code>mail</code> has <code>z</code> to go
forward a page in header listings, and also <code>-z</code>
to go back a page. If only this was baked into
Ed from the start. My workaround is terrible,
and funny as it may sound, when I’m fatigued,
I sometimes try <code>-z</code> to see if it magically
started working.</p>

<p>Perhaps more of a gripe to the authors of <code>sed</code>
rather than Ed, but I wish there was a 100%
compatibility with ‘regex’ substitution patterns
that are valid in Ed, but in <code>sed</code>. This is
not the case, and it’s a shame. In general,
one has to forget about Ed’s awesome shorthand
tricks to get <code>sed</code> to work. It would be great
if the bounty of Ed vocabulary I’ve built up
just simply worked one-for-one in <code>sed</code>.</p>

<h3>More Ed for me</h3>


<p>One year dedicated to Ed is probably enough time
to arrive at a plateau of know-how where the
limitations will remain as such, and the pains
can’t be overcome with any more learning. That
said, I think I’ve arrived at a comfortable spot
with Ed, and I’m going to stick it out with it!</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

<h2 id="if-they-don-t-give-you-a-seat-at-the-table">If they don’t give you a seat at the table…</h2>

<p>Last July I decided to take a plunge and try to start a technology company. It felt like a idea good time: I felt that I had come to a standstill in my current software engineering role and needed a new challenge. While ‘needing a new challenge’ on its own is not a good enough reason to take the financial and career risk that is trying to create a company, I wanted to see if maybe trying to forge my own opportunities would be better than trying to knock down doors that were closed to me. I suppose in a way, this was me trying to bring my folding chair to the table.</p>

<p>It would have definitely been smarter to stay in the industry for a bit longer, for research shows that inspite of our image that a successful startup founder is a 20-something hacker in his college dorm/parents garage, most of the successful company founders are in their 30s and 40s. Presumably more experience in an industry helps in forming the B2B sales channels that a new company will need to generate cashflow. However, I felt that now, before I had financial commitments or dependents, would be a good idea to try out some of my own ideas and see where they go.</p>

<p>The tech industry is mired in mythology of entrepreneurship. Our industry publications are filled with more and more extravagant stories of venture capital funding, exits, IPOs, betting on which companies will break the unicorn ceiling next. “Startup” is its own culture and startup CEOs have their own fanclubs. If you move in these crowds, you’ll soon learn to speak in the language of series A-D, valuations and the obsession to ‘disrupt everything’. From the beginning, I knew that this would not be the path for me. I have neither the university names nor stints at the Big Four to bolster my chances of ending up in the portfolios of Sand Hill Road VC companies. So it would be bootstrapping from the get-go! For a bit over a year, I’ve developed products based on a few business ideas I’ve had, tested the market and tried to monetize them. Below are some of the lessons that I’ve learnt in one year of being an small tech business.</p>

<h2 id="wear-all-the-technology-hats-all-the-time">Wear all the technology hats all the time</h2>

<p>Most software teams in companies that I have worked for are organized to allow every person on a team to specialise in a particular area or technology. For example, one person in the team specialises in front end technologies, another in UX design, and another in the backend component and perhaps another in QA, testing and perhaps one in security. As a solo developer, you have to wear all those hats at once: design the backend, deploy it onto a cloud provider, do a security analysis and harden the app, write automated tests, code the user interface and think about things such as accessibility, design and user experience.</p>

<p>There are certainly those folks in our industry who are comfortable generalists, able to smoothly sail from optimising an SQL query to implementing a responsive website to writing YAML files for a Kubernetes deployment, but I am most definitely not one of them. My expertise lies in building backend/server-side components for processing data and deploying them onto a cloud provider’s infrastructure (usually in a containerised form to a platform such as AWS’ ECS or Google’s Kubernetes Engine), so doing a deep dive into the world of designing user interfaces that are easy to use was a challenge!</p>

<p>I had to dust off my rusty CSS and Javascript skills and read up a lot on designing user experiences. What made this aspect even more challenging, was that a huge chunk of traffic these days comes from mobile devices and designing a user interaction experiences for smaller screens can be very challenging - in particular, if you want to re-use parts of your existing frontend codebase.</p>

<p>The fun doesn’t stop once you’ve got your MVP. Now, you have to put on your DevOps hat on: think about CI/CD, deployment, monitoring and alerting!</p>

<h2 id="build-it-and-they-won-t-come">Build It and They Won’t Come</h2>

<p>The hardest part is just starting out they said. Build it and they will come they said. Well, build it and they might come is closer to the truth. There are lots of cool technology projects out there that are great fun to code, but don’t have any market demand. So it’s important to test out your idea early and do it often. Find the places where your target audiences hang out online and test out the waters. If you are targeting the B2B market, identify who your customers are going to be: big companies, small and medium sized companies, or startups. Will your customers be other tech companies or companies from other industries? How do the people responsible for technology purchases in those companies discover new products? Is it from conference talks or blogposts? Industry publications? Meetups? Magazines?</p>

<p>Building up traffic for your app can be a slow process and this is especially important for businesses that are planning to use the affiliate model to generate revenue: have a runway and be prepared to try out different strategies to get traffic.</p>

<h2 id="you-might-have-to-pivot-more-than-once">You Might Have to Pivot More than Once</h2>

<p>Be prepared to be disappointed. Even some really cool ideas don’t pan out in the end. Some ideas are just too far out there for a company or a consumer to pay you for it. I started Synbyote with an idea of making an on-demand synthetic data company. The goal was to see if there was a market for synthetic datasets that companies could use to benchmark and test their machine learning software. I knew that something similar was out there in the market already - a website called <a href="https://mockaroo.com/">Mockaroo</a>, with a paid plan and a per row of data pricing model, which I thought very interesting. I decided to try a similar pricing model for synthetic data.</p>

<p>My first mistake was to deep dive into coding without doing any customer interviews or market research. After a month or so of researching technologies and developing an app that allowed users to generate a timeseries dataset with custom anomalies, I started looking for machine learning companies that would be willing to try out synthetic datasets to benchmark their anomaly detection algorithms. I had lots of nice customer interviews with companies in the Ops and Security space, but ultimately this concept was too novel and there was no demand for it.</p>

<p>I then dived deep into the world of cloud based data science environments. I started working with JupyterHub, a component that creates and authenticates single user Jupyter notebook servers. This makes it easy to host server side environments for large groups of people: for research and data science teams and for classrooms. This journey led me to learn more about cloud computing platforms from the three big providers: Google Cloud, Azure and AWS. I deployed JupyterHub on Kubernetes instances on all three and presented my findings at PyData London and PyData Amsterdam.</p>

<p>This time I was wiser. I started doing customer interviews often and early. I talked to teams and companies and Jupyter users at conferences. There was a lot of interest, especially from the academic side. Unfortunately, none of this resulted in immediate cashflows and it proved too expensive to run the demo Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>A few months after my JupyterHub project, I started working on visual colour search engines. I read up on computer vision techniques for identifying sections of images and machine learning algorithms for colour segmentation and started building a colour similarity index of makeup products I might want to try at some point in the future. The culmination of this work (described on my company website synbyote.io) is the colour search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> which helps users discover new lip colour products.</p>

<h2 id="there-will-be-admin-lots-of-it">There will be admin. Lots of it.</h2>

<p>Companies need to file taxes and payroll and register for a whole bunch of things. This will be your responsibility. You will need to maintain the website and pay the web hosting bills, maintain accounts and make sure they are correct and accurate. This will consume a nontrivial amount of time.</p>

<p>Bootstrapping usually means doing contracts to fund further development of your startup. Finding new contracts, contacting recruiting agencies, navigating the resulting paperwork and interviewing for roles will take up a nontrivial amount of time. There will be stressful times when you will get rejected from a contract you thought was surely yours. Things that seem doable with a fulltime permanent job (such as getting a rental apartment in a high-demand city like London) will be harder since you won’t pass the automate ‘fully employed’ checkbox many agencies and landlords require.</p>

<h2 id="learn-marketing-and-sales">Learn marketing and sales</h2>

<p>No matter how much we want the world to love our nascent startup idea, it won’t happen without effort. This is where marketing and sales come in. Yes, if you want to make money off your technology, you will have to do marketing: write that blogpost, attend that conference, speak to your users, find out what they think about your product. If you are working with companies, you will have to do sales: negotiate deals, help your customers integrate your product and so forth. Code, usually, does not sell itself.</p>

<h2 id="would-i-do-it-all-again">Would I do it all again?</h2>

<p>I probably would! I got to explore lots of new avenues, a feel for what it is like to be responsible for a real product with real users, a feel for prioritising ideas (as a solo developer you are extremely limited in time, so you have to strike the right balance between addressing tech debt, doing marketing and sales and implementing new features) and got to feel a sense of accomplishment for creating a product that is very useful for a niche audience!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Traffic filtering is a common technique used to protect networks and hosts from malicious activity. The filtering can be done in the incoming and outgoing flows, better known as ingress and egress filtering. There are many examples of use cases for ingress filtering: mitigating DDoS attacks, avoiding SPAM, blocking access to services for specific geographic regions and so on.</p>
<p>One common application of egress filtering is to prevent applications and users from reaching remote hosts.
These kinds of filters are usually based on a large deny-list of IP address ranges, like <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/blog/reputation-block-lists-protecting-users-everywhere">Reputation Block Lists</a>. The technology used to perform this task has to be able to handle a high number of restricted hosts, up to millions in some cases.</p>
<p>Our friends at SAP asked us to perform a benchmark of the common Linux technologies available for this task. This blog post presents the methodology and results from benchmarking some of the Linux filtering technologies: eBPF, IP sets and iptables.</p>
<p><em>Update 2020-09-14:</em> we have received some great feedback and suggestions about other options to try, including BPF JIT optimization (that we left inadvertently disabled) and inline BPF map lookup. We will take a look at this and update this post as soon as possible - expected at the end of the month.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>We had the following goals going into this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reproducible benchmark framework that anyone else can download and use.</li>
<li>Evaluate the different mechanisms in the Linux networking stack to filter out a large amount of IP addresses and assess their scalability when the amount of IP ranges to block reaches 1 million.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>We aim to understand the cost of performing egress filtering based on the destination IP in a large set of IP ranges.</p>
<p>The scenario we consider is composed of a client and a server computer that communicate through an IP network. The egress filtering is performed on the client machine and there is no filtering performed on the server side.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/scenario.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>An egress filter has to perform a matching operation to understand if a packet can continue its way or has to be dropped. This operation could be costly if the number of blocked IPs is high. This kind of filter impacts the throughput of IP connections, it consumes extra CPU and increases the latency. We decided to take into consideration these metrics under the following conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Latency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-filtering-mechanisms">Linux Filtering Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel provides different mechanisms to filter network packets. In this benchmark we considered the most known ones. iptables is the historical and probably more known filtering utility in Linux. IP sets support high speed matching for sets of specific types, like IP ranges for instance. eBPF is very flexible and customizable. The following section provides more details of how we used those mechanisms in our benchmark.</p>
<h3 id="ebpf">eBPF</h3>
<p>eBPF is a virtual machine built in the Linux kernel. In the networking scope, it allows the user to load programs that are executed each time a packet arrives or is sent out of a networking interface. Those eBPF programs can modify, redirect or drop the packets.</p>
<p>There are different types of networking eBPF programs, CGROUP_SKB for per-cgroup filtering, SCHED_CLS and SCHED_ACT for filtering at the traffic control level, and XDP for filtering at the network interface level.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/ebpf.svg">
</figure>
<p>In our scenario, we want to apply the same filtering regardless of the cgroup of the application generating the traffic. The traffic coming from non-local applications or forwarded traffic should be filtered as well. This makes filtering at the socket level unfit for our scenario. XDP programs can only be attached to the ingress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> path, removing it from consideration in our tests also. By process of elimination, we only consider eBPF programs attached to the traffic control layer.</p>
<p>Given that we want to keep the tests as simple as possible we decided to implement <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/blob/master/pkg/filters/bpf/datapath/bpf.c">our own</a>filtering program in eBPF that will be attached to the traffic control layer with a clsact qdisc. The clsact qdisc was introduced in Linux 4.5, it’s a pseudo qdisc that allows to attach eBPF programs in ingress and egress using the <a href="https://qmonnet.github.io/whirl-offload/2020/04/11/tc-bpf-direct-action/">direct-action</a> mode.</p>
<p>Our filter implementation uses an <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b95a5c4db09bc7c253636cb84dc9b12c577fd5a0">LPM map</a> to save the list of IP addresses to block. eBPF implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match">LPM</a> algorithm with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">digital tree</a>.</p>

<h3 id="iptables">iptables</h3>
<p>We tested the standard iptables implementation by adding DROP rules to the OUTPUT chain in the filter table. The rules we used have the following format</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -o eth0 -m comment --comment "benchmark" -j DROP</code></p>
<p>While implementing this filter we found that appending each rule independently was too slow and we had to use the <code>iptables-restore</code> utility to do it.</p>
<p>iptables uses a linear search algorithm for rule matching.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="ip-sets">IP Sets</h3>
<p>We performed the testing also with the <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/">IP sets</a> framework. We used an IP set of type <a href="https://ipset.netfilter.org/ipset.man.html#lbAZ"><code>hash:net</code></a> and linked it to iptables by using the following rule:</p>
<p><code>-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -m set --match-set myset dst -m comment --comment benchmark -j DROP</code>.</p>
<p>The IP address to check is hashed and the result of the hash is used as the index in a hash table. Each bucket of the hash table contains an array of networks for that hash. When an IP address is checked against an IP set of type “hash:net”, it is not known what network size will match. The IP set implementation hashes the IP address for all possible network sizes. For instance, if the IP to match is 1.2.3.4, it looks for 1.2.3.4/32, for 1.2.3.4/31 and so on until all the 32 possible network sizes have been tested.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="benchmark-set-up">Benchmark Set-up</h2>
<p>We used <code>iperf3</code> to measure the performance of TCP, UDP and the CPU usage. The standard <code>ping</code> utility was used to measure the latency. We tested with 10, 100, 1k, 10k, 100k and 1M rules and each test was run 5 times to get statistical robustness.</p>
<p>We used two bare metal servers - running on <a href="https://www.packet.com/">Packet</a> - as client and server machines. The specifications of such servers are:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">c2.medium.x86
1x AMD EPYC 7401P 24-Core Processor @ 2.0GHz
2x 120GB SSD
2x 480GB SSD
64GB RAM
2x 10Gbps
</code></pre></div><p>The exact versions of the tools we used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> by Kinvolk alpha (<a href="https://www.flatcar-linux.org/releases/#release-2605.0.0">2605.0.0</a>)</li>
<li>Linux kernel 5.4.59</li>
<li>iperf 3.0.7 (in a Docker container with the host network)</li>
<li>iptables v1.6.2</li>
<li>ipset v6.20.1, protocol version: 6</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/k8s-egress-filtering-benchmark">https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark</a> has all the tools and instructions to reproduce these tests.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="test-1---tcp-throughput">Test #1 - TCP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-tcp-linerate.svg">
</figure>
<p>The throughput graph shows that the test is reaching line rate, 10Gbps because we are using a single connection hence only one of the interfaces on the bonding is used in most of the cases. Only iptables with more than 10k rules is not able to handle that performance. From this test we can conclude that iptables doesn’t scale well after 100k, but unfortunately we cannot conclude anything from other tests as network performance is the bottleneck.</p>
<p>In order to stress the CPU more, we performed another test using UDP.</p>
<h3 id="test-2---udp-throughput">Test #2 - UDP Throughput</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/throughput-udp.svg">
</figure>
<p>The goal of this test is to saturate the CPU. We used UDP packets and the <code> -b 10G</code> parameter to try to reach line rate. The graph shows that none of the cases reaches the 10Gbps line rate, it’s good for this test because it means the network is not the bottleneck anymore.</p>
<p>We can see that iptables does not scale well beyond 1k rules and that IP sets are a bit faster than eBPF on the clsact qdisc with a high number of rules.</p>
<h3 id="test-3---cpu-usage">Test #3 - CPU usage</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/cpu.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used <code>iperf</code> with a target bandwidth of 1Gbps (<code>-b 1G</code>) to avoid saturating the CPU and be able to compare the CPU usage with the different filters. We take the CPU usage reported by <code>iperf</code> that includes all the applications running on the host. From the above graph we can see that the CPU usage with iptables increases when using more than 1k rules. The CPU usage with eBPF and IP sets filters stays almost constant showing a bit higher usage in the eBPF case.</p>
<h3 id="test-4---latency">Test #4 - Latency</h3>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/latency.svg">
</figure>
<p>We used the standard Linux ping utility to measure the latency with the <code>-i 0.001</code> and <code>-c 1000</code> parameters, sending 1000 pings at a 1 millisecond interval. The above graph shows that the latency is not affected by the number of rules in the eBPF and IP sets filters, it’s ~27µs in those cases. On the other hand, it increases linearly with the number of rules for the iptables case.</p>
<h3 id="test-5---setup-time">Test #5 - Setup Time</h3>
<p>This test aims to measure the time it takes to install the filtering rules on the system. It doesn’t take into consideration fixed times like loading the eBPF program, creating the IP sets but instead focuses on measuring the time it takes to update the rules themselves and how it changes with the number of rules.</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-09-10-egress-filtering-testing/setup.svg">
</figure>
<p>The above graph shows that the time required to set up the rules in all the filters increases linearly with the number of rules.</p>
<p>With 100.000 IPs, the setup time is still less than one second. For 1 million IPs, the setup time is less than 10 seconds. This shows that in practice, all 3 methods have an acceptable setup time.</p>
<p>The setup time is very dependent on the benchmark implementation rather than being inherent to the filtering method. Each filtering method could be optimised in the benchmark code if it were deemed necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the bpf filter: the benchmark performs one bpf() system call for every IP. From Linux 5.6, it is possible to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aa2e93b8e58e18442edfb2427446732415bc215e">perform several updates in a eBPF map with a single bpf() call</a>.</li>
<li>For the iptables and IP sets filters, the benchmark executes external commands and feeds each IP range individually over a pipe. We could avoid that by communicating the list to the kernel using the Netlink protocol directly. There are <a href="https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink/search?q=ipset&amp;type=Issues">some attempts</a> to implement IP Sets support in Golang with the vishvananda/netlink library.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, the reader should be cautious before comparing the setup time of one filter to another. This should not be interpreted as one method being better than another but rather to show expected setup performance and that setup time is unlikely to be a problem for any filtering method.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>In my journey learning 9 languages over the years, I tried all sorts of different methods to make my learning more effective. Here are some of the notable approaches, along with why they work (or don't work). It </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>will be a long learning journey</span></a> <span>, I hope this article will make yours more fun and effective. </span></p> <p><span>Let's jump right in.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Moving to the Target Country</span></h3></p> <p><span>In my experience learning a language, immersion is powerful. Being in a country where your target language is spoken is ideal. Your learning becomes always on, even if you don't realize it. </span></p> <p><span>I moved to Tokyo and worked at an all-Japanese company a few years ago. At the beginning I knew very little Japanese. But with this sink-or-swim approach and the daily immersion, I became comfortable with basic conversations within three months.</span></p> <p><span>Now, it is not always possible to just pack up and move to a different place. Read on for other tips I tested from my own experience. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Language Exchange Meetups</span></h3></p> <p><span>You can only get so good at speaking a language without talking to native speakers. Language exchange groups are a great way to get that conversational practice. In a typical event, you would get paired up/grouped with native speakers of your target language, who are themselves looking to level up on your native tongue. </span></p> <p><span>For half of the time, the group would converse in one language, and then switch to the other language half-way. If you live in a major city, there are usually quite a few of these groups for the common languages. </span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank"><span>Meetup</span></a> <span> is a great place to look for these events. This is an effective way to practice in your home city, or when you are already in your target country. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Online Language Exchange</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you are unable to attend in-person meetups, online language exchange can be effective as well. Though in-person conversations would always feel more organic, you still get the instant feedback and practice with online language exchange calls. </span></p> <p><span>I have made a few friends along the way, while practicing my German, French, and Japanese. I previously had a pleasant experience using </span> <a href="https://www.italki.com/" target="_blank"><span>iTalki</span></a> <span>, where I could easily find language partners and schedule 1-1 Skype calls with them. It was entirely free. But at the time of writing, it appears they may have removed the free partner option.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Learning Entire Phrases</span></h3></p> <p><span>I found it effective to memorize entire sentences, and pull them out when I need to. There are several benefits to this. When you are communicating in realtime, having phrases already memorized can reduce your stumbling. It can make you appear fluent and keep the conversation flowing. This also makes you feel more comfortable, knowing what to say or how to respond in a given situation.</span></p> <p><span>These familiar phrases serve as important anchors as well, for learning about the structure of the language, and for easily swapping out components to adapt to new situations. For example, after memorizing the phrase "After a few months of travelling, I am happy to finally be able to work with everyone", you can substitute some of the words and use it in a new scenario.</span></p> <p><span>Phrase books can be somewhat useful for this purpose, though it can sound scripted and unnatural. What feels more natural is writing down and remembering the response of native speaker in a real-life situation or in a movie.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Movies/Shows in Your Target Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>Movies and TV shows are a great source of natural-sounding phrases (though overly dramatic sometimes) to add to your knowledge bank. This is great for a number of reasons: </span></p> <p><li><span>You can usually figure out what the movie is about (especially if you first watch it in your native language).</span></li></p> <p><li><span>It is enjoyable, which means you will stick with it</span></li></p> <p><li><span>You get to learn about the culture behind your target language</span> <strong> </strong> <span>as well.</span></li></p> <p><span>And if you are watching it on TV, I find that even the commercials in your target language are interesting. Not only is it good practice, you get a better sense of what kinds of products local people buy and the messaging that appeals to them. With the growing selection of international shows/movies on Netflix, along with audio and/or subtitles, this is a fun and easy way to make progress.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Interviews with Subtitles and Translations</span></h3></p> <p><span>In addition to movies/shows, interviews are the perfect content for getting exposure to natural conversations, where people use casual everyday language. </span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/magauchsein" target="_blank"><span>Easy Languages</span></a> <span> on YouTube is hands down one of my favourite language resources. They interview people on the streets on a different topic each episode, and provide subtitles in the original language + English. Over the years, they have built up an amazing collection of content in many (!) languages.</span></p> <p><span>Here's a taste of their content for German learners: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLoatpfE7VM?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Passive Background Looping</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is one of the most effective hacks I developed to maximize my time spent learning a language. As I work, I would put on a familiar track of native speakers talking (much of the time it would be Easy Languages) in the ground. This way, I can get a lot of listening practice without spending much time. By picking content that you are already familiar with, you already know what is being talked about. And the looping gets you more "reps" for each phrase. It also helps you memorize entire phrases that you can use with ease later.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Podcasts </span></h3></p> <p><span>This one can be tricky. I have tried quite a few podcasts and many podcast formats aren't that conducive to learning a foreign language. Either I don't understand what's going on, or there is too much repeating over the often dry content. But for Japanese learners, I highly recommend </span> <a href="https://bilingualnews.libsyn.com/" target="_blank"><span>Bilingual News</span></a> <span> hosted by Michael and Mami. It features the hosts talking about interesting topics in the news, with Michael speaking only English and Mami speaking only Japanese. The conversation always moves forward and remains engaging, and you can usually easily fill in the words you missed from the context. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Ask a Native Speaker "How do I say X?" Wherever Possible</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you have friends (or better yet, roommates) from other countries, you can definitely get some practice in as you hang out. When you are trying to say something, why not learn to say it in your target language too? Anytime is learning time! You'll remember it much better than other methods because the learning takes place in real-life expeirences. I used to worry this may come off as annoying, but in my experience most people are happy to help, and appreciate the ernest effort you make to understand their language/culture. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Changing Your Phone's Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>One easy way to squeeze out an extra bit of language immersion is to simply change your mobile phone to your target language. Doing so should automatically update the language in all your apps as well. Since you likely already know how to navigate through most apps anyway, in most cases you can guess the meaning of new words that you don't yet know. With this, even Facebook notifications become good practice. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Taking classes</span></h3></p> <p><span>I have never been a fan of learning a language in a classroom, having taken Russian, French and Mandarin classs. This one is a bit of a hit or miss. The classroom environment has always felt a bit too artificial for this purpose. Typically, there is also limited practice, limited individual attention (and hence </span> <em>feedback</em> <span>). And the separation between the classroom learning context and the real-life situations makes it hard to apply the knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>That said, there are some amazing teachers out there who excel at teaching and building curriculum. And for some people, the structure of learning in a group guided by a competent instructor is just what they need. For Chinese learners, </span> <a href="https://www.excelmandarin.com/" target="_blank"><span>Excel Mandarin</span></a> <span> is an example of educators who have created an effective learning system for their students. Though not from my personal experience, I have heard nothing but positive reviews about these folks. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Duolingo</span></h3></p> <p><span>There was a time when I would have a long-running practice streak on the popular free app </span> <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank"><span>Duolingo</span></a> <span>. I would use the app daily, and almost completed the curriculum for Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and German. I felt great. I felt engaged. I felt like I was making progress. But that's the dangerous part about apps like these that try to "gamify" the language learning process. it makes you feel productive, even if it may not reflect reality. </span></p> <p><span>It is all too easy to slip into auto-pilot mode, where you just rush to the finish line of each exercise. This is similar to how one would "speed read" a book in an hour and retain nothing from it. The app also trains you to get used to the machine-generated bad pronunciation, which is counter-productive for your listening skills. On the bright side, Duolingo can be helpful for exposure to new words, and adding some structure to your learning, especially if you are not following a curriculum or textbook.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reading Textbooks</span></h3></p> <p><span>Reading a textbook for the purpose of language learning is perhaps the best way to learn the formal structure of a language. But it is not effective for conversational purposes. Grammar rules are clean, but conversational languages are messy. Similar to the discussion above about taking classes, textbooks tend to give a similar passive understanding of rules, as opposed to the ability to apply that knowledge in real-time. </span></p>  <p><span>The best approach is the one you actually take and follow through with. One that fits your learning objectives and learning style. The more you can align your learning with your intrinsic motivation, the more likely it is that it will stick. </span></p>

<p>After the sudden and miraculous shift to remote work in March – the office fightback has well and truly begun.</p>



<p>Four months ago I wrote that – surprisingly- there was no fightback from technophobe hold-outs barricading themselves into their offices. They simply packed up their laptop and went home with the rest of us. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank">How </a><a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/">premature</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank"> I was</a>. </p>

<p>If you thought that 2020 couldn’t get any crazier – it seems some people really are suggesting that businesses should alter their workplace strategies in order to save…sandwich shops.</p>



<p>OK, I’m exaggerating for effect. But there really has been a hand brake applied to the move to remote/hybrid working , or my favoured term,<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/work-futures/the-future-is-minimum-office-not-zero-office-821928abdba2" target="_blank"> minimum office</a></em> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/go-back-work-risk-losing-job-major-drive-launched-get-people/" target="_blank">article in the Daily Telegraph</a>&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that employees who continue to work at home will be more vulnerable to redundancy, with bosses finding it far easier get rid of people they don’t physically see.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1290987043829489666?s=20" target="_blank">Kirstie Allsopp</a> led the anti-remote work charge on Twitter, suggesting that if your job can be done from home, it can be done from anywhere in the world. Who would have thought that a couple of months of working in shorts and a T-Shirt has made us more susceptible to being replaced by less expensive folk in India, Myanmar and China? </p>



<p>A debate that is framed around saving sandwich shops and an already dying high street isn’t helpful or progressive. Cynically I might suggest the real subtext here is about propping up commercial property investment portfolios. Realistically though, we won’t see anything like a return to the same number of offices, and although few will shed tears for commercial real estate investors many small businesses will suffer a big hit and go out of business unless they can pivot very rapidly.</p>



<p>Clearly there are two groups emerging, those who are desperate for the pandemic to be viewed as a temporary event before everything returns to ‘normal’ and those embracing the true long term disruption that is occurring.</p>



<p>Thank heavens then for more balanced thinkers like Tom Cheesewright who has an uncanny ability to pan back and take the long view. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tomcheesewright.com/were-still-human/" target="_blank">Writing on his website</a> about the current over-confidence in the possibilities for remote working he says:</p>



<p><em>“There is something different about being there, in person, with all of your senses engaged. It’s what I called a few years ago, ‘<a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/the-unbeatable-bandwidth-of-being-there/">the unbeatable bandwidth of being there</a>‘. What gets transmitted and received through the screen and headset, mediated by a million miles of fibre optic cable, is not the full experience of meeting. Nor does it allow for all the things that happen around those meetings. <a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/aftershocks-and-opportunities/">I’ve talked at length about the need for peer support, the subtler parts of staff training, and the mutual inspiration that happens when you’re sharing a physical space</a>.”</em></p>



<p>I’m a remote working, or at least a minimum office, enthusiast. I’ve written on this site for years about the worst aspects of office life and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2014/07/31/why-the-death-of-the-office-cant-come-too-soon/" target="_blank">the most popular post on here applauds its impending doom</a>.  Six years on though I’d admit it’s a deeply flawed argument. The idea that constant interruptions and back to back meetings were a symptom of being in a corporate building has been well and truly busted by…Microsoft Teams. </p>



<p>In truth the problem with work is not the tools or the physical location, but <a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/01/03/ending-our-obsession-with-leadership/">the obsession with leadership</a> , an undue focus on work about work, an overbearing hierarchy and the lack of true digitisation of the enterprise. Deeper, more complex problems.  </p>



<p>It’s ironic that it has taken a pandemic to reveal what was good about the office. “The things that happen between meetings” that Tom writes about reveal our innate desire for human contact – the need to get <em>our senses fully engaged</em>. Wasteful? Quite often. But we dismiss this at our peril. It may seem logical that workplace chatter stifles productivity, but studies show the opposite to be true. </p>



<p>A narrow focus on efficiency in the workplace and a flawed view of what makes people productive is similarly regressive and likely to drag people back to the old normal. As Stowe Boyd writes the backlash against minimum office is in full flow , as detailed in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-start-to-think-remote-work-isnt-so-great-after-all-11595603397?mod=trending_now_pos1">Companies Start to Think Remote Work Isn’t So Great After All</a>, as executives want to get people back in the office:</p>



<p>“<em>An increasing number of executives now say that remote work, while necessary for safety much of this year, is not their preferred long-term solution once the coronavirus crisis passes.</em></p>



<p><em>“There’s sort of an emerging sense behind the scenes of executives saying, ‘This is not going to be sustainable,’” said Laszlo Bock, chief executive of human-resources startup Humu and the former HR chief at Google. No CEO should be surprised that the early productivity gains companies witnessed as remote work took hold have peaked and leveled off, he adds, because workers left offices in March armed with laptops and a sense of doom</em>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s simply we haven’t yet matched our colleagues roles, and their specific work preferences, within our existing organisational design never mind considered a future state. Working from home (managed and supported appropriately) <strong>can</strong> be more productive than going into the office.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUMuOwyAM_JpySwQkNHDgsJf9jYiA27BNIDKmVf5-aStZHsv2-DHeEdwznvbIhVgtgHMMdtRSX1nDILTSLJb5hgC7i5slrMCOumzRO4o5vdu1Mdqw1YZJTmJYQC9SaR8kv3IlBmcmM_qgRsXeS2ZXQ4TkwcIT8MwJ2GZXoqNchp-L_G22LthnvLdIcskbcN0cQgGHfu0eKb82CHfoXhkfgKVzCN2emzswh-opPqG7Yd67Ne_Aon2P4YYPQiiteC_6M_0JzqezJnMZ-X6XfalLIecfvc87Q3u4up0kWnGhmAgwAX1K7fW54V5TpHOG5JZ2ylcV-or4eZLOA2yCV9mAGvubbFIZOWmuWNsWctMzfShljTf6B3tch00" target="_blank">A HBR study published in August</a>&nbsp;contrasted surveys of knowledge workers from 2013 and 2020, found that remote working was in fact helping address long-held frustrations about the rhythm of office work. </p>



<ol><li>Lockdown helps us focus on the work that really matters. We are spending 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners.</li><li>Lockdown helps us take responsibility for our own schedules. We do 50% more activities through personal choice — because we see them as important — and half as many because someone else asked us to.</li><li>During lockdown, we view our work as more worthwhile.&nbsp; We rate the things we do as valuable to our employer&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to ourselves. The number of tasks rated as tiresome drops from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others drops from 41% to 27%.</li></ol>



<p>The key phrase here is: <em>managed and supported appropriately</em>. Certainly managers need to reinvent themselves as mentors to this style of working and then – forgive me – get the hell out of the way. </p>



<p>The office as the default way of working is dead. But the office itself isn’t dead. With working from home, what we gain in work-life balance we might lose in innovation and creativity. There are people who could directly challenge that sentence but I suspect they will come from highly mature companies who have fully mastered the remote working learning curve. Many of us are still at the stage of doing what we did in the office , just remotely. The timorous amongst us may use the lack of productivity net gains as a reason to regress rather than push through the ‘pain barrier’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/07/11/nirvana-or-business-as-usual-navigating-the-new-future-of-work/" target="_blank">as Matt Mullenweg describes it.</a> </p>



<p>We can do so much better, for ourselves, our customers and society if we stop being so frightened or so certain of the future. </p>



<p>We are going to have fewer offices and spend more time at home. </p>



<p>Our efforts would be a lot better spent improving the experience and outcomes of both rather than arguing about preserving a status quo whose time has truly run out. </p>



<p><em>The office versus remote work?</em> It’s not a binary choice we need to make. </p>



<p>The best thing you can do in any period of change is to bet on neither black or white. The future will be made up instead of shades of grey where few things are certain and <em>the best you can do to prepare is to be endlessly adaptable</em>. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A week ago, I've installed <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-05-openbsd-on-the-desktop-part-i.html">OpenBSD on my
Thinkpad</a>. I've been
using it now and then, and already have changed a couple of things in respect to
the original setup described in the article. I also installed OpenBSD on the
Dell Optiplex on which I <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-08-11-freebsd-on-the-desktop-part-i.html">previously installed
FreeBSD</a> a month
before. This means that I'm no longer using FreeBSD on the desktop, at least not
for the moment. However, FreeBSD is running on a disk station I built earlier
this summer. Maybe I'll describe that particular setup (using ZFS) in a later
article.</p>
<p>Except for that storage server, I'd like to use OpenBSD for most of my private
computing. In this article, I describe some GUI tweaks and additional setup
tasks I perfmormed in order to feel more at home on my OpenBSD machines. Some of
the tasks performed are <em>not</em> specific to OpenBSD, but could also be applied to
a Linux setup.</p>

<p><code>sudo</code> originally came from the OpenBSD community. It is almost as widely used
in the Unix world as SSH, which is the most prominent OpenBSD project.  However,
<code>sudo</code> became bigger and harder to configure. Therefore, Ted Unangst came up
with a simpler alternative called <code>doas</code>, which stands for <em>Dedicated OpenBSD
Application Subexecutor</em>. <code>doas</code> is less powerful than <code>sudo</code>, but much smaller,
easier to configure, and, thus, more secure. The full rationale can be read in
<a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/doas">Ted Unangst's Blog</a>.</p>
<p>A basic <code>doas</code> setup requires to login as root for one last time. The
configuration shall be kept extremely simple. I'd like to permit all users from
the <code>wheel</code> group (which is just me on my computers) to use <code>doas</code> without
entering the password every time but only once when executing a command that
requires <code>root</code> permissions. This is only a single line in <code>/etc/doas.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>permit persist :wheel
</code></pre>
<p>Let's check this setup by logging in as a user of the wheel group and trying to
update the packages:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add -u
</code></pre>
<p>This works, so bye bye <code>root</code> account.</p>

<p>By default, <code>dwm</code>, <code>dmenu</code>, and <code>st</code> use a monospace font of size 10, or
pixelsize 12, respectively, which is hard to read on a screen with a high
resolution. On Linux, I use the the TrueType font DejaVu Sans Mono. For OpenBSD,
I'd rather use something more minimalistic: the <a href="http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/">Terminus bitmap
font</a>.</p>
<p>As <code>pkg_info -Q terminus</code> shows, this font comes in different versions. I prefer
the version with the centered tilde, which I install:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add terminus-font-4.47p0-centered_tilde
</code></pre>
<p>Let's reconfigure <code>st</code> first, for testing changes doesn't require a restart of
the window manager. I stored my suckless sources in <code>~/suckless</code>, so the
font for <code>st</code> can be configured in <code>~/suckless/config.h</code>. I replace the existing
font configuration</p>
<pre><code>static char *font = "Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true";
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>static char *font = "Terminus:pixelsize=24";
</code></pre>
<p>The options <code>antialias</code> and <code>autohinting</code> are not needed for a bitmap font, so I
left them away. 24 pixels is rather big, but my screen is big enough to show two
text editors with more than 80 characters per line next to each other, so let's
keep it this way. I rebuild and reinstall <code>st</code>, then switch to <code>dwm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas make install
$ cd ../dwm
</code></pre>
<p>The font configuration in the <code>config.h</code> file looks a bit different here:</p>
<pre><code>static const char *fonts =      { "monospace:size=10" };
static const char dmenufont =   "monospace:size=10";
</code></pre>
<p>Let's just use the same font as for <code>st</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>static const char *fonts =      { "Terminus:pixelsize=24" };
static const char dmenufont =   "Terminus:pixelsize=24";
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I'm using <code>pixelsize</code> instead of <code>size</code> here. (24pt would be much
bigger than 24px.) Then I rebuild and reinstall <code>dwm</code>.</p>
<pre><code># make install
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration appllies also to <code>dmenu</code> and <code>slstatus</code>, so we're done with
the fonts.</p>

<p>By default, the desktop background is a pattern of black and grey dots, which is
a strain to the eye. Even though I rarely look at an empty desktop for long, I'd
rather change this to a solid color. This can be done by adding a command to
<code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>xsetroot -solid black
</code></pre>
<p>Right before <code>dwm</code> is executed.</p>

<p>Even though SSH is almost ubiquitous nowadays, a USB flash drive is still useful
when it comes to exchanging data between computers, especially if Windows is
involved, or if the network does not allow SSH.</p>
<p>Block storage devices are accessible through the device nodes <code>/dev/sd*</code>,
whereas <code>*</code> stands for the number of the disk. The disks can be listed as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ sysctl hw.disknames
hw.disknames=sd0:ef0268c97ae7a246
</code></pre>
<p>Only <code>sd0</code> is active, even though I already plugged in my USB dongle. However,
the system already figured out that there is a second disk:</p>
<pre><code>$ sysctl hw.diskcount
hw.diskcount=2
</code></pre>
<p>The next free disk would have the name <code>sd1</code>. The device nodes can be created by
running the <code>MAKEDV</code> script in <code>/dev</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /dev
$ doas sh MAKEDEV sd1
</code></pre>
<p>Let's initialize a new MBR partition schema on <code>sd1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas fdisk -iy sd1
</code></pre>
<p>The new disk layout can be checked using <code>disklabel</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas disklabel sd1
# /dev/rsd1c
...
</code></pre>
<p>The first line of the output tells us that there's a partition under
<code>/dev/rsd1c</code>. (The <code>r</code> refers to «raw», as opposed to «block».) The partition
can be formatted using <code>newfs</code> by referring to that partition name:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas newfs sd1c
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a default FFS (Fast File System) partition, which is useful to
exchange data between BSD operating systems. The formatted partition is then
ready to be mounted:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas mount /dev/sd1c /mnt
</code></pre>
<h2>Other Partition Types</h2>
<p>Other partition types are available under other utilities.</p>
<h3>FAT32</h3>
<p>The following command creates a FAT32 partition:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas newfs_msdos -F 32 sd1c
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-F 32</code> parameter specifies FAT32 (as opposed to FAT16 or FAT8). To mount
the partition, use the according <code>mount</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas mount_msdos /dev/sd1c /mnt
</code></pre>
<h3>EXT2</h3>
<p>In order to create an <code>ext2fs</code> file system, the partition type needs to be
specified accordingly. First, you might consider a GPT partition schema instead
of MBR (additional <code>-g</code> parameter):</p>
<pre><code>$ doas fdisk -igy sd1
</code></pre>
<p>Then use <code>disklabel</code> interactively to define a new partition:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas disklabel -E sd1
</code></pre>
<p>First, delete all the partitions with <code>z</code>. Then, create a new partition with
<code>a</code>, and make sure to specify the type as <code>ext2fs</code> instead of the default
<code>4.2BSD</code>. Notice that the new partition has a different letter (say, <code>a</code>), so
you need to use <code>sd1a</code> instead of <code>sd1c</code> for the next steps. Write the changes
by typing <code>w</code>, then exit with <code>q</code>. Now you can format and mount the partition:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas newfs_ext2fs sd1a
$ doas mount_ext2fs /dev/sd1a /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>In order to access my GitHub repositories, I first create a new SSH key:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
</code></pre>
<p>Since I manage my passwords with <code>pass</code> (of which more later), I don't know most
of them by heart. So I can't just login to GitHub and add my public key.
Therefore, I copy my public key to my laptop, on which I'm already logged in to
GitHub.</p>
<p>This can be either done using <code>scp</code>, for which <code>sshd</code> has to be running on my
laptop (which currently has the IP <code>192.168.178.53</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.178.53:/home/patrick
</code></pre>
<p>Or using the USB flash drive formatted with <code>ext2</code> from before:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas newfs_ext2fs -I sd1a
$ doas mount_ext2fs /dev/sd1a /mnt
$ doas cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /mnt/
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>id_rsa.pub</code> can be copied into the according <a href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/new">GitHub Settings
Page</a>, after which cloning GitHub
repositories should work on the OpenBSD machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:patrickbucher/conf
</code></pre>

<p>My passwords are encrypted using GPG. To encrypt them, I need to copy my private
key from my other machine. First, I list my private keys:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --list-keys --keyid-format SHORT
pub   rsa2048/73CE6620 2016-11-11 [SC]
      22F91EE20D641CBCF5B8678E82B7FE3A73CE6620
uid         [ultimate] Patrick Bucher &lt;patrick.bucher@mailbox.org&gt;
sub   rsa2048/AF6246E3 2016-11-11 [E]
</code></pre>
<p>Then I export both public and private key to an according file using the armored
key format:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg --export --armor 73CE6620 &gt; public.key
$ gpg --export-secret-key --armor 73CE6620 &gt; private.key
</code></pre>
<p>The two key files can be copied via SSH or the USB flash disk again, which I
won't show here.</p>
<p>Back on my OpenBSD machine, I need to install GnuPG first, because OpenBSD only
has <code>signify</code> installed by default:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gnupg
</code></pre>
<p>I pick the 2.2 version. Now I can import my keys:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg2 --import private.key
$ gpg2 --import public.key
</code></pre>
<p>The key is not trusted so far, so I need to change that:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg2 --edit-key 73CE6620
&gt; trust
&gt; 5
&gt; y
&gt; quit
</code></pre>
<p>5 stands for ultimate trust, which seems appropriate.</p>

<p>I use <code>pass</code> as a password manager, which can be installed as the
<code>password_store</code> package in OpenBSD:</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add password-store
</code></pre>
<p>Now that I have both my GPG private key and a working SSH key for GitHub, I can
clone my passwords stored on a private GitHub repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:patrickbucher/pass .password-store
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can copy my GitHub password to the clipboard as follows:</p>
<pre><code>$ pass -c github
</code></pre>

<p>I use a lot of aliases, such as <code>gcl</code> as a shortcut for <code>git clone</code>, and <code>gad</code>
for <code>git add</code>, etc. Since OpenBSD uses a Public Domain Korn Shell by default,
the <code>.bashrc</code> configuration from my Linux machines won't work here, unless I
switch to <code>bash</code>, which is not exactly the point of using OpenBSD.</p>
<p>I define my aliases in <code>~/.kshrc</code> (excerpt):</p>
<pre><code>alias gcl='git clone'
alias gad='git add'
</code></pre>
<p>In order to load those settings, an according <code>ENV</code> parameter needs to be
defined in <code>~/.profile</code> (see <code>man 1 ksh</code> for details):</p>
<pre><code>export ENV=$HOME/.kshrc
</code></pre>
<p>After the next login, <code>~/.profile</code> is reloaded, and the aliases are ready to be
used.</p>

<p>Not only is my enhanced setup now ready to do some serious work, but I also
increased my understanding of some OpenBSD subjects. There are still things to
be improved and to be understood, but my setup is now good enough so that I no
longer need a Linux machine running next to it. I'm looking forward to use and
learn about OpenBSD in the time to come. I'll write additional articles on the
subject as soon as I have enough subject material ready.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Growth startups often find themselves lacking senior team members as they scale. The problems that arise from this are plentiful, including things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requiring heroics to fix things</li>
  <li>Penalizing junior team members for failure to meet responsibilities well above their pay grade.</li>
  <li>Building technology that doesn’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some reasons why companies get into this situation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-habit">Reason 1: Habit</h2>

<p>When you’re a tiny startup budgets are extremely lean and products don’t have a lot of users. In that environment companies often prioritize breadth of functionality (see what works) and getting that via several (more affordable) junior team members guided by a smaller group of senior team members.</p>

<p>Problems arise if that strategy exists past market fit. The add-a-junior-to-do-more strategy implodes as the team grows too large for the senior staff to manage closely and the technical challenges start to look more daunting.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-hubris">Reason 2: Hubris</h2>

<p>Sometimes people recognize the problems are getting more difficult but still don’t hire more seniors. This can often be chalked up to hubris - surely I can just direct a bunch of juniors to execute on the genius solutions I come up with for all our problems. The problem here is that you’re not a genius and even if you were that strategy doesn’t scale.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-fear">Reason 3: Fear</h2>

<p>The flip side of hubris is fear. New senior staff can look like a threat to the power of existing senior staff. You might have to choose between doing what’s right for the company and retaining certain kinds of power. The answer there is simple - it’s better to be part of something great than the owner of something that fails.</p>

<p>A different play on this theme is junior teammates fearing that new senior teammates will take away some of their opportunities. It’s possible, sure. But more often the opportunities they will take over are the ones juniors would have had trouble succeeding in.</p>

<p>In a growing company with reasonably difficult challenges, good seniors will do more to expand the set of opportunities than shrink them. And good senior talent will help juniors via mentorship and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4-money-issues">Reason 4: Money Issues</h2>

<p>Money issues play out in a couple ways.</p>

<p>First, the cost of senior talent can subconsciously make you concerned about the remaining budget for yourself. I haven’t seen this played out directly and blatantly, but it’s another version of the fear game - assuming compensation is a zero sum game leads to weird incentives.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easy to think 2 juniors are better than one senior. As you read about the myth of the 10x engineer you might find yourself thinking this way. Let’s talk more about how this is a misconception in reason 5…</p>

<h2 id="reason-5-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-for-right-now">Reason 5: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills For Right Now</h2>

<p>As referenced earlier, problems get much harder when you add significant growth to a platform. It’s not uncommon to underestimate the challenges at hand. In reality, even simple products at massive scale need significant senior leadership to ensure they are being built and operated effectively. Trying to replace the leadership of senior talent with a volume of junior talent is a sure-fire way to screw this up.</p>

<h2 id="reason-6-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-in-the-future">Reason 6: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills In the Future</h2>

<p>To make things more difficult, you don’t just have to hire for right now, you have to hire for 2 or more years in the future. The senior talent you hire now must seed the leadership ranks you need in the future. Especially in product and engineering, you can’t just hire everyone you need when you need them. For starters, the job market would laugh at that sort of just-in-time attempt at hiring. But also, these roles require much more detailed understanding of the systems at play, so you need to have people with intimate knowledge developed in advance.</p>

<p>Think of it this way - look at whatever company you’re trying to be like in 5 years. Look at their team. If you don’t start hiring towards something like that team sooner rather than later you’ll never be that company.</p>

<h2 id="reason-7-arguments-about-what-seniors-need">Reason 7: Arguments About What-Seniors-Need</h2>

<p>Another reason people hire too junior is thinking around senior talent needing explicit areas of responsibility that don’t overlap. This is the “one alpha” theory - that senior talent can’t collaborate productively and need their own pack. There might be some nuggets of truth here, but most of it is nonsense. That’s like NASA saying they couldn’t have smart people work together on getting to the moon because these great scientists need their own domains.</p>

<p>Ultimately you have to look at the problems you’re solving. If they are truly challenging they can support a number of seniors. If they aren’t you’ll probably have trouble hiring and retaining more than a few.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons why you might hire too junior as your company grows. Know them and hire intentionally.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
<p>Back in the days, rendering a website was simple. You needed a web server that served HTML files. Those were <strong>static sites</strong>. Then developers started using databases and authentication. To achieve that, they needed to manipulate the HTML file before serving it. That's how <strong>server-side</strong> rendering was born. Let's fast forward until 2010, when Backbone got released. The front-end got richer and more complex. Then the era of <strong>client-side</strong> applications begin. Developers migrated their data and routing logic to the client side. They could, because Google "understood" JavaScript. The servers became slimmer, but the websites became more complex. Yet, recently server-side rendering became a trend again. All thanks to React and its server-side hydration feature.</p>
<h2 id="static-sites">Static sites</h2>
<p>Static sites are the simplest way to render a website. You code your website in HTML/CSS, and serve those files from a web server. This is the simplest way to render your website, but it comes with pros and cons.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599911023781/_11mpV_GL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Static Site Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>Since they're static, you <strong>cannot</strong> have dynamic data. To update the data on your static site, you need to edit your HTML files, and deploy them again.</p>
<p>That also means that your visitors won't be able to "contribute" to the website data. They can't leave comments, or create their own posts, or "like" your content.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>But, since there's no "computation" in static sites, they are the fastest to render. The server serves the HTML file, and the browser starts "drawing" immediately. This gives your website <strong>fast TTFB</strong> (time-to-first-byte) <strong>score</strong>.</p>
<p>Another benefit that static sites have is the ability to host them on CDNs. A CDN (content delivery network) is a network of servers distributed around the world. Meaning, your website will "live" on <strong>many servers at the same time</strong>. Also, CDNs are <strong>cheaper</strong> than dedicated servers!</p>
<p>They're also <strong>more secure</strong>. There is no back-end. That means there's less room for your site to suffer an attack, or your database to get compromised.</p>
<p>So, if you need to create a website that doesn't update the data on a regular basis, static site might be the best for you. Your site will be <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>cheap</strong>, and <strong>more secure</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="client-side-rendering">Client-side rendering</h2>
<p>Client-side apps are like static sites, but they use JavaScript to fetch their data. The server serves an HTML file with JavaScript inside, and the browser starts executing. This method also gives you a <strong>fast TTFB score</strong>, but the <strong>TTI</strong> (time to interactive) is slow, since there's no data right away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599911729267/IA0khVN4z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Client Side Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The TTI in this case depends on the user's internet speed and the amount of data requests. So, you need to be very careful when to trigger your data requests. But, there's nothing you can do about the user's internet speed.</p>
<p>Also, different browsers have different support for scripts. This means that you need to <strong>invest more into testing</strong> your CSA.</p>
<p>If a user decides to disable JavaScript, your website would be <strong>blank</strong>.</p>
<p>To fetch the data, you will need an API. That's an <strong>extra responsibility</strong>. When building APIs, you also need to think about <strong>security</strong> and <strong>data access</strong>. If you leave your API routes open without authentication, someone can make a mess.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>You have <strong>dynamic data</strong>! You won't need to edit files to update your website. Also, your website can be <strong>interactive</strong>. With dynamic data, you can make forums, social networks, tools, and all kinds of platforms.</p>
<p>You can implement authentication. With that, each user can have a <strong>personalized experience</strong> on your website.</p>
<p>Client-side apps can be <strong>SPAs</strong> (single page applications). That means the routing is completely on the client side, and it's instant! Because users don't have to wait for the server to respond when navigating between your pages.</p>
<h2 id="server-side-rendering">Server-side rendering</h2>
<p>Server-side rendering is an old and mature way of rendering the websites. There are tons of tools to help you achieve SSR. It's like CSR, but the data and routing logic lives on the server. When requesting a page, the server fetches the data and inlines it in the HTML file. That file is then served to the user, and the browser starts rendering right away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599912119788/UgnjWZ4s-.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Server Side Diagram"></p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The TTFB is <strong>slower</strong>. The browser needs to wait for the server to fetch the data and prepare the HTML for your page.</p>
<p>The server will also be <strong>busier</strong>. It needs to visit the database and prepare the HTML file every time a user navigates between your pages.</p>
<p>When navigating between pages a <strong>full page reload</strong> needs to happen.</p>
<h3 id="pros"><strong>Pros</strong></h3>
<p>SSR websites are <strong>SEO friendly</strong>! The search engines can get and index your data without executing extra scripts. Also, they can get the localized version, so you have better SEO for your supported languages.</p>
<p>The content gets served <strong>faster</strong>. This is because usually the servers have better internet connection than the users. Also, servers are more performant than the users' machine.</p>
<p>The user's machine is <strong>less busy</strong>. The browser only needs to take care of rendering, not data fetching and executing scripts.</p>
<p>The SSR method can also <strong>fix</strong> the issues with social sharing and the OpenGraph system.</p>
<p>You also have <strong>dynamic data</strong>. Every time the user lands on your page, the server fetches and serves the freshest data.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-incremental-static-regeneration">Bonus: Incremental Static Regeneration</h2>
<p>This method gets the static site speed of rendering and the server-side data fetching. This is what <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next JS</a> introduced in <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration">version 9.5</a>. So ISR "builds" the static HTML files on build time, but then it rebuilds them every time there's traffic on the site. The rebuilding happens in the background. That means the users are immediately presented with a static HTML file. If the data changes, the server rebuilds that page and starts serving the new version from there on.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>The server has <strong>less</strong> load than SSR, but <strong>more</strong> load than CSA or Static. But you <strong>can</strong> configure this. The server rebuilds the page after a user requests it and there's new data. That happens on configurable intervals. You can tell the server to revalidate the page on X seconds. So, if you expect frequent data changes set the revalidation interval to a smaller value. If not, you can set the revalidation interval to be, for example, once per day.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>Well, you have <strong>dynamic data</strong> which gets served in a <strong>static way</strong>. You have <strong>fast TTFB</strong> score, but also <strong>fast TTI</strong>.</p>
<p>Because it's static, you get <strong>great SEO</strong> our of the box.</p>
<p>Next JS has a <strong>fallback mechanism</strong> for dynamic pages. Let's say you have a blog that's using the ISR method. Your posts route would be something like <code>/posts/[post-slug]</code>. When you write a new post and publish it, you will only need to open the URL and Next JS will render that post page static. When you open that post again, it will be served immediately.</p>
<p>There's <strong>no full page reload</strong> when navigating between pages. Next JS prefetches the data for the pages that can be accessed from the current page.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The web development world has seen a significant change, and it will keep changing. In this post we got introduced to 4 methods of rendering websites. We explored the pros and cons and now have a good understanding of them. But, there is no holy grail. If you need to develop a very simple website, SSR or CSA will be an overkill, so you can use Static. If you need to develop a blog platform, or a forum, then SSR or CSA will be your best friend. Before deciding which method to use, write down the things that you need to have. Should your site have great SEO? Or dynamic data is the most important factor? Do you need to serve the website on a CDN? This list will help you choose the most suitable method.</p>

    <p>Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/orange_8361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Tsai</a></p><p>This is a cross-post blog from <a href="https://devco.re/" target="_blank">DEVCORE</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://devco.re/blog/2020/09/12/how-I-hacked-Facebook-again-unauthenticated-RCE-on-MobileIron-MDM/" target="_blank">ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆè«‹å�ƒé–±é€™è£¡</a></p>
    <p>Hi, it’s a long time since my last article. This new post is about my research this March, which talks about how I found vulnerabilities on a leading Mobile Device Management product and bypassed several limitations to achieve
        unauthenticated RCE. All the vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor and got fixed in June. After that, we kept monitoring large corporations to track the overall fixing progress and then found that Facebook didn’t keep up
        with the patch for more than 2 weeks, so we dropped a shell on Facebook and reported to their Bug Bounty program!</p>
    <p>This research is also presented at <a href="http://hitcon.org/2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HITCON 2020</a>. You can check the slides <a href="https://hitcon.org/2020/slides/How%20I%20Hacked%20Facebook%20Again!.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    
    <p>
        As a Red Teamer, we are always looking for new paths to infiltrate the corporate network from outside. Just like
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/#infiltrating-corporate-intranet-like-nsa---pre-auth-rce-on-leading-ssl-vpns-15545" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our research in Black Hat USA last year</a>, we
        demonstrated how leading SSL VPNs could be hacked and become your Virtual “Public” Network! SSL VPN is trusted to be secure and considered the only way to your private network. But, what if your trusted appliances are insecure?
    </p>
    <p>Based on this scenario, we would like to explore new attack surfaces on enterprise security, and we get interested in MDM, so this is the article for that!</p>
    <h2 id="What-is-MDM">
        <a href="#What-is-MDM" title="What-is-MDM"><i></i></a>What is MDM?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mobile Device Management, also known as MDM, is an asset assessment system that makes the employees’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BYOD</a> more manageable for
        enterprises. It was proposed in 2012 in response to the increasing number of tablets and mobile devices. MDM can guarantee that the devices are running under the corporate policy and in a trusted environment. Enterprise could manage
        assets, install certificates, deploy applications and even lock/wipe devices remotely to prevent data leakage as well.
    </p>
    <p>UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) is a newer term relevant to MDM which has a broader definition for managed devices. Following we use MDM to represent similar products!</p>
    <h2 id="Our-target">
        <a href="#Our-target" title="Our-target"><i></i></a>Our target
    </h2>
    <p>
        MDM, as a centralized system, can manage and control all employees’ devices. It is undoubtedly an ideal asset assessment system for a growing company. Besides, MDM must be reachable publicly to synchronize devices all over the
        world. A centralized and public-exposing appliance, what could be more appealing to hackers?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we have seen hackers and APT groups abusing MDM these years! Such as phishing victims to make MDM a C&amp;C server of their mobile devices, or even compromising the corporate exposed MDM server to push malicious Trojans
        to all devices. You can read the report <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/malicious-mdm-lets-hide-this-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malicious MDM: Let’s Hide This App</a> by Cisco Talos team and
        <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/mobile-as-attack-vector-using-mdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First seen in the wild - Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector</a> by CheckPoint CPR team for more details!
    </p>
    <p>
        From previous cases, we know that MDM is a solid target for hackers, and we would like to do research on it. There are several MDM solutions, even famous companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Apple have their own MDM solution. Which
        one should we start with?
    </p>
    <p>We have listed known MDM solutions and scanned corresponding patterns all over the Internet. We found that the most prevalent MDMs are VMware AirWatch and MobileIron!</p>
    <p>
        So, why did we choose MobileIron as our target? According to their official website, more than 20,000 enterprises chose MobileIron as their MDM solution, and most of our customers are using that as well. We also know Facebook has
        exposed the MobileIron server <a href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. We have analyzed Fortune Global 500 as well,
        and found more than 15% using and exposing their MobileIron server to the public! Due to above reasons, it became our main target!
    </p>
    <h2 id="Where-to-Start">
        <a href="#Where-to-Start" title="Where-to-Start"><i></i></a>Where to Start

        From <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13968/Mobileiron.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">past vulnerabilities</a>, we learned there aren’t too many researchers diving into MobileIron. Perhaps the
        attack vector is still unknown. But we suspect the main reason is that the firmware is too hard to obtain. When researching an appliance, turning a pure BlackBox testing into GrayBox, or WhiteBox testing is vital. We spent lots of
        time searching for all kinds of information on the Internet, and ended up with an RPM package. This RPM file is supposed to be the developer’s testing package. The file is just sitting on a listable WebRoot and indexed by Google
        Search.

    <p>After a painful time solving the dependency hell, we set the testing package up finally. The component is based on Java and exposed three ports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>443 - the user enrollment interface</li>
        <li>8443 - the appliance management interface</li>
        <li>9997 - the MobileIron device synchronization protocol (MI Protocol)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All opened ports are TLS-encrypted. Apache is in the front of the web part and proxies all connections to backend, a Tomcat with Spring MVC inside.</p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s2048/2020-09-06_230414.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/2020-09-06_230414.png"></a></p><p>Due to the Spring MVC, it’s hard to find traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS from a single view. Therefore, examining the logic and architecture is our goal this time!</p>
    <p>
        Talking about the vulnerability, the root cause is straightforward. Tomcat exposed a Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. However, this doesn’t mean we can do everything! The main effort of this article is
        to solve that, so please see the exploitation below.
    </p>
    <p>Although we know the Web Service deserializes the user input, we can not trigger it. The endpoint is located on both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User enrollment interface - <code>https://mobileiron/mifs/services/</code></li>
        <li>Management interface - <code>https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We can only touch the deserialization through the management interface because the user interface blocks the Web Service access. It’s a critical hit for us because most enterprises won’t expose their management interface to the
        Internet, and a management-only vulnerability is not useful to us so that we have to try harder. :(
    </p>
    <p>Scrutinizing the architecture, we found Apache blocks our access through Rewrite Rules. It looks good, right?</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://<span>%{SERVER_NAME}</span>:8443/mifs/services/<span>$1</span><span> [R=307,L]</span>
<span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services<span> [F]</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>MobileIron relied on Apache Rewrite Rules to block all the access to Web Service. It’s in the front of a reverse-proxy architecture, and the backend is a Java-based web server.</p>
    <p>Have you recalled something?</p>
    
    <p>
        Yes, the <a href="https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Parser Logic</a>! It’s the reverse proxy attack surface I

        between the Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and reaccess the Web Service. BTW, this excellent technique is also applied to the recently

    <p>OK, now we have access to the deserialization wherever it’s on enrollment interface or management interface. Let’s go back to exploitations!</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moritz Bechler</a> has an awesome research which summarized the Hessian deserialization vulnerability on his whitepaper,
        <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Java Unmarshaller Security</a>. From the
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marshalsec</a> source code, we learn the Hessian deserialization triggers the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashcode()</code> while reconstructing a
        <code>HashMap</code>. It could also trigger the <code>toString()</code> through the <code>XString</code>, and the known exploit gadgets so far are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache XBean</li>
        <li>Caucho Resin</li>
        <li>Spring AOP</li>
        <li>ROME EqualsBean/ToStringBean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our environment, we could only trigger the Spring AOP gadget chain and get a JNDI Injection.</p>

        Once we have a JNDI Injection, the rest parts of exploitations are easy! We can just leverage <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a>’s work,

    <p>
        Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a> introduced this on Black Hat, we could
        say that this technique helps countless security researchers and brings Java deserialization vulnerability into a new era. However, Java finally mitigated the last JNDI/LDAP puzzle in
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u181-relnotes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2018</a>. After that, all java version higher than 8u181, 7u191, and 6u201 can no longer get code execution through
        JNDI remote URL-Class loading. Therefore, if we exploit the Hessian deserialization on the latest MobileIron, we must face this problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Java changed the default value of <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase</code> to <code>False</code> to prevent attackers from downloading remote URL-Class to get code executions. But only this has been prohibited. We can
        still manipulate the JNDI and redirect the Naming Reference to a local Java Class!
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept is a little bit similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return-Oriented Programming</a>, utilizing a local existing Java Class to do further
        exploitations. You can refer to the article <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java</a> by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/artsploit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Stepankin</a> in early 2019 for details. It describes the attack on POST-JNDI exploitations and how to abuse the Tomcat’s <code>BeanFactory</code> to
        populate the <code>ELProcessor</code> gadget to get code execution. Based on this concept, researcher <a href="https://github.com/welk1n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welkin</a> also provides another <code>ParseClass</code> gadget
        on Groovy. As described in <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/Welk1n/p/11066397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his (Chinese) article</a>:

        <p><span>I</span>t was in 1752 that Linnaeus gave jellyfish the alternative name â€˜medusaâ€™ from the Greek myth of the same name. The term was well chosen. The bell of a jellyfish is a reminder of the head of the Gorgon sister, with its tentacles, like snakes, substituting for hair. Both the mythical Medusa and her animal counterpart were capable of causing paralysis and even death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the version of the Medusa myth found in Ovidâ€™s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, Medusa, one of three Gorgon sisters, was originally depicted as a great beauty whose attractive powers did not go unnoticed. Her hair was only transformed into serpents by the goddess Athena as a punishment. Medusa had been ravished by the sea god Poseidon in Athenaâ€™s own temple and because the temple had been defiled, Athena gave Medusa the power to change any human who looked upon her into stone. Perseus, the son of Zeus and half-brother of Athena, was asked by Polydectes to secure the head of Medusa. Instead of gazing on the Gorgon sister and risking being petrified, Perseus used the reflection on his shield to guide him while removing Medusaâ€™s head with his sword. From her decapitated torso sprang two children, Pegasus, a flying horse, and Chrysaor, a warrior with a golden sword. The transformative powers of Medusaâ€™s head were retained following its separation from the body and when Perseus laid down the head on the seashore, the escaping blood was said to be the origin of red coral (intriguing, knowing the close relationship that exists between jellyfish and coral).&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Caravaggioâ€™s depiction of Medusa, painted towards the end of the sixteenth century, echoes her destructive yet beautiful power while another painting, initially thought to be by Leonardo da Vinci, was to inspire a famous poem by Shelley:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>â€™Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror; <br>For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare <br>Kindled by that inextricable error,<br>Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air <br>Become a [ ] and ever-shifting mirror.<br>Of all the beauty and the terror there-
A womanâ€™s countenance, with serpent locks, <br>Gazing in death on heaven from those wet rocks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A more up-to-date version of Medusa is seen in Frank Mooreâ€™s painting <em>To Die For</em>. It features the model Kate Moss, her severed head alive with serpents. It was a painting commissioned by Gianni Versace, who never saw it since he was killed before Moore had completed the work. Moore himself died prematurely of AIDS in 2002, aged 48. The picture featured in an exhibition in New York called <em>Toxic Beauty: The Art of Frank Moor</em>e.<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_805b7becd4587e52023de0fe709ad787.jpg" alt="Medusa_by_Carvaggio"><figcaption><span>A ceremonial shield depicting the severed head of Medusa, painted in the late 16th century by Caravaggio. </span><br><span>Wikimedia Commons</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In her poem â€˜Medusa,â€™ Sylvia Plath successfully combines the mythical creature and the sea animal. Written shortly before her own death, it portrays her mother, with whom she had a difficult relationship, as a destructive monster clinging to her by a â€˜cableâ€™, akin to a jellyfish tentacle, and intent on controlling, indeed paralysing, her. It is as though Plath felt the need to exorcize her mother from her life in order to achieve some emotional distance, as well as to afford her greater freedom to write and compose. Plath could be said to have used the device of the snake-haired Gorgon to describe her own internal image of a monstrous mother. Ironically, her mother shared her first name with that of a common genus of jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Freud came to regard Medusaâ€™s head as a symbol of castration. In a short, posthumously published essay, â€˜Das Medusenhauptâ€™, he equates decapitation with being castrated, arguing that when a boy views female genitalia for the first time he suddenly realizes the possession of a penis cannot be taken for granted, leading to a specific anxiety about castration. In the same way, glimpsing the Medusaâ€™s head causes a male observer to be struck dumb, on the one hand fascinated by what he sees and, on the other, paralysed with fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Medusa myth, with its built-in ambiguity (deadly but fascinating), has served to reinforce our own ambivalence towards this sea creature. It may also have created a reluctance on the part of scientists to work with these animals. There is however no doubting that, when seen in its natural environment, the jellyfish displays that other, more positive quality, an ability to hold our attention, indeed to fascinate. This is explored in Marianne Mooreâ€™s poem â€˜A Jelly-fishâ€™, where the creature exerts â€˜a fluctuating charmâ€™.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jellyfish escape as quickly as they appear and while they may be allowed to touch us, they themselves often resist capture. They appear both alluring and elusive. The very nature of their movement contributes to their ethereal beauty, and where better to observe this than in a tropical lagoon? The Raja Ampat islands off West Papua boast several. Others can be found on the Kakaban islands off Borneo. In both places the jellyfish have lost their ability to sting humans, making it possible to appreciate their delicacy and movement in safety. In the Ampat islands, the lagoons are connected to the ocean through underwater channels that limit the entry and exit of seawater. In addition, the water there is stratified into an oxygen-rich surface layer where the jellyfish live and a deeper layer, devoid of oxygen, where they are absent. Two genera of jellyfish, the so-called golden jellyfish, <em>Mastigias</em>, and the moon jellyfish, <em>Aurelia</em>, coexist there. The species of <em>Mastigias</em> found in Ampat has lost the spots on its bell and oral arms and the marine biologist Michael Dawson believes this indicates a new subspecies has evolved there with no appreciable sting, presumably as the result of geographical isolation.</p>
<p>The slow, seemingly directionless pulsation of jellyfish can have a calming effect and lends itself to hospital and general practice waiting rooms, a feature as yet unexploited. Its languid movement calls into question how efficient this is as a means of locomotion. Work done at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts is providing the answer. It seems that jellyfish have a special way of recapturing some of the energy expended on each swimming stroke. When a medusa contracts its bell, it creates two vortex rings. The first is shed in its wake, propelling the animal forwards. The second, during the relaxa- tion phase, rolls under the bell. This second vortex ring spins faster than the first and, as it does so, sucks in water which pushes up against the underside of the bell, giving the jellyfish a second- ary boost. It is a technique that works only at slow speeds and when the body size is small. The conclusion reached by Brad Gemmell and his team at Woods Hole is that a jellyfish expends less energy in travelling a given distance than any other marine animal so far studied. Its efficiency, however, comes at a price, namely low speed and virtually no maneuverability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the humble jellyfish as a primitive automaton, unable to modify its movement and behaviour. By attaching accelerometers to the barrel jellyfish, <em>Rhizostoma pulmo</em>, it has been shown that it is able to orientate its swimming in relation to the direction of the tides. When the tide withdraws from the shore, this particular jellyfish orientates itself so as to swim against the current. When the tide flows towards the shore, it also swims in a consistent direction, either with or against the current, depending on the depth of the water. This appears to be a mechanism for keeping jellyfish together as a swarm and avoiding their becoming stranded on the shore.</p>

</center>
<p>The fascination that jellyfish engender in us deepens when we consider recent discoveries about another aspect of their behaviour, one which mirrors our own. In the so-called upside- down jellyfish, <em>Cassiopea</em>, it is possible to witness periods of diminished activity resembling sleep from which the creature is only slowly aroused (reminiscent of our own behaviour when sleep deprived). Like us, this jellyfish becomes â€˜sleepyâ€™ when exposed to the naturally occurring chemical melatonin. Sleep, or at least periods of cyclical inactivity, would appear to have arisen early on in evolution, well in advance of the possession of advanced nervous systems.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Earlier in the book, I stressed how the anatomy and the life cycle of jellyfish proved to be more complex than previously imagined. The behaviour of jellyfish in their natural habitat is proving equally complicated. We know that migrations of jellyfish in a horizontal direction are guided by the position of the sun. The golden jellyfish in Palau, for example, follow the sunâ€™s arc across the sky. Before sunrise, they cluster at the western end of Jellyfish Lake. With the dawn, they swim in an easterly direction towards the light, following the sun until they reach the eastern shore. As the sun continues towards the western horizon, the jellyfish reverse their course and return to the western shore to await the new day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vertical migration also occurs. Using echo sounders in a deep Norwegian fjord, the movements of individual helmet jellyfish,&nbsp; <em>Periphylla</em> <em>periphylla</em>, were monitored. This species of jellyfish segregates itself into assemblages. Each assemblage shows a different preference as far as vertical positioning in the water is concerned. Night-time groups congregate for the purpose of feeding and reproduction while other groups form for brief periods in other situations, only to disperse and then re-group. It has been suggested that this represents a type of social behaviour and …</p></article></div>

<p>TL;DR – this is not nearly good enough in most cases and it’s only small fraction of what you are paid for.</p>



<p>I want this post to be the canonical place to refer people to who say “but it works” because people who explain why this is not OK are tired of repeating the same arguments, me included.</p>



<h2>You are paid for …</h2>



<p>Following is not an exhaustive list but it should give you some perspective which is opposite from the narrow-minded “but it works”.</p>



<p>Typically, your Software Engineering $Job pays you for:</p>

<p>12 Sep 2020</p>
<p>
So it's been almost a year since I made the jump from team offense to team
defense.
</p>

<p>
I spent so long in a pure offense focused org that the pivot into thinking
about defensive problems was a bit jarring at first.
</p>

<p>
Not in the least because the economics of bug hunting in offense vs bug
hunting in defense are completely upside down.
</p>

<p>
Offense is goal oriented. You establish what you want to achieve, and audit
accordingly. Tending to your attack surface garden until you've grown all the
ingredients you need to complete your soup of the 0day.
</p>

<p>
On the defense side you're stuck trying to extrapolate from the ghosts of
haxmas past. And while there's certainly heaps of known and novel attack
research out there these days … at the end of the day you are going up
against an attacker who's goals, timelines, and resources are essentially
unknown.
</p>

<p>
And that blind spot still makes all the difference.
</p>

<p>
So we play the mitigation game.
</p>

<p>
Assume the code is borky and plop it in a sandbox, a hypervisor, a chromebook
wrapped in tinfoil running on the neighbors wifi …
</p>

<p>
Shuffle the memory. Make it non-executable. Hell, make it non-readable! Sign
the pointers. Validate the control flows. Cookie all the things. Heap
integrity checks. SMEP/SMAP/SMOP/SMUP …
</p>

<p>
Oh right, the hardware. Assume the hardware is broken. De-optimize. Slow
things down. Duplicate all the things at every privilege level.
</p>

<p>
Prevent the side-effect.
</p>

<p>
Stop the unknown.
</p>

<p>
PULL THE PLUG!
</p>

<p>
Phew.
</p>

<p>
Quite a bit of advanced exploit development happens out in the open now, and
Arxiv is, apparently, the new Phrack.
</p>

<p>
Who woulda thunk it?
</p>

<p>
You can even get a PhD based on offense research these days. And not some
handwavy diatribe that yammers on about polymorphic shellcode detection
either, no, the real thing.
</p>

<p>
Systems engineering teams try to distill the lessons on display into ever
advancing mitigations.
</p>

<p>
Exploit teams accept the challenge.
</p>

<p>
Round and round it goes, and the complexity bar keeps getting raised.
</p>

<p>
If you missed the era where most of this stuff happened out of sheer rage or
curiosity in the dark corners of IRC channels … that sound you hear in the
background is the slightly nervous chuckle of 40-something hackers world wide
as they start to worry about aging out of the game.
</p>

<p>
It's easy to confuse complexity for efficacy, especially when they're equally
headache inducing.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of talk about the importance of establishing exploitability in
some sort of automated way. The idea being that you can only properly
prioritize which bugs to fix through proven exploitability.
</p>

<p>
I go back and forth on this myself.
</p>

<p>
The obvious argument is that yes, if a bug has provable security impact, then
it deserves to be prioritized.
</p>

<p>
I think where it gets tricky is with the idea of exploitability. Exploitability
is a weird term. It sounds like an objective valuation.
</p>

<p>
A true/false.
</p>

<p>
But exploitability is really a function of subjective attacker motivation,
experience, resources, and skill.
</p>

<p>
So, for all intents and purposes, the best you can do is establish
exploitability based on what you, the defender, know about exploitation in
relation to how and where your assets are deployed and under which threat
models you practically operate.
</p>

<p>
Ben Hawkes has some solid thoughts[1] on the subject in terms of "equivalence
classes". Match the conditions in which bug A manifests itself to the known
exploitable conditions of bug B and if there's sufficient overlap then you can
make a reasonable assumption of exploitability.
</p>

<p>
If not, then go pay someone to try and write the exploit and stack the result
of that effort into your hackonomicon.
</p>

<p>
Many moons ago I wrote a whitepaper[2] for Microsoft on the subject when they
first came out with the "exploitability index". I tried to argue along similar
lines then, but I think the main difference anno 2020 is that the quality of
the public body of exploitation knowledge is much higher.
</p>

<p>
Julien Vanegue recently also made some interesting arguments[3] in favor of
exploitability-based triage prioritization and where the state of the
art is currently lacking.
</p>

<p>
All debate aside, his exploitability Venn diagram is much prettier than mine.
</p>

<p>
One of the harder practical problems to tackle in the exploitability realm is
that the problem space starts to explode when you combine platform
configurations with software ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
Every layer of the attack surface vertical introduces a massive growth of
potential exploitability that you now have to reason about.
</p>

<p>
VuSec's recent work[4], which combines their speculative execution
vulnerability research with a more traditional software vulnerability, is a
great example of what happens when someone goes "now kiss!" to security
assumptions based on disjointed threat models.
</p>

<p>
So probably the best you can hope for is some limited interpretation of Ben
and Julien's ideas, and apply it to some specific subset of your code, in some
known and static platform configuration. The more you can limit the threat
model exponents, the more practical automated decision making regarding
exploitability becomes.
</p>

<p>
But, that does not factor in the transubstantiative nature of bugs in terms of
exploit development. Many successful exploits are in fact a combination of
bugs. Independently those bugs might not represent an exploitable
vulnerability, but in concert, they do.
</p>

<p>
Or, even more fun, one bug becomes multiple exploit primitives. Julien touches
on this a bit in his section on the flawed thinking around "Approximate
Exploitability". To truly make informed decisions about exploitability, you
have to enumerate all side-effects, of every bug, in every combination.
</p>

<p>
This makes an exploitability focused triage process much trickier, because now
you need combined bug awareness. The kind of awareness that requires focused
audits to try and find the various pieces to complete the attack puzzle.
</p>

<p>
A more practical approach is probably to evaluate bugs for their viability as
an exploit primitive. Sean Heelan's research[5] in the AEG realm comes to
mind.
</p>

<p>
But even then, it's hard to generalize the problem away from very specific
platform and configuration constraints. You would have to reinvent the same
wheel for almost every platform and software stack out there, each with its
own corpus of exploitability knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us back to the bugonomics of defense vs offense. If I'm an
attacker, I obviously care about exploitability. That's how I get things done.
</p>

<p>
But if I'm a defender, in the developer sense of the word, then I probably
care about general code quality more.
</p>

<p>
Bugs, and bug density, are symptomatic of code quality. The less bugs, the
less potential exploitation primitives … the less potential exploitation
primitives, the less chances of successful exploit chains.
</p>

<p>
Vulnerabilities are just rebranded bugs, after all. Nu pun intended.
</p>

<p>
So, the things we need to do to improve code quality are, by definition, the
same things we need to do reduce vulnerabilities. If that relation holds in
both directions, then perhaps there is more bang for buck in pipeline
strategies that focus on code quality and triage speed as a whole?
</p>

<p>
I do think it's important for developers to understand the ideas behind
exploitation. To have a firm understanding of how input has influence on your
code, and how sometimes that influence can pivot into behavior that benefits
an attacker.
</p>

<p>
But we turned the side-effect into its own thing. Glorified it. Built careers
out of it.
</p>

<p>
So here we are.
</p>

<p>
Knee deep in bugs, trying to convince the world that the ones we understand
the best are the most important ones. Chipping away at them one email
notification at a time … hoping that whoever receives them … agrees.
</p>

<p>
<b>waves hands furiously</b>
</p>

<p>
Love,
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="pointers-that-free-themselves">Pointers that free themselves</h2>

<p>If you are coming from the C world, you have been managing all your resources manually so far.
You allocate each heap memory block using <code>malloc</code> and need to take care of a call to <code>free</code> in every exit path of the function.
As you have probably observed already, this easily leads to human mistakes:
A forgotten <code>free</code> in just one exit path is enough to cause a severe memory leak.
Freeing a pointer twice or using it after a <code>free</code> happens just as easy and can be the source of very painful bugs.</p>

<p>Being a C API, Win32 is no different in this regard.
It offers you <code>HeapAlloc</code> and <code>HeapFree</code>, which are a bit closer to the operating system than their C library counterparts, but otherwise suffer from the same issues.</p>

<p>Now you may argue that YOU obviously never make such mistakes.
So let’s just talk about the code you import from someone else.
If you see a manual memory allocation there, how can you be sure that the programmer correctly handled all exit paths?
There is no way to ensure that unless you check the entire code yourself.</p>

<p>C++ has been trying to be better at memory management since its infancy.
But it has taken until 2011 for C++ to finally come up with a reliable solution that is also going to work tomorrow: <code>std::unique_ptr</code><br>
This template class is a wrapper around any object that you want to put on the heap.
It allocates memory for the wrapped object in its constructor and frees it in its destructor.
As C++ automatically calls the destructor whenever the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope, you can no longer forget that and the human is taken out of the equation.
This makes <code>std::unique_ptr</code> a so-called <em>smart pointer</em>.</p>

<p>If you have been into C++ for quite a while, you may know <code>std::unique_ptr</code>’s predecessor <code>std::auto_ptr</code>.
This one has been deprecated for good (and entirely removed in newer C++ standards) due to its unclear ownership semantics.
The details don’t matter here, just keep in mind that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> fully owns an object and can’t accidentally lose it.
Unlike <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, you can only transfer ownership of that object by using an explicit <code>std::move</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code>std::unique_ptr</code> is only an option for allocating a single object.
It does not work for arrays, because those need to be freed differently (<code>delete[]</code> vs. <code>delete</code>).
While people have often asked for an “auto_array_ptr”, modern C++ offers something even better, which we will dive into in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="universal-c-containers">Universal C++ containers</h2>

<p>For a long time, C <code>char</code> arrays and C++ <code>std::string</code> have been two different worlds.
You could get a constant representation of a <code>char</code> array from an <code>std::string</code> using the <code>c_str</code> method, but a true two-way interaction between both types wasn’t possible.
As a result, legacy C interfaces like the Win32 API often limited you to using traditional C-style arrays without the benefits of modern C++ containers.
You had fun managing all the memory allocations yourself, making sure that nothing leaks, and doing <code>strlen</code> over and over again because a <code>char</code> array doesn’t know its size.</p>

<p>This has changed for good starting with C++11, which guarantees that an <code>std::string</code> is internally stored as a <code>char</code> array.
C++17 adds a <code>data</code> method returning a writable pointer to that <code>char</code> array, finally making <code>std::string</code>s universally usable in all places that use <code>char</code> arrays.</p>

<p>Extensive and error-prone code like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> szTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, NULL, <span>0</span>);

<span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> wszTest <span>=</span> HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, cch <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
<span>if</span> (<span>!</span>wszTest)
{
    printf(<span>"Out of memory!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
}

MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, szTest, <span>-</span><span>1</span>, wszTest, cch);

<span>// Do something with wszTest
</span><span>// Take care to clean it up in all exit paths using:
</span><span></span>
HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), <span>0</span>, wszTest);</code></pre></div>
<p>can finally become as simple as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>string strTest <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>;
<span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), <span>nullptr</span>, <span>0</span>);

std<span>::</span>wstring wstrTest;
wstrTest.resize(cch);
MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, strTest, strTest.size(), wstrTest.data(), cch);

<span>// Do something with wstrTest, cleanup happens automatically
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By the way, the same is also true for <code>std::vector</code>.
All your manual allocations of arrays, prone to buffer overflows and memory leaks, can finally be replaced by automatically managed <code>std::vector</code>s and still interact with APIs written in C.</p>

<h2 id="string-resources-without-regrets">String resources without regrets</h2>

<p>Let’s get deeper into Win32 specifics and use what we just learned.<br>
If you are writing applications for Windows, you have probably made good use of <em>resources</em> already.
Resources allow you to organize strings and graphics at a central location separated from your code.
Each resource is associated with a language code.
When running your application, Windows will pick the resource that best matches your operating system language setting.</p>

<p>For loading a Unicode string resource, the Win32 API of choice is the <code>LoadStringW</code> function.
Even if Microsoft sample code still does, you don’t want to use the ANSI counterpart <code>LoadStringA</code> and neither the <code>LoadString</code> macro that forwards to one of both.
Both were last needed in the era of Windows 95/98/Me, which didn’t come with native Unicode support.
The NT line of Windows has always supported Unicode from the kernel up to the applications.
All <code>A</code> functions there are implemented to convert the string to Unicode and then call the corresponding <code>W</code> function.
As we’re not targeting anything older than Windows XP here, we can (and should!) safely forget about <code>A</code> functions.
Some newer Windows APIs don’t even provide them anymore.</p>

<p>I have seen most people using <code>LoadStringW</code> by declaring a buffer that is “hopefully large enough” and letting the function copy the string into that buffer.
Even Microsoft sample code usually looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">WCHAR wszString[<span>100</span>];
LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, wszString, <span>sizeof</span>(wszString) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(WCHAR));
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code is potentially dangerous in multiple dimensions:<br>
1. If the string for a language later turns out to be longer than 99 characters (consider the terminating NUL), it is silently truncated.
In the best case, this only impacts your user experience badly.
In the worst case, the user loses critical information because the string is later fed to a formatting function like <code>printf</code> and now misses a format character.
2. The developer may forget to divide by the size of a <code>WCHAR</code> in the last parameter, thereby creating the illusion of a larger buffer and laying the foundation for a typical buffer overflow.
3. The return value of <code>LoadStringW</code> isn’t checked at all, hence <code>wszString</code> may be uninitialized.
If you later work with that buffer, expect things to go tremendously wrong.</p>

<p>Only few people know about the other (scarcely documented) way of using <code>LoadStringW</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>const</span> WCHAR<span>*</span> pString;
<span>int</span> CharacterCount <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_STRING_ID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pString), <span>0</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead of copying the resource string into a buffer, this call provides you with a read-only pointer to it.
All resources are already loaded into memory when starting your application, so retrieving the string this way performs no additional copying.
However, there is a caveat here:
The string is not necessarily NUL-terminated when being loaded this way.
This makes it hard to use the string directly in a pure C world where NUL-terminated strings are expected everywhere.
While we also get the character count from this <code>LoadStringW</code> call, we cannot just insert the missing NUL terminator ourselves due to the read-only nature of the string pointer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, C++ comes to the rescue here.
As we have learned that its <code>std::</code> classes are full-fledged alternatives to C-style character arrays these days, we can use them to fix our trouble with <code>LoadStringW</code>.
Enough said, the final function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++">std<span>::</span>wstring LoadStringAsWstr(HINSTANCE hInstance, UINT uID)
{
    PCWSTR pws;
    <span>int</span> cch <span>=</span> LoadStringW(hInstance, uID, <span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span>LPWSTR<span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>pws), <span>0</span>);
    <span>return</span> std<span>::</span>wstring(pws, cch);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>These 3 lines are sufficient to solve all of our problems above.
It doesn’t matter if the string is 10 or 1000 characters long, the function will transparently handle this.
It also doesn’t care about any terminating NUL character, because it just initializes a new <code>std::wstring</code> and copies the retrieved number of characters from the read-only resource pointer.
The returned <code>std::wstring</code> is guaranteed to be initialized and a comfortable and safe way to work with the loaded string.</p>

<p>I’m also using Hungarian notation in my final function to emphasize a few things.
The <code>pws</code> abbreviation refers to a <em>pointer to a wide-string</em>.
You may have more commonly seen <code>pwsz</code>, which would translate to a <em>pointer to a wide-string terminated by zero</em>.
As we just discussed, the latter part does not apply here, and this is underlined by the subtle difference in naming.
Similarly, <code>cch</code> stands for <em>count of characters</em> and distinguishes the integer variable from a count of bytes (<code>cb</code>).
You will deal with both when using Win32 API, and proper naming helps to not mess things up.</p>

<h2 id="mastering-the-handle-mess">Mastering the handle mess</h2>

<p>If you write your Win32 application in C, you soon have handles all over the place.
Every I/O operation, network connection or registry key, just to name a few, is identified by a handle variable that you must take care of.
When a resource is no longer needed, you need to close the handle manually - and again you must do so for all exit paths of your function.
This technique is susceptible to the same human mistakes that we …</p></div></div></div>

<p name="db86">I watched “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" data-href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a>”, the documentary by the Center for Humane Technology and featuring Tristan Harris, yesterday. It taught me zero new things. I learned nothing that I had not already come across during my research for my latest book <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Life Beyond the Touch Screen</a>. Or that I had not even incorporated in the book.</p>
<p name="b017">I was, however, very much inspired by the documentary.</p>
<p name="b017"><em><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaaC57tcci0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></em></p>
<p name="b017"><em>[Oh wait, I did learn two new things. I learned about </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>the role Facebook played</em></a><em> and admitted it played in the Myanmar Rohingya Muslim violence. And that there is such a thing as </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/23/faking-it-how-selfie-dysmorphia-is-driving-people-to-seek-surgery" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/23/faking-it-how-selfie-dysmorphia-is-driving-people-to-seek-surgery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Snapchat Dismorphia</em></a><em> — a.k.a. kids seeking surgery to look more like their filtered selfies in real life. ‘Da hell.]</em></p>
<p name="b017"><em>[Note: Tristan Harris, together with Nir Eyal and Yuval Noah Harari, has been one of my greatest inspirations for creating "Life Beyond the Touch Screen". Nothing but respect. Read on to understand more.]</em></p>
<p name="a2d9">I was inspired because I recognized two things. One being the difficulty Tristan Harris — legendary former design ethicist at Google — and other former and current high-ranking executives from silicon valley, venture capitalists and academics were having;</p>
<blockquote name="fe84"><em>In trying to explain what was so wrong and so dangerous about the role digital technology is taking in our lives today.</em></blockquote>
<p name="b0e2">What is that problem?</p>
<p name="13db">This was the second thing I recognized. The problem is that next to and simultaneous to adding so much ease and benefit to our lives, digital technology and mainly social media, are impacting our individual mental health, the mental health of our children, and the fabric of society and democracy in very, very dark ways as well.</p>
<p name="b43a">We are getting burn-out by the masses, staggeringly high rates of depression, anxiety and suicide in teens (mostly girls), and unprecedented levels of political polarization and tampering of election results with the help of an explosion of fake news. Propaganda, and real-life, deadly violence.</p>
<p name="5883">Why? Because armies of already genius experts in the psychology of persuasion and addiction, armed with the most powerful technology mankind has ever seen, are becoming more and more proficient at altering our behavior in minuscule but very, very real ways.</p>
<blockquote name="42dd">I am seriously afraid for our mental health, for that of our children, and for the world they will inherit.</blockquote>
<p name="d360">The problem underneath that being that the supercomputers and algorithms working to do that, are programmed from a capitalist and commercial perspective — so their highest goal is not humanity’s greater good: instead it is the highest possible profit.</p>
<p name="81e5">Our attention, time, and energy are being sold to the highest bidder. And as I have written before; maybe it’s <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" data-href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-state-of-ai-in-the-world-56be75b51887" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a question of when A.I. starts taking over from us humans</a> — but rather a question of when we will wake up to the fact that it already has.</p>
<h3 name="f1ee">“The Social Dilemma”- Review, Summary, ArtfulGraphic</h3>
</div>
<div>
<figure name="13ff"><img data-image-id="1*Zhq2MjvT7v_k5hT3TTDkeA.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1800/1*Zhq2MjvT7v_k5hT3TTDkeA.jpeg"></figure>
</div>
<div>
<p name="e837">I was so inspired by “The Social Dilemma” that I created the above ArtfulGraphic, to try and help create momentum — in all honesty, also to possibly ride the hype I’m hopefully helping to create, and promote <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" data-href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction?ref=hackernoon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my book</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="1241">I drew a lady with a <em>black mirror</em> face, edited the picture in a wonderful app called Photofox, and then created the Graphic in PowerPoint — I’m no pro designer, sorry, not sorry.</p>
<p name="e1a1">Mainly, though, I created the above ArtfulGraphic to try to explain as simply as possible what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="0971">Why this stuff matters and why you want to get inspired and take action now. And why you should watch “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" data-href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Social Dilemma</a>” on Netflix today, preferably together with your spouse and your kids, if you have them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2 days ago I subscribed to GitHub sponsors to fund my work on the <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">GraphQL API for WordPress</a>, and I already got <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/leoloso/">my first sponsor</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsors.png" alt="GitHub sponsors" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1510"><figcaption>GitHub sponsors</figcaption></figure><p>Following the example set by Caleb Porzio (who's making <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">more than u$d 100k/y doing open source</a>), I have decided to use the <a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware">sponsorware model</a> to fund my project. It works like this:</p><ul><li>Whenever I get 10 new sponsors (at u$d 14/m), I start developing the most up-voted feature from a special <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp/projects/2">"Sponsorware" list</a> (which I'm completing as I'm writing this milestone)</li><li>Once implemented, the new feature becomes available to all the sponsors, via a private GitHub repo</li><li>As soon as I get 50 new sponsors, the new feature becomes open source, accessible to everyone via the public GitHub repo, and is integrated into the plugin</li></ul><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/sponsorware-features.png" alt="Sponsorware features" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1120"><figcaption>Sponsorware features</figcaption></figure><p>In a few months, I will also start creating instructional videos, explaining how to make the most out of the plugin. According to Caleb, this is the biggest money-making strategy.</p><p>I have also decided to add a middle tier (at u$d 70/m), where I provide Slack-based personal support, to help users of my plugin set-up GraphQL with WordPress, troubleshooting, and answering their questions. A user needed help to develop a functionality, so he decided to sponsor me &lt;= my first sponsor ❤️</p><p>Finally, I added a higher tier (at u$d 700) for corporate sponsors. I plan to ask around in the WordPress community if their companies may be interested in participating. That would be a win-win: They get plenty of face from contributing to open source, and I get the certainty that I can make a living wage from my work and can focus on the development of the plugin (and not on marketing, which is not my forte).</p><figure><img src="https://leoloso.com/images/leoloso-github-sponsor-projects.png" alt="My sponsors and sponsored projects" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1210"><figcaption>My sponsors and sponsored projects</figcaption></figure><p>I hope the sponsorware model works, and I can make a living while working on open source. I'll keep writing updates on how it goes, here on my blog, and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/leoloso">on IndieHackers</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

For example, if the user is sending the <em>address of their website</em> along with the form, you use it to distinguish between the received forms</li><li><strong>event value</strong> - (<em>optional</em>) to add a numeric value to the information.

In my example, it is a <strong>button</strong>, but it could also be an<!-- --> <strong>image</strong> or a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, or any other HTML tag - so the question is: How do we tell Google Tag Manager (GTM) which element to observe?<br>The Answer is: <strong>CSS selectors</strong> - You don’t know what that is? It is just a programmatic way of specifying HTML elements on the page and I will show you a way to get the CSS selector for any element with just a few mouse clicks.</li><li>In Google's Chrome browser, <strong>right-click</strong> any element you would like to track clicks on and select <strong>inspect</strong>. Chrome Developer Tools will open up and by default, the HTML element will be pre-selected.</li><li>Then you simply <strong>right-click</strong> the element and choose <strong>Copy</strong> &gt;<!-- --> <strong>Copy JS path</strong> (avoid <em>copy selector</em> - it returns faulty selectors from time to time).</li></ul><ul><li>If you paste the content of your clipboard into a text editor, you will see you copied something like:<p><code>document.querySelector("body &gt; ul &gt; button")</code></p><p>We want to take the part that is inside the brackets, without the “”. So, this part:</p><p><code>body &gt; ul &gt; button</code></p></li><li><strong>This is the CSS Selector</strong> we need to paste into the last field in our trigger configuration in GTM (<em>see below</em>).<br><strong>Copy</strong> that value and paste it in. Click <strong>save</strong>.</li></ul><p>Notice you could do this with any element and set up any event trigger in GTM as you like?</p><p>We are not done yet.

You can think of triggers and tags as the <em>when</em> and <em>what</em> in our example: <br> The trigger defines <em>when</em> we want to track an event (<em>when our button is clicked</em>), and now we will define a GA event, that describes<!-- --> <em>what</em> we do: <em>Send an event to GA including all the right values for the event properties.</em></p><p>Let’s get started.</p><ul><li>In Google Tag Manager go to the tags menu and <em>create a new tag</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>Give the tag a <strong>name</strong> like <em>Button Event</em> and click on<!-- --> <strong>tag configuration</strong>.</li><li>A panel from the right side is going to slide in with a list of possible tag types to choose from.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Cyber-crimes affect companies from all industries like IT, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Finance. Healthcare is one of the most targeted since this sector relies on the perpetual exchange of big volumes of valuable data.</p>
<div><p>Amid a health crisis, a cyberattack targeting healthcare IT systems around the world takes place every three days <a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p><p>Since the beginning of the second decade of this millennium, cyber threats and data breaches increase rate has <a href="https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/article/22026828/cyberattacks-skyrocketed-in-2018-are-you-ready-for-2019" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spiked disturbingly</a>. Cyber regulations are evolving and requiring healthcare facilities to address more than just the patient’s illnesses. Also responsible for the security of their data, they make health care information security a priority. And they are pushed to do it. Any intrusion on the integrity of internal data can have catastrophic consequences for patients and healthcare facilities.</p></div>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/healthcare-breach-barometer-2016-2019.jpg" alt="Healthcare Data Breaches 2016-2019">
<figcaption><small>Healthcare Data Breaches 2016-2019</small></figcaption>
</figure>
<div><p>For healthcare companies, a breach of security is very costly. In this critical context, the health sector must be aware and ready to do everything possible to secure their health applications and data banks, by channeling enough technological and financial resources to them. The data collected in the health sector is particularly sensitive because most records become a significant liability when compromised. Healthcare organizations are prime targets for cybercriminals seeking to gain valuable information by exploiting vulnerable security systems. The risk of a breach is reduced by adopting security measures with mighty authentication methods, paired with employee training – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-fortinet/2019/08/27/the-importance-of-training-cybersecurity-awareness-as-a-firewall/#2693a2cd8b4b%20target=" _blank"="" rel="nofollow">a necessary follow-up action</a> that some companies tend to undermine, and, therefore, risk turning into a headline in cybersecurity news sites.</p><p>One specific area of healthcare is particularly susceptible to cyberattacks, and criminals often use it to create a breakpoint - the company’s supply chain. Because health organizations rely on multiple suppliers and external services, they support a vast network where massive data is on a constant exchange. Securing such an intense pipeline of information flow is exceptionally difficult, and hackers won’t hesitate to abuse this unfortunate fact.</p><p>In the Healthcare sector, computer systems contain sensitive data and support organizations in the delivery of quality patient services, making them a prime target for extortion attempts. Phishing, in which a cybercriminal poses as a legitimate organization or individual to entice trust, is a common form of attack. Emails have always been a possible point of entry, filled with bogus attachments and links to fake websites. Email breach is of particular concern in healthcare, as staff consistently uses emails to exchange highly valuable data. If an employee’s email login information is stolen or disclosed - including their username and password - they can be used by criminals to gain access to patient records, and based on this employee level of access, possibly leverage even further damage.</p></div>
<h2>Applications at the service of health: pay attention to the data!</h2>
<div><p>The concept of e-health is not technologically innovative. The service itself is not advanced by any means; what is innovative is the main piece of technology it uses. This tech choice consists of the provision of communicating applications allowing, here, to perform specific measures via the combined effort of a peripheral, a service platform (mainly based on cloud technologies) and a communication network <a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p><p>The security principles and techniques applicable to e-health are, therefore, very similar to those considered by suppliers of critical connected systems. The main difference is that medical devices process health data, which is among the most lucrative for cybercriminals. Personal medical records reside under the aegis of restrictive regulations. Such regulations impose special protection to guarantee the integrity of the patient’s privacy.</p><p>New black gold, all the corporate data collected and processed, defines the level of risk for the services that use this information. In the case of e-health, all present vulnerabilities and medical data leak possibilities must be eradicated. Data protection can break the integrity of private data. For example, sensitive information can circulate multiple communication channels and get exposed to a breach. Not even the doctor-patient is entirely bulletproof.</p><p>A data communication channel may temporarily break data integrity. For example, doctor-patient communication is vulnerable to data leaks, despite the security-laden non-disclosure agreement they both approve.</p><p>Of course, sensitive data can be partially <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/benefits-of-encryption-technology-for-data-protection">encrypted</a></b> or partially exposed. For example, to explain conditions or medical treatment procedures, doctors use <i>pseudonymization</i>, when communication with their patients. Doctors also use <i>anonymization</i>, when it comes to data as part of statistics or a plan to improve a specific service.</p></div>
<h2>Cybersecurity in the Healthcare sector:</h2>
<p>Healthcare organizations should ensure that they have robust security measures in place to limit the risks of email account compromise <a href="#ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, cyber security threat breaches, and other cyber security threat related incidents. These measures must cover all parameters inherent to <i>people, processes, and technologies</i>:
</p><ul><li><b>Practices and procedures</b> – Strong authentication methods, secure access to applications, systems, and data; Communication with staff and other key stakeholders’ regular updates, as well as reminders of safety behaviors and mandatory actions during safety failure;</li>
<li><b>Supplier Relationships</b> – Cybercriminals can exploit any weak link in a supply chain to gain access to a target. “The existence of strong links between companies within a healthcare ecosystem can compromise an entire ecosystem.” This is why, our latest Healthcare app project, MeTime, features a ‘close-quarters’ environment where vendors, clients and suppliers can safely exchange data while preserving privacy integrity.</li>
<li><b>Log management</b> – Healthcare facilities often use a set of proprietary applications and systems that must be linked together within an IT security framework. LogPoint’s highly flexible cybersecurity software architecture addresses this problem and has become the standard cybersecurity tool for log management in the healthcare industry <a href="#ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Some of the world’s most advanced hospitals are using our next-generation SIEM solution to protect their patient information.</li>
<li><b>Training</b> – Entry-to-service training, regular reminders, additional training for all staff, and, where appropriate, other stakeholders. Malicious activity isn’t the only activity impacting your organization. Human error - as is the case in any industry - is another risk that deserves attention. Incorrect distribution of information and inappropriate handling of sensitive data puts your organization at high risk for data loss.</li>
<li><b>Ransomware</b> – ransomware is another type of direct cybersecurity threat to the healthcare industry. While this type of attack typically cannot confirm a breach, ransomware has the potential to directly affect the privacy, integrity, and availability of critical systems. It is essential to prepare for the possibility of such an incident and harden your security policies accordingly. The recent spikes in ransomware attacks suggest it is a matter of time when online attackers will cycle toward any possible company. The best move is to expect a blow from that angle and get prepared on that front.</li></ul>
<h2>The potential role of AI for health application security</h2>
<div><p>It is no longer a secret: ensuring the security of information systems is one of the significant challenges in companies. The fight against cybercrime has experienced a small revolution in recent years, thanks to the application of artificial intelligence. Through machine learning, we can discover how threats operate and evolve and use that information for a more precise counter-measure.</p><p>The number one difficulty in cybersecurity is the realization that criminals are always one step ahead of companies: they look for security holes, that someone working for the company is likely to overlook. Also, there is the exponential and ultra-rapid development of <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/new-tech-in-ecommerce">new technologies</a></b>, particularly cloud and mobile. Hackers are quick to learn how new tech can be used to their advantage, and cybersecurity experts must keep up, keeping up with their, looking to predict, and dismantle their attempts.</p><p>Most basic security solutions focus on understanding malware and preventing infiltration. Thus, rather than being in action, they will instead react to present and incoming danger. This passive threat-response strategy requires regular updates, among other things, and their use alone proves to be insufficient. A more sophisticated cyber solution finds an ally in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machines have the intensity and relentlessness needed when battling cyber threats and are preferred tools of veteran cybersecurity experts.</p><p>AI can proactively identify and mitigate a threat even before a patch is developed and released <a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Its main advantage is its ability to relieve the human factor of tedious and time-consuming tasks, and this with a better reaction capacity in the treatment of alerts that flood computer systems daily.</p><p>AI then makes it possible to spot, analyze, and respond to cyber-attacks faster than a human. It provides an instrument which, when applied to cybersecurity, improves the efficiency and strengthens the protection of information technologies, for companies constrained by time and resources, financial or human.</p><p>It is on the processing of data between applications that AI can have a considerable impact. Robotics quickly analyzes a large amount of data from which it can spot anomalies or signal potential threats. Machines learn from a growing set of data and, over time, become more and more precise at detecting abnormalities. Today, Machine Learning finally gains the power to support human expertise in decision-making.</p><p>The future of cybersecurity is about embracing and innovating to …</p></div></div></div>

<p>AWS Glue is a fully managed serverless ETL service. It is used for ETL purposes and perhaps most importantly used in data lake eco systems. Its high level capabilities can be found in one of &nbsp;my previous post <a href="https://lijjumathew.com/etl-options-in-aws/">here</a>, but in this post I want to detail Glue Catalog, Glue Jobs and an example to illustrate a simple job.</p><h3 id="glue-catalog">Glue Catalog</h3><ul>
<li>Glue catalog is a metadata repository built automatically by crawling the datasets by Glue Crawlers. It contains tables with in a database created by crawlers and these tables can be queried via AWS Athena. Crawlers can crawl S3, RDS, Dynamo DB, Redshift and any on-prem databases that can connect via JDBC. These crawled datasets can further be used as a source or target connection in Glue while developing jobs.</li>
<li>The way crawlers work is, it has built in classifiers and runs these classifiers against the dataset in an orderly fashion. If the classifier cant recognize the data, the crawler invokes the next classifier. We can also build custom classifier and use that. These crawlers can be scheduled to scan at a regular period of time and there is an option to update the schema of the data catalog tables or ignore updates.</li>
<li>Here are some of bad experiences with crawlers that I had which you have to be careful about. One, crawling a dataset in s3 which has millions of small s3 files will take time and can be costly affair. Two, make sure data is organized in partitions and the data set that is crawled has similar files in folder. If that is not the case, say if it has 100 files of different schema, crawler can end up creating 100 tables.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glue-jobs">Glue Jobs</h3><ul>
<li>Glue provides two shells, python shell and spark shell to execute a piece of code. Python shell can be used to can execute plain python code and it is a non distributed environment. The Spark Shell is a distributed environment to execute spark code written in either PySpark or Scala.</li>
<li>While using Spark shell, in addition to data frames and other constructs that spark has, Glue has a new construct called dynamic frames which requires no schema unlike data frame. Dynamic frames has few transformation functions and we can always convert dynamic frame to data frame and vice versa to use each other transformation functions.</li>
<li>Glue dev end point provides an environment to author the jobs and test it. It is an EMR cluster with all glue utilities.</li>
<li>Here are some of the important configuration parameters for Glue jobs.
<ul>
<li>Bookmark is a feature to track data that has already processed by the job in previous runs by persisting the state information. For example if we have a Glue that reads from S3 and the data is partitioned, it reads only new partition data if bookmark option is enabled(disabled by default). This feature can be used for relational sources and it keeps track of the new data by keys defined for the table.</li>
<li>DPU(Data Processing Unit) is the term used to denote the processing power allocated to the glue job. A single DPU is 4 vCpu and 16 GB of memory. Spark job requires minimum of 2 DPUs. Worker type tells what type of nodes. There is standard, G1.X(for memory intensive) and G.2X( for ML Transforms).</li>
<li>Delay notification threshold time can be set to notify (cloud watch) jobs running above the threshold time.</li>
<li>Run time parameters can be passed to job as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Features
<ul>
<li>Metrics - Glue provides spark web ui to monitor and debug the jobs. Job logs can be viewed in cloudwatch.</li>
<li>It also supports streaming ETL where we can set up continuous ingestion pipelines from sources like Kinesis, Kafka and ingest into S3 or other data stores.</li>
<li>It has a feature called workflow to orchestrate the crawlers and jobs with dependencies and triggers.</li>
<li>It also provides an interface to create and work with Sagemaker and Zepplin notebooks.</li>
<li>User defined custom python packages/modules can be used in both the shells by having it zipped and stored in S3.</li>
<li>There is a warm up time involved when you run a Glue job and it use to be around 10 mins. With Glue 2.0 it is brought down to 1 min.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pricing - You are billed only for the time the ETL job takes to run and no upfront cost for startup or shutdown time. It is charged based on number of DPU's used for the job and it is $0.44 per DPU-hour. Glue version 2.0 have a 1-minute billing duration and older versions have a 10-minute minimum billing duration. Data catalog and crawler runs have additional charges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glue-example">Glue Example</h3><p>Here is an example of Glue PySpark Job which reads from S3, filters data and writes to Dynamo Db. The job can be created from console or done normally using infrastructure as service tools like AWS cloudformation, Terraform etc. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/lijjumathew/AWS_Examples/blob/master/Glue/s3_to_dynamodb_load.py">here</a>. </p>

<p>Spyware written for educational institutions to flex their muscles of control over students and their families when learning from their home computer is still, categorically, spyware.</p>



<p>Depending on your persuasion, the previous sentence sounds like either needless pedantry, or it reads like tautology. But we need to be clear on our terms.</p>



<ol><li>Educational spyware is still spyware.</li><li>Spyware is categorized as a subset of malware.</li></ol>



<p>When vulnerabilities are discovered in malware, the normal rules of <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">coordinated disclosure</a> are out of scope. Are we clear?</p>







<p>So let’s talk about Proctorio!</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For anyone unfamiliar with it, Proctorio is a browser extension used to eliminate cheating through intense surveillance techniques. It records the computer screen while you take the exam to ensure you don’t look anything up. However, it’s more than that. (Thread 1/11)</p>— Cassie (@Angry_Cassie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Angry_Cassie/status/1301360994044850182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>The entire thread is unrolled <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1301360994044850182.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I won’t go into the details of Proctorio or why it’s terrible for (especially disadvantaged) students. Read Cassie’s Twitter thread for more context on that. Seriously. I’m not gonna be one of those guys that <em>talks over</em> women, and neither should you.</p>



<p>What I am here to talk about today is these dubious claim about the security of their product:</p>







<h2 id="zero-knowledge">Zero-Knowledge Encryption? OMGWTFBBQ!</h2>



<p>In cryptography, there are a class of algorithms called Zero-Knowledge Proofs. In a Zero-Knowledge Proof, you prove that you possess some fact without revealing any details <em>about</em> the fact.</p>



<p>It’s kind of abstract to think about (and until we’re ready to talk about Pedersen commitments, I’m just going to defer to <a href="https://openprivacy.ca/work/swisspost-scytl-evoting/">Sarah Jamie Lewis</a>), but the only thing you need to know about “Zero Knowledge” in Cryptography is that the output is a boolean (True, False).</p>



<p>You can’t use “Zero Knowledge” <em>anything</em> to encrypt. So “Zero-Knowledge Encryption” is a meaningless buzzword.</p>

<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a cryptographer, I would like details on how on Earth it is using zero knowledge proofs in this situation.

<p>So what are they actually describing when they say Zero Knowledge Encryption?</p>







<p>Okay, so they’ve built their own key distribution system and are encrypting with AES-GCM… and shipped this in a Chrome extension. But before we get to that, look at this <strong>Daily Vulnerability Tests</strong> claim.</p>

<p>Running Nessus (or equivalent) on a cron job isn’t meaningful metric of security. At best, it creates alert fatigue when you accidentally screw up a deployment configuration or forget to update your software for 4+ years. (Y’know, like JsZip 3.2.1, which they bundle.)</p>



<p>A dumb vulnerability scan isn’t the same thing as a routine (usually quarterly) penetration test or a code audit. And if you’re working in cryptography, <em>you better have both</em>!</p>



<h2 id="vulnerability">Timing Leaks in Proctorio’s AES-GCM Implementation</h2>



<p>If you download version 1.4.20241.1.0 of the Proctorio Chrome Extension, run <code>src/assets/J5HG.js</code> through a JS beautifier, and then look at its contents, you will quickly realize this is a JavaScript cryptography library.</p>



<p>Since the “zero knowledge” encryption they’re so proud about uses AES-GCM, let’s focus on that.</p>



<p>Proctorio’s AES-GCM implementation exists in an object called <code>dhs.mode.gcm</code>, which is mildly obfuscated, but contains the following functions:</p>



<ul><li><code>encrypt()</code> – Encrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>decrypt()</code> – Decrypt with AES-GCM</li><li><code>aa()</code> – GHASH block multiplication</li><li><code>j()</code> – XOR + GMAC utility function</li><li><code>O()</code> – Called by encrypt() and decrypt(); does all of the AES-CTR + GMAC fun</li></ul>



<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a>, just know this: <a href="https://cryptologie.net/article/361/breaking-https-aes-gcm-or-a-part-of-it/">Timing leaks</a> can be used to leak your GMAC key to outside applications, which completely breaks the authentication of AES-GCM and opens the door to chosen-ciphertext attacks.</p>



<p>So is their implementation of AES-GCM constant-time? Let’s take a look at <code>aa()</code>:</p>


<pre title="">aa: function(a, b) {
  var c, d, e, f, g, h = dhs.bitArray.ba;
  for (e = [0, 0, 0, 0], f = b.slice(0), c = 0; 128 &gt; c; c++) {
    for (
      (d = 0 !== (a[Math.floor(c / 32)] &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; 31 - c % 32)) &amp;&amp; (e = h(e, f)),
        g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3]),
        d = 3;
      d &gt; 0;
      d--
    )
      f[d] = f[d] &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 | (1 &amp; f[d - 1]) &lt;&lt; 31;
    f[0] &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1,
    g &amp;&amp; (f[0] ^= -520093696)
  }
  return e
},
</pre>


<p>This is a bit obtuse, but this line leaks the lowest bit of <code>f</code> with each iteration: <code>g = 0 !== (1 &amp; f[3])</code>.</p>



<p>Since <code>f</code> gets bitwise right-shifted 128 times, this actually leaks the bit of every value of <code>f</code> in each block multiplication, since the execution of <code>(f[0] ^= -520093696)</code> depends on whether or not <code>g</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Also, they claim to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, but this is how they generate randomness in their cryptography library.</p>

<p>(Although, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search?SearchMode=Basic&amp;Vendor=Proctorio&amp;CertificateStatus=Active&amp;ValidationYear=0">that’s probably a lie</a>.)</p>

<p>(Also, use WebCrypto to generate entropy! What the fuck.)</p>



<h2>If Proctorio is Insecure, What Should We Use Instead?</h2>



<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>



<p>Schools that demand students install spyware on their personal computers are only a step removed from domestic abusers who install stalkerware on their victims’ phones.</p>



<p>Proctorio isn’t the problem here, they’re only a symptom.</p>



<p>Schools that insist on violating the integrity and parental dominion of their students’ home computers are the problem here.</p>

<p>This project belongs to a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics">computer graphics</a> artist and researcher, Karl Sims, who is best known for using <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_systems">particle systems</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_life">artificial life</a> in computer animation.</p>
<p>A harmonograph is a mechanical device that uses swinging pendulums to draw pictures, believed to be initially invented in 1844 by Scottish mathematician&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Blackburn" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh Blackburn.</a>&nbsp;This 3-pendulum rotary type of harmonograph gives a wide variety of satisfying results. It is reasonably easy to build once you’ve settled on a design and have acquired the appropriate materials and tools. Harmonograph is a great project to do with kids and can result in endless experiments creating new geometric designs.</p>

<h2>STEP 1</h2>
<p><strong>Table.</strong> Start by building a sturdy table. This table-top is a 3’x3′ square of 3/4″ thick plywood. The legs are 1½” x 1½” square and about 37″ long, with triangular braces cut from 1½” x 8″x 12″ wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength and allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.</p>
<div><p><strong>Tip:</strong> screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw. Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37″.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> if you want to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.</p></div>

<figcaption><strong>Holes for Pendulums</strong>. Drill 3 holes of 3″ diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The rotary pendulum’s hole should be centered in a corner about 8″ from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8″ from the common side, and 3″ from the other. You’ll need a particular sizeable circular drill bit for this. Alternatively, you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Plates to support pendulums</strong>. Mount two metal plates (about 1¼” x 4″) on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes and drill a small indentation in each plate’s center. <p><strong>Tip:</strong> first, start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8″) and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4″). Be careful not to drill all the way through. Tip: unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Pendulums.</strong> The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½” outer and 1″ inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.<p>Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the picture from below, note the oak blocks (3/4″ x 1½” x 5″) supporting the two screws (1¾” #10) protruding upwards and diagonally. File down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed, so the pendulum doesn’t hit them when it swings. Likewise, file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn’t hit the table when swinging.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Weights.</strong> 2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1″ interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4″ pendulum dowel by using a 5″ long 3/4″ metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4″ to 1″ bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1″ steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off and allows easy adjustment of the weight’s height to give different swinging frequencies.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Paper Platform. </strong>Cut about 1″ off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11″x11″ square of thin 1/8″ board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4″ hole for the dowel. Wrap some tape around the dowel’s top to get a tight fit, or glue it on.<p>*** Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform. If the form slips on the platform, spray a thin layer of temporary adhesive on the platform to make it slightly sticky.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><strong>Arms.</strong> Connect a 30″ long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.<p>To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2″ hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4″ down the arm’s center to make a clothes-pin like a device. Alternatively, glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.</p><p>Finally, attach the two arms with a doubled-over rubber band, as shown.</p><p>Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won’t wear as quickly might be necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;An alternate version of the arm-pendulum connection is shown to the right that uses a magnetic ball joint instead of the simple nail method above. Glue one 3/8″ spherical magnet to the arm (making sure the N/S alignment is horizontal by connecting a second magnet). File a hole in the side of a nylon cylinder (1″ height, 1/2″ outer and 3/8″ inner diameter) and use smaller cylinders (3/8″ outer diameter) to hold another magnet inside that can rotate freely. Then glue the cylinder to the top of the pendulum.</p></figcaption></figure>

To do this, insert a 30″ pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won’t be hit by it (about 12″ from the rotary pendulum hole). Attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support. Tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Step 10</h2>
<p><strong>Pens.</strong> Experiment with pens and markers of various types and colors. Generally, wide pens or thin markers seem to work best. Here are some I’ve had good luck with so far:</p>
<ul><li>Uniball GEL Impact in Silver, use on black or dark paper.</li><li>Staedtler Triplus Rollerball Pens (.4mm) in various colors</li><li>Pigma Graphic 1 (1.0mm) in black</li><li>Sakura Identi Pen in black, purple, etc.</li></ul>
<p>but many other types of pens may also work well.</p>
<h2>Adjustments</h2>
<p><strong>Weight Height</strong>. Adjust a pendulum’s weight height to change its swinging frequency. The frequency of a pendulum varies with the inverse of the square root of its length, so to swing twice as fast, the length between the fulcrum and its center-of-mass would need to be 1/4 of the original length (which may not be practical with this harmonograph). For a 3:2 or 4:3 frequency increase, the weights would be raised around 19″ or 15″ respectively, although you should probably do some timing tests to find and mark these heights experimentally.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Amount</strong>. Add more weight to a pendulum to counteract friction and make the swinging last longer. I’ve found that 5 lb (2 x 2½) on the rotary pendulum, and 7½ lb (3 x 2½) on the other two works reasonably well. Note that adding more weight does not generally change the frequency of the pendulum.</p>
<p><strong>Phase and Amplitude</strong>. Each time you swing the pendulums to make a new drawing, each pendulum’s relative phases, and amplitudes will vary. Try somewhere the rotary pendulum, and the lateral pendulums are initially making circles in the same or opposite directions. Try somewhere the lateral pendulums are initially swinging in phase to make a diagonal line.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>Two-pendulum results</strong>. To simplify things, you can lock …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most people might not understand it’s power, and some might not know how to use it. A strong knowledge of <a href="https://archive.org/">WBM</a> is probably more important now than it ever was.</p>

<p>The WayBackMachine basically gives you the ability to travel back in time on the internet.</p>
<p>It also allows you to freeze a moment of time on the internet.</p>
<p>Like any genuine time machine, it can be challenging to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be slow at times.</li>
<li>It can be slow at times.</li>
<li>Recalled moments in time can be missing elements such as pictures or video.</li>
<li>It might not be obvious how to control the time circuits (advanced features should be learned to properly filter search results).</li>

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/">WBM</a> does not apologize. It doesn’t sensor what you find. If you take the time machine to a place where something bad happened, you must be prepared to see what happened.</p>
<p>In an experiment to see how far back in time I could travel in Hawaii news, I saw an elephant go rogue and stampede people (1994). I’ve seen many high-casualty-action-movies, but this sad to witness because I knew it was real.</p>

<p>There are many important events that were either preceded by – or the result of – things happening on the internet.</p>
<p>Knowing this, as well as the web-presence of the people involved in such events, with a little skilled WBM use you can bring to the surface that which had previously sunk into the depths of internet history.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a professional investigator to get to the bottom of what happened, whether the events be minor or catastrophic. You just have to know how to search the internet.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-truth-promoter">as a truth-promoter…</h3>
<p>In the pre-internet days, history was written by the winners.</p>
<p>These days, however, history is recorded in real time. Its hard to rewrite events under the passive and accidental surveillance system that the internet is.</p>
<p>Events that happened in recent decades will often have an internet counterpart that can be studied.</p>
<p>With some clever WBM piloting, you can use the power of truth to dethrone that which had previously prospered in a lie.</p>
<p>So for those who are involved in current issues that were effected by the recent past, WBM cannot be overlooked.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's something I have to get off my chest. If you really need to, just read the TLDR and listen to the Justin Bieber parody posted below. If you’re confused by the lingo, the rest of the post will fill in any gaps.</p><div><p>TL;DR: Benchmarketing, the practice of using benchmarks for marketing, is bad. Consumers should run their own benchmarks and ideally open-source them instead of relying on an internal and biased report.</p><p>Enjoy the song I wrote about this silly practice.</p></div><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSy8V-R0_Zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>For the longest time, I have wondered what is the point of corporations, specifically in the database sectors, running their own benchmarks. Would a company ever have any incentive to post results from a benchmark that didn't show its own system winning in at least the majority of cases? I understand that these benchmarks have become part of the furniture we come to expect to see when visiting any hot new database's website. I doubt anybody in the public domain gains much insight out of these results, to begin with, at least nothing they weren't expecting to see. </p><p>Now to be clear, I am in no way indicating that companies running their own internal benchmarks to analyze their own performance in comparison to their competitors is a bad thing. It’s when they take those results and intentionally skew the methods or data from these benchmarks for sales or marketing purposes that is the problem we’re discussing here. Vendors that take part in the practice, not only use these benchmarks to show their systems succeeding a little but rather perversely taint their methodology with settings, caching, and other performance enhancements, while leaving their competition’s settings untouched. </p><p>This should be obvious that this is NOT what benchmarking is about! If you read about the history of the <a href="http://www.tpc.org/information/about/history5.asp">Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC)</a> you come to understand that this is the very wrongdoing that the council was created to address. But like with any proxy involving measurements, the measurements are inherently pliable.</p><blockquote>By the spring of 1991, the TPC was clearly a success. Dozens of companies were running multiple TPC-A and TPC-B results. Not surprisingly, these companies wanted to capitalize on the TPC's cachet and leverage the investment they had made in TPC benchmarking. Several companies launched aggressive advertising and public relations campaigns based around their TPC results. In many ways, this was exactly why the TPC was created: to provide objective measures of performance. What was wrong, therefore, with companies wanting to brag about their good results? What was wrong is that there was often a large gap between the objective benchmark results and their benchmark marketing claims--this gap, over the years, has been dubbed "benchmarketing." So the TPC was faced with an ironic situation. It had poured an enormous amount of time and energy into creating a good benchmark and even a good benchmark review process. However, the TPC had no means to control how those results were used once they were approved. The resulting problems generated intense debates within the TPC.</blockquote><p>This benchmarketing ultimately fails the clients that these companies are marketing to. It demonstrates not only a lack of care for addressing the users' actual pain but a lack of respect by intentionally pulling the wool over their eyes simply in an attempt to mask that their performance isn't up to par with their competitors. <strong>This leads to consumers not being able to make informed decisions as most of our decisions are made from gut instincts and human emotion which these benchmarks aim to manipulate.</strong></p><p>If you’re not sure exactly how a company would pull this off, an example of might be that database A enables using a cost-based optimizer that requires precomputing statistics about different tables involved in the computation, while database B is running a query against this table without any type of stats based optimization made available to it. Database A will clearly dominate as now it can reorder joins and apply better execution plans while database B is going to go with the simplest plan and run much slower in most scenarios. The company whose product depends on database A will then hone in on the numerical outcomes of this report. Even if they're decent enough to report the methods they skewed to get these results, they bury it within their report and focus on advertising the outcome of what would otherwise be considered an absurd comparison. Companies will even go as far as to say that their competition's database wasn't straight forward to configure when they were setting up optimizations. If you're not capable of understanding how to make equivalent changes to both systems, well then I guess you don't get to run that comparison until you figure it out. &nbsp;</p><p>Many think that consumers are not susceptible to such attacks and would be able to see right through this scheme, but these reports appeal to any of us when we don't have the necessity or resources to thoroughly examine all the data. Many times we have to take cues from our gut when a decision needs to be made and the time to make it is constrained by our time and other business needs. We see this type of phenomenon described in the book, <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. To briefly summarize the model they use, there are two modes that humans use when they reason about their decisions, System 1 and System 2.</p><blockquote>Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine — usually.</blockquote><p>No surprise, that’s usually the part where we get into trouble. While we like to think that we are generally thinking in the logical System 2 mode, we don't have time or energy to live in this space for long periods throughout the day and we find ourselves very reliant on System 1 for much of our decision making.</p><blockquote>The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. The amount and quality of the data on which the story is based are largely irrelevant. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions.</blockquote><p>This is why benchmarketing can be so dangerous because it is so effective at manipulating our belief in claims that simply aren't true. These decisions affect how your architecture will unfold, your time-to-value, and lost hours for your team and customers. It makes having these systems that fairly compare the performance and merits of two systems all-the-more paramount.</p><figure><img src="http://bitsondata.dev/content/images/2020/09/significant.png" alt=""><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">https://xkcd.com/882/</a></figcaption></figure><p>So why am I talking about this now?</p><p>I have become a pretty big fanboy of a <a href="https://prestosql.io/">Presto</a>, a distributed query engine that runs interactive queries from many sources. I have witnessed firsthand how fast a cluster of Presto nodes are able to process through a huge amount of data at blindingly fast speeds. When you dive into how these speeds are achieved you find that this project is an incredible modern feat of solid engineering that makes interactive analysis over petabytes of data a reality. Going into all the reasons I like this project would be too tangential but it fuels the fire for why I believe this message needs to be heard.</p><p>Recently there was a "benchmark" that came out comparing the performance of a commercial competitor and Presto open-source and enterprise versions, touting performance improvements over Presto by an amount that would have been called out as too high in a CSI episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU">&lt;insert canonical csi clip here&gt;</a>. If you need to find out what I’m talking about, simply google "presto benchmark 3000" and you will find the benchmark along with plenty of other hype they've generated around these "findings". <a href="https://blog.yugabyte.com/yugabytedb-vs-cockroachdb-bringing-truth-to-performance-benchmark-claims-part-1/">Presto isn't the only system in the data space to come under similar types of attacks.</a> It makes sense too, as this type of technical peacocking is common as it successfully gains attention. </p><p>Luckily, as more companies strive to become transparent and associate themselves with open-source efforts, we are starting to see a relatively new pattern of open-source efforts emerge. Typically, you're used to hearing about open-source within the context of software projects maintained by open-source communities. We are now arriving at the age of any noun being able to be used in an open-source framework. There is open-source music, open-source education, and even open-source data. So why not reach a point where open-source benchmarking through consumer collaboration is a thing. This is not just for the sake of the consumers of these technologies who simply want to have more data to inform their design choices to better serve their clients, it's also unfortunate that this affects developer communities that are putting in a lot of hard work on these projects, only to have that hard work get berated unintelligibly by the likes of some corporate status competition.</p><p>Now I'm clearly a little biased when I tell you that I think Presto is currently the best analytics engine on the market today. When I say this, you really should be skeptical too. Really, I encourage it. You should verify in some way beyond a shadow of a doubt that:</p><p> &nbsp;1.

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>4</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>I’m currently working on a series of episodes for a Podcast I’ll be publishing soon. The Podcast will be in Italian and I wanted to make sure to publish the episode transcripts together with the audio episodes.</p>



<p>The idea of manually typing all the episodes text wasn’t really appealing to me so I started looking around.</p>



<h2>What are the tools out there?</h2>



<p>From a quick Google search, it seems that some companies are offering a mix of automated and human-driven transcription services.</p>



<p>I wasn’t really interested in that for now. I was, of course, just interested in consuming an API I could push my audio to and get back some text in a reasonable amount of time.</p>



<p>For this reason, I started looking for <em>speech-to-text</em> APIs and, of course, the usual suspects figured among the first results.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text">IBM Watson Speech-to-Text</a></li><li><a href="https://www.speechmatics.co/">SpeechMatics</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</a></li></ul>



<p>To be quite honest, I didn’t spend too much time investigating the solutions above. I probably spent more time reading about them to write this blog post.</p>



<p>I decided to go with Google Cloud because I’ve never used GCP before and wanted to give it a try. Additionally, the documentation for it seemed quite straightforward, as well as the support for Italian as language to transcribe from (the podcast is in Italian). I also had a few free credits available because I’ve never used GCP for personal use before.</p>



<h2>Setting up</h2>



<p>If you want to try transcribing your episodes too, follow this quick setup guide to get started.</p>



<p>Head over to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> and set up an account. Make sure you create a project and enable the Speech-to-Text API. If you forget to do so <code>gcloud</code> will be able to take care of that for you, later.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="509" height="99" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png" alt="Google Cloud Speech-to-Text" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59.png 509w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-13-at-20.24.59-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px"><figcaption>Google Cloud Speech-to-Text</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Second thing I did was installing <code><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts">gcloud</a></code>, the CLI Google Cloud provides for interacting with the APIs. This time I was only interested in testing the API so it seemed to me that this tool was the only way to get started quickly.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s not much you can do from the Google Cloud Web Console if you want to deal with Speech-to-Text APIs.</p>



<h3>Get your file ready for transcription</h3>



<p>Sampling rate for your audio file should be at least 16 kHz for better results. Additionally, GCP recommends a lossless codec. I only had an mp3 of my episode handy at the time so I gave it a try anyway and it worked well enough.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you know the sample rate of your file, though, because specifying a wrong one might lead to poor results.</strong></p>



<p>You can usually verify the sample rate by getting info on your file from your Mac’s Finder:</p>







<p>You can read more about the recommended settings on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/best-practices">Best Practices</a> section.</p>



<h3>Upload your episode to the bucket</h3>



<p>GCP needs your file to be available from a Storage Bucket so, go ahead and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets">create one</a>.</p>



<figure><img src="https://cloud.google.com/storage/images/create-bucket.png" alt=""><figcaption>Storage Bucket creation example</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to upload your episode from there.</p>



<h2>Time to transcribe</h2>



<p>Once you have your episode file up there in the cloud go back to your local machine terminal were you have configured the <code>gcloud</code> tool.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png" alt="" width="580" height="99" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1024x175.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-300x51.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-768x131.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1-1536x263.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>Gcloud used to trigger the speech-to-text transcription</figcaption></figure>



<p>If your episode lasts longer than 60 seconds (😬) you’ll want to use <code>recognize-long-running</code> and most likely specify <code>--async</code>. </p>



<p>As I said before, make sure you specify the right <code>--sample-rate</code>: in my case 44100. This will help GCP transcribe your file with better results.</p>



<p>The <code>--async</code> switch creates a long-running asynchronous operation. It took around 5 minutes for me to have the operation complete. </p>



<p>Oddly, I wasn’t able to find any reference to the asynchronous operation from my Google Cloud Console. So, if you want to be able to know what happened to your transcription job, make sure you take note of the operation identifier. You’ll need it to query the <code>speech operations</code> API for information about your transcription job.</p>

<h2>The transcribed data</h2>



<p>Once your transcription operation is complete the <code>describe</code> command will return the transcript excerpts, together with the confidence rate.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png" alt="" srcset="https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1024x641.png 1024w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-300x188.png 300w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-768x481.png 768w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3-1536x962.png 1536w, https://alediaferia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/carbon3.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The speech transcript excerpt</figcaption></figure>



<p>I wasn’t particularly interested in the <code>confidence</code> rate, I only wanted a big blob of text to be able to review and use for SEO purposes as well as to be able to include it with the episode. For this reason, <strong><em>jq to the resque!</em></strong></p>



<p>I love <code><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></code>, you can achieve so much with when it comes to manipulate JSON.</p>



<p>In my case, I only wanted to concatenate all the <code>transcript</code> fields and save them to a file. Here’s how I did:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ ./bin/gcloud ml speech operations describe &lt;your-transcription-operation-id&gt; | jq '.response.results[].alternatives[].transcript' &gt; my-transcript.txt</pre>



<p>And that’s it!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I thought of sharing the steps above because they’ve been useful to me in producing the transcripts. I think GCP Speech-to-Text works quite well with Italian but, of course, the transcript is not suitable to be used as it is, unless your accent is perfect. Mine wasn’t 😅.</p>

<h2 id="cs-294-165-fall-2020-syllabus-fall20-syllabus">CS 294-165 - Fall 2020 (<a href="https://www.sketchingbigdata.org/fall20/syllabus">Syllabus</a>)</h2>

<p><strong><strong>Sketching algorithms</strong></strong> compress data in a way that is still useful for answering some pre-specified family of queries, possibly across datasets by comparing sketches. This course will cover mathematically rigorous models for developing such algorithms, as well as some provable limitations of algorithms operating in those models. Some topics covered include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Streaming algorithms.</strong> Compute useful statistics over a dataset making only one pass over it, while using little memory.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Dimensionality reduction.</strong> General techniques and impossibility results for reducing data dimension while still preserving geometric structure.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Randomized linear algebra.</strong> Algorithms for big matrices (e.g. a user/product rating matrix for Netflix or Amazon). Regression, low rank approximation, clustering, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Compressed sensing.</strong> Recovery of (approximately) sparse signals based on few linear measurements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a graduate course, though there may be room for a limited number of advanced undergraduate students satisfying the following prerequisites: mathematical maturity and comfort with algorithms (e.g. CS 170), discrete probability, and linear algebra.</p>
