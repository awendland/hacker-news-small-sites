<h2 id="the-current-state">The current state</h2>
<p>There is a lot of hype about what the global distributed ledger aka “Blockchain” can do for society.
A “trust machine” as some people call it, that will bring the power of finance, data sovereignty and inclusion to the people,
hence rendering centralized intermediaries like Visa, Barclays &amp; Facebook obsolete.</p>
<p>We shall achieve this by using a combination of robust, battle tested cryptography &amp; game theory.</p>
<p>While this vision is plausible, realising it is not a easy as it may seem.</p>
<p>The blockchain is not yet ready.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-barriers-to-main-stream-adoption">The core barriers to main stream adoption</h2>
<p>The blockchain, while being a new concept in decentralized distributed databases has also presented a very unique set of problems in computer science &amp; economics that have never been solved at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Is this post, I will talk about the the 6 most important issues only with which if solved, shall we (blockchain enthusiasts) ever achieve our vision.</p>
<h3 id="1-scalability-issues">1. Scalability Issues</h3>
<p>The current bandwidth, i.e the data that can be transmitted through a blockchain with in a given time is simply too bounded for main stream adoption.</p>
<p>Ethereum for instance does a maximum of 13 transactions per second. Visa on the other hand can do 24,000 Transaction per second and peak over 40,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>So as you can see, the blockchain is thousands of magnitudes unable to manage a global traffic of financial transactions.
This is what they call the “Scalability Problem”</p>
<p>Coming up with a solution to scalability the problems without tarnishing the original value propositions of a blockchain (immutability/security, decentralization &amp; censorship resistance) is not trivial. It has been nick named the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#this-sounds-like-theres-some-kind-of-scalability-trilemma-at-play-what-is-this-trilemma-and-can-we-break-through-it">“scalability trilemma”</a> by Vitalik Buterine (Ethereum’s co-author).</p>
<h3 id="2-lack-of-intuitive-private-key-management">2. Lack of Intuitive Private Key Management</h3>
<p>Ordinary users will simply never wrap their heads around private keys.</p>
<p>Private keys, which are a string of text used to sign transactions and make other proofs(cryptographic).</p>
<p>The purpose for these proofs or signatures is for other entities on a blockchain network to verify identities &amp; messages amongst themselves without reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>Private keys have two main problems first, how to store them securely.<br>
Anyone who can memorize, take a picture, or copy your private key can literally steal all your money.
Because they have your private key, they can make the cryptographic proofs/signatures and <em>accurately prove to everyone on the network they are you</em> even without your consent. Even when they are not you.</p>
<p>Second, you loose your key you loose access to all your money &amp; <em>no one can ever help you out</em>.
There is no “click here to remember your private key”</p>
<p>We need to first come up with something as intuitive using ATM/Debit cards.</p>
<p>Imagine if your bank told you that, “if you forgot your Debit card PIN, you loose access to all your money with <em>zero hope of recovering it how ever large a sum of money it would be</em>”.</p>
<p>If the above was the case, I don’t think any one would use debit cards.</p>
<h3 id="3-contract-security">3. Contract security</h3>
<p>It is simply not reliable &amp; safe for responsible institutions &amp; individuals to deploy smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p>Due to the blockchain having an immutable and unpredictable state, Smart contracts deployed on such a platform are also expected to suffer from immutable bugs &amp; unpredictable events.</p>
<p>As a result, millions of dollars have been lost in events such as the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/">theft of $50 million from TheDAO</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/startup-lost-160-million-still-wants-shake-ethereum/"> Parity’s $160 Million loss of funds</a></p>
<p>I was glad that Rick dudley <a href="https://youtu.be/1AGHAuWz_4U?t=986">talked about this</a></p>
<h3 id="4-consensus-algorithms-are-wack">4. Consensus algorithms are wack</h3>
<p>The popular blockchains only don’t offer transaction finality i.e you will never be 100% sure that you have gotten funds.</p>
<p>You can only be <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/319/what-number-of-confirmations-is-considered-secure-in-ethereum">probabilistically to a high degree</a> (but with zero guarantee) that you have received your funds.
This is because in major consensus algorithm called Nakamoto Consensus, the miners elect the chain with the most computational work that are with in the same protocol i.e consensus rules.</p>
<p>For instance imagine your bank tells you that you that, “there is a 95% chance that we <em>might</em> have your life savings, however you may also not poses it in 5 years in case we discovered that the chain with the most work does not have your transaction in it”</p>
<p>Yes, I don’t think anyone wants to keep their life savings in such a bank.</p>
<h3 id="5-privacy">5. Privacy</h3>
<p>Just by knowing someone’s cryptocurrency address, you can know their account balance &amp; transaction history simply by pasting it in a blockchain explorer like <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/">etherscan</a></p>
<p>Meaning it’s very easy for anyone to keep track of your financial activities without permission.</p>
<p>You buy HIV drugs? I now know your HIV positive, Your paying schools fees? now your local kidnapper knows where your kids study.</p>
<p>Buying birth control pills? Now anyone in the world may accurately guess that your a woman.
No careful person wants that!</p>
<h3 id="6-price-volatility">6. Price volatility</h3>
<p>Very few people simply don’t have the stomach to hold a financial instrument that drops by over 50% with in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/26/bitcoin-price-in-2018-could-hit-60000-but-another-crash-is-coming.html">a few months</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>
<p>Most projects are building on platforms that have these problems regardless, in hopes that they will integrate solutions to the respective issues in the future.</p>
<p>The risk they face however, is that the platform they built on, my become obsolete after a heavy investment of time &amp; resources on the wrong platform.</p>
<p>Think how the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-now-useless-micropayments-solutions-are-coming1/">micro payments industry died in bitcoin because of high fees</a></p>
<p>It’s like building your phone app around a windows smart-phone only to be made irrelevant because the next generation of mobile users will not be using windows smart-phones, but iOS and Android.</p>

<p>As the pandemic runs its course, tracking genetic mutations has gained mainstream coverage. Officially, in the line of work we call bioinformatics, finding and understanding mutations is known as <em>Variant Calling</em>. In the same way every person is different from others (except twins), an individual virus can have variations in their genome; when a lot of these genetic variations accumulate between the virus we detected originally and what we find months later in a faraway town, we can say that we have a new <em>strain</em> of the virus. The Coronavirus which we’re now calling <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> was first detected in Wuhan中国, so the genetic sequencing data from here is used as the base reference genome, and we measure mutations for the virus detected everywhere else against this; a coronavirus genome from a few towns away might only have a couple letters of the genome different from the Wuhan data, while something that’s travelled to the other side of the world after being transmitted through many people, climates, and even treatments, might now have acquired many more genetic variants compared to the original data.</p>
<h4 id="fig-2-retrieving-raw-covid-data-from-sra--creating-alignment-maps">Fig 2. Retrieving raw COVID data from SRA &amp; creating alignment maps</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/render1612723995528-min.gif" alt="samtools tview" title="SARS-CoV-2 Aligned">
Data from viruses sequenced all across the world are uploaded into one of several databases (Table 1), this data is generated directly from machines by Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, or Life Technologies. When turning the molecules in genetic code into digital files these machines create strings that can be a few hundred letters in length to several thousand, but never the entire genome of the virus in a single string. A standardized file format called <em>fastq</em> holds all the strings from a single sample, including some quality data from the machine doing the sequencing. These strings are in no particular order, and first need to be mapped together to get the complete genome. Pretty much the standard way to create these genetic maps uses a technique invented in Palo Alto back in the early 90s by &nbsp;Michael Burrows and David Wheeler. The <em>Burrows–Wheeler Transform</em> was mostly just used in data compression, until around 2010 when computational biologists began to use it to align genomes together.</p>

<h4 id="table-1">Table 1.</h4>
<p><strong>SRA:</strong> <em>Sequence Read Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>ENA:</strong> <em>European Nucleotide Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>GISAID:</strong> <em>Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data</em> <strong>-Private</strong></p>

<p>Heng Li, now a professor at Harvard (amongst other things) has created the most commonly used alignment algorithm (amongst other things) with <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">BWA</a>. This algorithm is super easy to use, and will get us results that are more than good enough.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
cd bwa
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BWA takes <strong>fastq</strong> files containing samples, along with a <em>fasta</em> file containing a reference genome to map the strings contained in our <strong>fastq</strong> file. Reference genomes are usually put out by the scientific wing of a National Government, Regional Organizations, and some Universities. We’ll get our Wuhan Coronavirus Reference genome from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> hosted by the US Federal government. A good sample to run against the Wuhan reference is the Washington state outbreak that happened early in the US, the <em>fastq</em> data for this is also hosted by the NCBI at their <a href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR11278092">Sequence Read Archive</a>. In the animated terminal above (Fig 2.) we see the commands needed to create our mapped genome from our input files, including retrieving the data from the databases . If you’d like to skip all that, we’re hosting both the reference genome, and the completed alignment map over at <a href="https://lucidalign.com/#cov">Lucid Align</a>. We’ll be using the <strong>bam</strong> file to detect our mutations, and we can also browse the genome of this Washington state outbreak sample using any sequence alignment viewer.</p>

<h4 id="fig-3-detecting-mutations-with-neural-network">Fig 3. Detecting Mutations with Neural Network</h4>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5z5OV6UAVM" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>But before going on to variant calling this first sample let’s just prepare another sample while we’re making these alignment maps. Let’s do a more recent outbreak, from Kent, UK; which is far from Wuhan &amp; the Washington sample, in both time &amp; space. Retrieving the samples from the European Nucleotide Archive can be done from this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR4659819">link</a> or from the shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools.git
cd python3
enaDataGet.py -f fastq -m -d [output_directory] ERR4659819
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Creating the mapped genome from the Kent, UK outbreak is done the exact same way as with the Washington state outbreak, and now both files can be browsed directly with an alignment viewer. More importantly now we can run the <em>variant detection</em> and see all the mutations in each of these samples compared to the original Wuhan reference genome. Variant callers are an area of hot development for folks working on bioinformatics algorithms &amp; tools. Traditionally, Bayesian methods have been most reliable, but are hard-coded for specific organisms or need the settings dialed-in to get the correct sensitivity to specificity. This is so that we don’t get too many false-positives, while at the same time don’t miss any real mutations. In the last couple of years deep convolutional neural networks have really made a splash in variant calling, where now images are created almost similar to those we see from alignment viewers, and those images are used to train, and then have the neural network make the call on whether there is a mutation in a given section of the alignment map as we make our way down the entire map.</p>

<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/eff_kent.png" alt="Annotated VCF" title="High Impact mutation in Kent UK sample"></p>
<h4 id="fig-4-annotated-mutations-of-kent-uk-strain-b117">Fig 4. Annotated Mutations of Kent UK Strain B.1.1.7</h4>

<p>Bayesian variant callers are fairly simple to install, whereas the DCNN callers will need, in our case, Nvidia cuda drivers, and of course a machine with those GPUs. You could use <a href="https://magnolia.sh/">Magnolia</a> Fig 3., the super-cool neural network based caller that Leo van Driel helped write B-), but for this post we are going to use the built-in caller that comes with <a href="http://www.htslib.org/download/"><em>samtools</em></a> written by the previously mentioned Heng Li.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bcftools mpileup -Ou -f &lt;ref.fasta&gt; &lt;sample1.bam&gt; | bcftools call -vmO z -o &lt;study.vcf.gz&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running any variant caller, we’re left with a <em>vcf</em> file, which is just a list of positions in a genome where the sample has a mutation compared to the reference, it might be good to just look at the file <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf">format specifications</a> to understand how these <em>vcf</em> files will be used moving forward. We can use the allotted fields in the <em>vcf</em> format to annotate, that is give meaning &amp; context to each of the mutations we detect in the genome. For this sample we’ve used <a href="https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/users_of_snpeff/">SnpEff</a> which makes life super easy by boiling all of the predicted effects of each of the mutations we detected into 3 simple categories, high impact, low, and moderate.</p>

<p>We can see in Fig 4. that running a standard Bayesian variant caller we detected a total of 48 mutations in the Kent UK sample. However, there might be some false-positives in there, it’s always better to be a bit more sensitive than to miss things. Let’s focus on the high impact mutations, things that will change the 3D structure of coronavirus. Looks like we only have 3 of those, all highlighted in red (Fig 4.), at genomic positions, 11288, 27972, and 28270. The VCF file we generated also contains data on which amino acids within the protein structure were changed to what, we can use that information to make the changes in our molecular structure, which in this case we’ve done with a current tool under development.</p>
<h4 id="fig-5-molecular-structure-editor">Fig 5. Molecular Structure Editor</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/dalton_beta.gif" alt="Dalton PDB" title="Editing Molecular Structure"></p>

<p>Mutations which change the molecular structure are super important because that is more likely to make things behave differently, this can mean it attaches to human receptors more tightly, interacts with antibodies and drugs differently, because remember at the core of how molecules behave is the old mantra <strong>“form equals function.</strong>”</p>

                        you'll open a VS Code window into the running instance at the users <b>/app</b> home directory.
                        To start with a clean folder free of clutter, you can run <b>code src</b> to open a new VS Code window
                        into the empty <b>src</b> folder.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Start from your languages "Hello World"</h4>

                    <p>
                        To quickly get started playing with each language use the built-in
                        <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool">x tool</a>
                        to download any GitHub repo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make it easy, <a href="https://github.com/gistcafe">gistcafe</a>
                        has a <em>hello-*</em> repo for each language that supports running a single source file <em>"Hello World"</em>
                        which you can browse with:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Run it!</h3>

                    <pre><label>x download gistcafe | grep hello-</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>

                    <p>
                        Then download the language you want, e.g you can download &amp; run a <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> "Hello World" App with:
                    </p>

                    <pre><label>x download gistcafe/hello-deno &amp;&amp; cd hello-deno</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>
                    <pre><label>deno run hello.ts</label><b></b><i title="copy" onclick="copy(this)"></i></pre>

                    <h4>Start from a language project template</h4>

                    <p>
                        For installing all other non-single file (i.e. <em>hello-*</em>) repos you'll instead want to use <b>x new</b> so it applies all

                        Once you're ready to share your new App with the world you can publish it to a GitHub Gist by generating a
                        <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">GitHub Access Token</a> with <b>gist</b> scope
                        and adding it to your <em>GITHUB_TOKEN</em> Environment Variable:

                    <p>
                        Then to publish your App to a new Gist, run:

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc</a>, which sends and receives video (and audio, but it’s only partially supported now) streams between frontend and backend via WebRTC.<br>
This should be helpful for creating, for example, performant real-time computer vision WebApps.</p>
<p>This week I tried Steamlit, found it interesting and useful, and then wanted to run real-time computer vision apps on Streamlit, on which users can try some computer vision models with video input from their webcams.<br>
So I tried to develop a component to achieve it using WebRTC. Fortunately, there is a great WebRTC library for Python, <a href="https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">aiortc</a>.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about this component is that the input video streams are sourced from users’ webcams and transferred to the server-side Python process via the network. Therefore, the server does not need the access to the camera, unlike the usual approach using OpenCV (<code>cv2.VideoCapture</code>). It means the Python code can be hosted on a remote server (actually, I hosted a sample app on Heroku and it worked, as stated below).</p>
<p>In addition, WebRTC provides good performance with sending and receiving video/audio frames.</p>
<p>Here is a demo movie:<br>
</p><div><a href="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/original/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24.gif" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/oYIcsMqSqHFlA92m5f3NdANeujO.gif?dl=1" title="streamlit-webrtc-demo-short1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/original/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24.gif" alt="streamlit-webrtc-demo-short1" data-base62-sha1="oYIcsMqSqHFlA92m5f3NdANeujO" width="549" height="500" data-small-upload="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business7/uploads/streamlit/optimized/2X/a/af111a7393c77cb69d7712ac8e71ca862feaeb24_2_10x10.png"></a></div><p>
(A full version is hosted on <a href="https://youtu.be/BRrtN80ITfU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">YouTube</a>)</p>
<p>You can see</p>
<ul>
<li>The app consumes, processes, and renders video frames in real time.</li>
<li>Streamlit’s interactive controls are still working well in combination with the code using WebRTC. For example, the threshold for object detection is changed interactively during execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try out the sample app using the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install streamlit-webrtc opencv-python
$ streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py
</code></pre>
<p>I also deployed it to Heroku, <a href="https://streamlit-webrtc-example.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://streamlit-webrtc-example.herokuapp.com/</a> and confirmed it worked; however, it’s running on a very small instance on a free plan, and may not work well if multiple users access it at the same time.<br>
I recommend you to run it on your own environment.</p>
<p>It’s still a prototype and the API is not finalized, and the documentation has not been written. Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/master/app.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the sample code</a> when you use the component.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback!</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Technical note:</p>
<p>One technical challenge was to combine WebRTC and real-time processing with Streamlit’s execution model. This problem has already been stated in <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/access-webcam-video-from-a-hosted-streamlit-application/1301">Access Webcam Video from a hosted Streamlit application</a>.<br>
In case of <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> , additionally, <a href="https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">aiortc</a> does not work in normal Streamlit scripts, which are executed from top to bottom and terminated at each user interaction (more fundamentally, it’s because of WebRTC’s async nature).</p>
<p>This library approaches this problem by creating threads independent of Streamlit execution.<br>
When the component is used for the first time, it forks a thread, launches <code>aiortc</code>’s code on an event loop in the thread, and maintains the thread over all the script executions until the WebRTC session is closed.</p>
<p>As a result of this approach, developers should alter their programming style when using this library, from Streamlit’s declarative way to an event-and-callback-based one. <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37/app.py#L293-L303" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc/app.py at 477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37 · whitphx/streamlit-webrtc · GitHub</a> is an example. In this code, the computer vision part resides in a callback function, which is called from the forked thread triggered by the media stream regardless of Streamlit’s execution timing.</p>
<p>To bridge this forked execution of WebRTC and normal Streamlit’s controls, <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> exposes a <code>context</code> object, which is an interface to the objects running in the WebRTC’s async world.<br>
By using it, values from Streamlit’s controls can be passed to the computer vision code running in the forked thread, like <a href="https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc/blob/477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37/app.py#L305-L317" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">streamlit-webrtc/app.py at 477416da84e77d76201d97269589fe5ff5d17d37 · whitphx/streamlit-webrtc · GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I think it’s because you are using python &lt;3.8 <s>though <code>streamlit-webrtc</code> currently supports only &gt;=3.8.<br>
Please try with python 3.8.</s></p>
<p><s>I will also fix the package to be compatible with older versions of Python.</s></p>
<p>EDIT: I updated the package to be compatible with Python 3.6 and 3.7. Please try again.</p>

          <p>I got an invitation to Streamlit Sharing then deployed the sample app there: <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://share.streamlit.io/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc-example/main/app.py</a><br>
but it didn’t work with a “permission denied” error when the app requires capturing video or audio from user’s device.</p>
<p>It means many interesting applications of this component, including real-time object detection and image transformation, cannot be used on Streamlit Sharing…<br>
The only page of the sample app that works is the third one, where the app plays video and audio files on server-side and transmit them to the client.</p>
<p>This is because, on Streamlit Sharing, the app is running inside iframe.<br>
<code>getUserMedia</code>, which is used to get access to user’s device, requires Feature Policy when called inside iframe.<br>

		<p>The issue of gender disparities within the fields of Science, Technology,&nbsp;Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is one that’s kept academics and feminists&nbsp;alike busy for centuries.</p>
<p>Since the emergence of such disciplines over the course of the 18th century,&nbsp;women have typically lagged behind their male counterparts in terms of&nbsp;representation; and considerable discourse has been sparked (as well as many&nbsp;the heated debate) so as to figure out <em>why.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2><strong>The Gender-Equality Paradox in STEM&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting phenomenon to consider — the concept that more&nbsp;progressive countries wherein you’d expect to find&nbsp;greater&nbsp;equality&nbsp;and thus an equal, if not larger, number of women working in STEM, the&nbsp;opposite is, in fact, occurring.</p>
<p>This was what was proposed by Gijsbert&nbsp;Stoet and David C. Geary, authors&nbsp;of the controversial 2018 study <a href="http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/4753/6/symplectic-version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and&nbsp;Mathematics Education”;</a>&nbsp;controversial because upon attempts by Harvard researchers to recreate the&nbsp;results produced by this study, they came up short.</p>
<p><span>In response, Stoet and Geary clarified in a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620904134">reply to said researchers at Harvard, published February 2020</a><span>&nbsp;that “men are more likely than women to enter STEM careers because of&nbsp;endogenous interest”, marking a shift from their original&nbsp;hypothesis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It begs the question: Is it simply a matter of interest? That women, because&nbsp;of their more nurturing and caring tendencies, opt for occupations&nbsp;characterised by providing aid (a notable example being nursing, a primarily&nbsp;female-dominated profession worldwide), whereas men, <a href="http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47af/4a7e87267aba681fb6971590ec80effce0c3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who express stronger inclinations towards working with things rather than&nbsp;people</a>, dominate careers within the fields of mathematics and engineering?</p>
<p>Or is it indeed deep-rooted in inequality and gender discrimination? Do women&nbsp;exhibit lower levels of interest in STEM degrees not simply because of innate&nbsp;predispositions, but because they are discouraged, either actively or&nbsp;subliminally, from pursuing them at a young age?</p>
<p><span>This is, arguably, where much of the debate stems from. And perhaps there&nbsp;is no right or wrong answer. Nevertheless, open discussions and constructive&nbsp;conversations with those holding differing perspectives can only serve to&nbsp;help advance existing knowledge on the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>So Why the Underrepresentation?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000253479">this text</a>&nbsp;published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural&nbsp;Organisation (UNESCO), “discrimination, biases, social norms and expectations&nbsp;that influence the quality of education women receive and the subjects they&nbsp;study” are reasons cited as to blame for gender disparity in STEM.</p>
<p>However, some may argue that it’s not patriarchal barriers keeping women out&nbsp;of STEM as the above work by UNESCO might suggest, but rather the biological&nbsp;reality that women are hard-wired differently to men, and vice versa.</p>
<p>It’s not a concept unfamiliar to many — the psychological and behavioural&nbsp;differences between men and women has long been an area that’s generated&nbsp;substantial interest in popular culture.&nbsp;You might have even heard the&nbsp;saying “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus”. This metaphor, coined by the&nbsp;eponymously titled book, was authored by American relationship counsellor John&nbsp;Gray, and has sold millions worldwide.</p>
<p>Although the views expressed within it are now widely considered to be&nbsp;outdated (having been&nbsp;originally published in 1992), in essence, one of&nbsp;the central points Gray highlights is this — that women tend to think&nbsp;emotionally, whilst men tend to think logically.</p>
<p>Though many may decry this notion (as well as the book altogether),&nbsp;criticising it for stereotyping human psychology, some may also consider it&nbsp;naïve to believe men and women are truly wired the same — that there do,&nbsp;indeed, exist inherent and fundamental differences in the psychology of the&nbsp;sexes.</p>
<p>And it’s this belief that lends itself to the explanation of why certain&nbsp;professions are predominantly female, whilst others remain predominately male.</p>
<p>Yet, it could be considered <em>just</em> as naïve to believe we live in an&nbsp;ideal world where the barriers that, for <em>centuries</em>, held women back&nbsp;from achieving equality have been completely eliminated.&nbsp;Society has&nbsp;certainly come a long way in advancing women’s rights and shedding&nbsp;stereotypical notions of gender roles, but to act like women no longer&nbsp;experience discrimination of any kind on the basis of their gender, even in&nbsp;our modern-day 21st century, may be a dire mistake.</p>
<h2><strong>The Wider Gender Gap Context</strong></h2>
<p>According to the Global Gender Gap Report, annually published by the World&nbsp;Economic Forum, the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is one that measures gender&nbsp;equality through&nbsp;“benchmark[ing] national gender gaps on economic,&nbsp;education, health and political criteria”.</p>
<p>The most recent&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 edition of the report</a>&nbsp;ranked Malaysia as 104th amongst 153 countries overall, and 86th within the&nbsp;subindex of Educational Attainment — one of four subindexes, with the other&nbsp;three being Economic Participation, Health and Survival and Political&nbsp;Empowerment.</p>
<p>Despite what may seem like average rankings for Malaysia, you might be pleased&nbsp;to know that though the computer industry is one typically dominated by men,&nbsp;this isn’t the case in Malaysia, where women comprise over 50% of employees&nbsp;within the field. Additionally, as of 2011, women held 49% of research&nbsp;positions in the sciences, technologies and innovations; a pretty much 50/50&nbsp;split.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s Being Done About It?</strong></h2>
<p>There exists a plethora of resources and workshops hosted by organisations,&nbsp;both globally and within Malaysia, dedicated to inspiring young women to&nbsp;pursue their passions within STEM industries.</p>
<p>One such example is&nbsp;<a href="https://women-in-tech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in Tech,</a> a global movement with members spanning across 100+ countries, whose&nbsp;objectives revolve around the empowerment of women with the confidence and&nbsp;skills needed to excel in STEM fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A while ago, I’ve been working on a very large codebase that consisted of a few million lines of code.
Large systems are usually a big mess and this one was no exception.
Since this is a rather common problem in software engineering, I thought the internet would be
littered with stories about this topic.
There is a lot of talk about software carpentry, while software maintenance is rarely debated.
Either large programs are being maintained by dark matter developers or
nobody thinks that writing stories about large systems are interesting enough.</p><p>In the past I’ve encountered a few of those large monsters and they seem to have a lot in common.
This article will try to present some of the problems and tricks that I am using when
I have to deal with them. Hopefully this will inspire others to write similar posts
and share tips from their own bag of tricks.</p><h2 id="large-codebase-problems">Large codebase problems</h2><p>The main problem of any large codebase is the extreme complexity that stems from the fact
that we live in a messy world of details that are very hard to describe and put into words.
The programming languages that we are using nowadays are still too primitive for that task,
and it takes a lot of lines and various layers of abstractions before we are able to convey the
rules of our world to the all mighty computer [1].</p><p>The following sections will present some of the common problems which I’ve discovered during my
big system adventures.</p><p>A common trait of a large codebases is that at some point they become so large and bloated
that one person alone is no longer capable of understanding all its pieces. It seems to
me that after 100’000 lines of code, the maintenance related problems start to appear
as the complexity of the code simply dwarfs the capabilities of the human brain.
Such large systems are commonly maintained by more than one person, but with a large
group of people also come large organizational problems.</p><p>Within a large group of people the number of possible communication paths between them go bananas
and so it often happens that the ass no longer knows what the head is doing.
This misunderstanding in turn cause them to build the wrong thing that doesn’t fit
into the rest of the system. You might also know this situation under the term of
“those people had no idea what they were doing, and we will do it right this time” which is
quite often floating around in the latest maintenance team.</p><p>That rarely happens though, because it’s likely the Towel of Babel situation all over again.</p><h3 id="loss-of-knowledge">Loss of knowledge</h3><p>Large systems are usually maintained by the ones who did not build them. Initial
developers often leave the company or move up in the pecking order to
work on other projects and are therefore no longer familiar with the system.
Sometimes the bright minds outsourced the initial development of the project
in the name of lowering the costs, just to pay tenfold in the later stages once they realize
the outsourcers developed the wrong thing. Even worse is the fact that the in house developers
didn’t gain the internal domain knowledge that is necessary for further maintenance of the system.</p><p>This presents a big problem for the new maintainers, as they can’t just go
around the company and ask the original developers about the initial design decisions.
Learning this tribal knowledge usually takes a lot of time, because the code is harder to read and
understand than it is to write. These days most developers seem to switch jobs every 2 to 3 years,
therefore the learning process has to be constantly going on, otherwise you might end up
with a large and expensive monster that nobody knows anything about [2].
For most of the past large projects on which I’ve been working on, the team has usually
changed by the end of the first version.</p><p>Rigorously documenting every step is not the cure for this problem, because at some point all that
junk will become outdated and nobody will have the time to spend a year just reading the
documentation and figuring out how the pieces fit together [3].</p><h3 id="lack-of-knowledge">Lack of knowledge</h3><p>Large systems become large, because they are usually trying to solve every problem under the sun.
Often the organization that is embarking on such journey does not have enough experienced
employees on board to actually pull it off. Some like to say that pressure makes diamonds,
but sometimes it also crushes the things that are under.</p><p>It’s fine to have less experienced people working on a large system as long as they have the elders
overseeing their work. In the world where senior titles are handed left and right,
that is often not the case and it’s how you end up with a very fragile system that is suitable for
a replacement as soon as it was built. Most of the larger projects that I was working on and
were considered successes, had the core parts of the system written by experienced
developers. A significant chunks were also built by greenhorns, but they were usually
guided and their blast radius was limited to the less complex parts of the system.</p><h3 id="the-astronauts">The astronauts</h3><p>Big projects tend to attract the data modelers and other cultists who like to
get in the way of getting shit done. These architecture astronauts will endlessly
discuss the finer points of their UML data models and multithreaded layers of abstraction,
that will one day allow them to be the heroes of their own story by writing some well
encapsulated and “SOLID” code.</p><blockquote><p>Why IBM sales reps don’t have children?</p><p>Because all they do is sit on the bed telling their spouses how great it’s going to be.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the for loopers have to fight this creeping metadata bureaucracy
madness on a daily basis. The tools handed down to them from the ivory tower usually don’t stand
the heat of the battle, but that doesn’t bother the modelers who will try to fix
the problems with more obfuscation patterns. It’s how you end with a homebrewed middleware monstrosity,
because the 100 existing ones out there are obviously not up to the task of powering our little CRUD app.</p><h3 id="documentation-problems">Documentation problems</h3><blockquote><p>I like to keep documentation separated from the code. Who am I?</p><p>A fool, with an out of sync document.</p></blockquote><p>The documentation of any large system is almost always outdated.
The code is usually changing faster due to the endless edge cases of the system
that were not being thought of early on. The discovered edge case problems are
usually fixed by bolting additional functionality right on the spot.
The average code change of such patch is usually quite small,
but a few tweaks here and there accumulate over time until the original design no
longer matches with the reality.</p><p>Tweaking the code is usually simple as most people are familiar with the process. You pull the
code from the version control, you make your tweaks and then you push it back.
On the other hand updating the documentation is way more convoluted and usually involves the
whole ceremony, because the term documentation is actually a spaghetti of Word documents,
pdfs, spreadsheets, emails, wiki pages and some text files on some dude’s hard drive.</p><p>The corporate world still loves to use MS Word for writing technical documents, even though
it’s entirely unusable for this use case. The Word doesn’t support syntax highlighting for
code snippets and you get to play the game of “moving one image for 5 pixels to the
left will mess with your headings and right align all text.”
It also makes it very hard to have multiple people collaborating on the same document.
The version control still treats Word documents in the same way as binary blobs,
which makes merging changes and fixing merge conflicts far harder than it should be.
I still remember how people collaborated by working each on their own copy of the
document and having a documentation officer merging all the copies together
manually to avoid any merge conflicts. Fun times.</p><p>If you are lucky, you might be writing documentation in plain text, but then you may have to
get familiar with all kinds of weird Lovecraftian toolchains that are relying on
all sorts of ancient operating system specifics in order to produce a nicer looking document.</p><p>After all these years of progress, writing documentation is still an unpleasant process
due to all the pain surrounding the tools that we have to deal with on a daily basis.
Large projects ensure that not only is the documentation hard to write, it’s also
impossible to find and read due to the sheer number of documents [4].</p><h2 id="tackling-the-beast">Tackling the beast</h2><p>In this section I will describe my ways of tackling the problems of an unknown large codebase
that I often encounter in the wild.
As mentioned before, the main problem of large systems is that nobody can understand them
entirely and often you will be left wondering how the damn thing even works.</p><p>When you are trying to understand a specific part of a large system, it’s worth
taking the time to talk to the current maintainers. They usually know it well enough
to guide you through the jungle, so you can avoid the traps and get up to speed faster.
Sometimes you will encounter a situation where you will just have to figure it
out on your own, because nobody will have the answers to your questions.</p><p>Hopefully the following sections might give you some ideas on how to tackle such
situations.</p><h3 id="read-the-documentation">Read the documentation</h3><p>The easiest way to get familiar with a large system, is by going through its documentation and
actually reading it. Large systems usually contain
large swaths of outdated documentation, but even a slightly outdated document is
often better than not having it at all. Ask the elders about the current state of documentation,
so you don’t completely waste your time with deciphering the irrelevant documents.</p><p>Either way, the documentation will only give you an overview of the system. The details
behind design decisions are almost never mentioned and you will have to find another way.</p><h3 id="check-the-tests">Check the tests</h3><p>When I am trying to decipher how a specific part of the system is supposed to behave,
I usually check for tests. If they exist, you might want to scroll through them and hopefully
you will get another …</p></div></div>

I saw someone on a programming stream yesterday claim that they prefer raw c because it feels more <em>intuitive</em>. To me, this just seems out of touch with reality. Lets look at the simplest REPL, from <a href="https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/parts/part1.html">part 1</a> of the cstack database from scratch series. I think by the end anyone would agree with me that the c++ version of this code is better in every way to its c counterpart.</p><p>What we are creating here, REPL for short, is a very common introductory tool for someone just getting used to working with a SQL database. It allows a beginner user to interact with the database line by line, discovering how SQL works through tinkering with the language. Many of these REPL shells are also used in scripting languages, and its the default mode that python starts in if you pass it no arguments.</p><p>In this part, we are just looking at the simplest REPL ever, which just prompts the user with some context in the terminal, and allows lines of input to be evaluated. The only command we are evaluating for now is just the SQL .exit metacommand. Any other commands passed to our program are unrecognized. Here is the c version:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

    <p>I’m sure you’ve come across the age-old, opinion-based debate of ‘Tabs vs. Spaces’ for <em>indentation</em> before. It has been going since forever, and there seem to be valid reasons for both sides:</p>
<p><strong>Tabs…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>smaller files because it’s just 1 character</li>
<li>that’s what they’re used for</li>
<li>you can customize your own indentation width (👈 keep this one in mind)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spaces…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to avoid problems in whitespace-sensitive environments</li>
<li>because you know what you’ll get, and consistency is key</li>
</ul>
<p>But, there’s more to this than just personal preferences. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChaseMoskal">u/ChaseMoskal</a> recently posted a very insightful and eye-opening post on Reddit with the title <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/">“Nobody talks about the real reason to use Tabs over Spaces”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-real-reason-to-use-tabs-over-spaces">The one real reason to use tabs over spaces</h2>
<p>In his post, Chase explains his own experience of using spaces at his workplace, and the negative effects it had on co-workers with visual impairment.</p>
<p>One of his co-workers uses a tab-width of <code>1</code>, to avoid huge indentations when using a large font-size.</p>
<p>Another co-worked of his is using a tab-width of <code>8</code> because that works best for his situation with a wide monitor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see people saying “tabs lets us customize our tab-width”, as though we do this “for fun” — Chase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using tabs in our projects, we allow these kinds of customizations that are <em>essential</em> for people with visual impairment. Custom tab-widths might seem like an unnecessary thing to most, but some people rely on it—and we <em>can not</em> ignore that.</p>
<h2 id="accessible-first">Accessible first</h2>
<p>We simply can’t “convert” everyone to one side or the other, there’s no question about it. Everyone has their own preferences, and we should celebrate that freedom—that we have the ability to make our own choices.</p>
<p>But with that said, we should also make sure to include <em>everyone</em>, and that means respecting and using accessible tools like the Tab-character.</p>
<p>Much like designing for ‘mobile first’—making sure everyone, no matter what device, has a great experience with your product—we should create an ‘<strong>accessible first</strong>’ environment, by making sure that everyone has the same ability to work, whether it’s at the workplace or on an open-source project.</p>
<p>I thought Chase put it perfectly when he said in his post that <em>"…there’s just no counter-argument that even comes close to outweighing the accessibility needs of valued coworkers”</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--accessible-first-personal-preference-second">Conclusion — Accessible first, personal preference second</h2>
<p>By defaulting to tabs, we make sure that everyone has a great experience working together with others, no matter their own abilities.</p>
<p>And if you prefer spaces, feel free to use an auto-formatting tool that converts tabs to spaces when opening a file (all modern editors have these). Just make sure that the spaces get converted back to tabs before anyone else has to work on your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by making sure everyone has the same capability can we maximize our combined potential ❤️</p>
</blockquote>

Some of the best address specific barriers that need consideration. Others consider various perspectives that can get in our way. And still others provide an excellent roadmap for achieving success through real practical tools and activities. If you want this year to be your best, you may consider investing in some of these enlightening books. While several are worthwhile, the following five self-help books can help you achieve your goals and should definitely be on your reading list.</p><figure><img width="212" height="313" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg 212w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life-203x300.jpg 203w" data-sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life.jpg 212w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/project-bold-life-203x300.jpg 203w"></figure><p><strong>Project Bold Life – The Proven Formula to Take on Challenges and Achieve Happiness and Success by Edward M. Kopko</strong></p><p>There are goals, and there are Bold Goals. Bold Goals are those that stretch us to our limits and allow us to overcome some of the most profound challenges. In doing so, we enjoy the pursuit of the Boldest Life possible, regardless of our specific situation. This is the perspective that Ed Kopko shares in his inspirational and critically acclaimed book, PROJECT BOLD LIFE (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Bold-Life-Challenges-Happiness-ebook/dp/B08DX38H7B">which is available on Kindle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Project-Bold-Life-Challenges-Happiness/dp/1735334901">in paperback on Amazon</a>). Hands down, this is certainly one of the best engaging self-help books for those who want to be their best. <a href="https://www.projectboldlife.com/achievement/setting-life-goals/">Kopko breaks down the vital steps that go into creating goals</a>. (Hint: It’s not as easy as you think.) He also provides specific worksheets, formulas, and planners to help anyone in the process. As Kopko points out, many of us have faith in our abilities but we never truly act courageously on this faith.

Grover</strong></p><p>What does it take to go from being just good to being the best? What characteristics do those people who are considered to be among the best–superior athletes, successful businessmen, and more–share that make them great? Author Tim. S. Grover takes a relative view when it comes to self-help, bringing others into the self-improvement equation and using their traits as a guide. But ultimately, his premise is that you can’t count on anyone else to give you motivation–it must come from within. It is filled with great stories about athletes he has trained. For that, plus its direct and honest approach, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Unstoppable-Tim-S-Grover-ebook/dp/B008O4TY3I">Relentless: From Good to Great to Unstoppable</a> is an essential read for anyone looking to make the most of themselves.</p><figure><img width="211" height="314" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg 211w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic-202x300.jpg 202w" data-sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic.jpg 211w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/big-magic-202x300.jpg 202w"></figure><p><strong><em>Big Magic – Creative Living Beyond Fear</em> by Elizabeth Gilbert</strong></p><p>For many of us, our largest goals involve a creative pursuit. Some involve writing a novel or painting a self-portrait. Others might include acting on Broadway or performing live in a band. All these creative pursuits, however, are very personal in nature, and we may resist pursuing such goals. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726">Elizabeth Gilbert tackles this subject in a unique way</a> and encourages us to be curious, fearless and loving. Gilbert’s approach is to embrace our creative side with both a sense of wonder and pragmatism. Sources of inspiration and creative ideas are everywhere, and all we need to do is recognize this. As one of the best self-help books for achieving creative goals, <em>Big Magic</em> is a great read.</p><figure><img width="182" height="296" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/you-badass.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/you-badass.jpg" alt=""></figure><p><strong><em>You Are a Badass – How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life</em> by Jen Sincero</strong></p><p>There are many books on positivity that you might include on your reading list for 2021. But <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass%C2%AE-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699">Jen Sincero takes a no-nonsense approach to self-care while infusing both humor and practicality in her book</a>. In essence, her message is one of self-understanding, self-love, and an awareness that growth and change are essential. With these acknowledgements and pursuits, anyone can be a “badass” and achieve their goals. Sincero also stresses the importance of being positive in one’s attitude and inviting a sense of courageousness.</p><figure><img width="208" height="313" src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg" data-src="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg 208w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly-199x300.jpg 199w" data-sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" srcset="https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly.jpg 208w, https://wimgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/daring-greatly-199x300.jpg 199w"></figure><p><strong><em>Daring Greatly – How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent and Lead</em> by Dr. Brenè Brown</strong></p><p>Brenè Brown has participated in over 12 years in research involving vulnerability, courage, shame and empathy. Few books tackle such topics well, which is why <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419">Daring Greatly is one of the best self-help books to know</a>. Brown demonstrates how dealing with past embarrassments and feelings of shame can be liberating. She has achieved great success with her work and her lecture Brene Brown: The Call to Courage debuted on Netflix in 2019. Not only can this book boost one’s affected self-esteem and self-worth, but it can also help individuals move on courageously in a truthful and bold way. Ultimately, this helps us achieve our goals in life and enjoy much deeper connections with others.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <h2>htmx 1.2.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.2.0/">1.2.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<h3>New Features &amp; Major Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>hx-vars</code> has been deprecated in favor of <code>hx-vals</code></li>
<li><code>hx-vals</code> now supports a <code>javascript:</code> prefix to achieve the behavior that <code>hx-vars</code> provided</li>
<li>The new <code>hx-headers</code> attribute allows you to add headers to a request via an attribute.  Like <code>hx-vals</code> it supports
JSON or javascript via the <code>javascript:</code> prefix</li>
<li><code>hx-include</code> will now include all inputs under an element, even if that element is not a form tag</li>
<li>The <a href="https://htmx.org/extensions/preload/">preload extension</a> now offers a <code>preload-images="true"</code> attribute that will aggressively load images in preloaded content</li>
<li>On requests driven by a history cache miss, the new <code>HX-History-Restore-Request</code> header is included so that the server
can differentiate between history requests and normal requests</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements &amp; Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of precedence of input values to favor the enclosing form (see <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/a10e43d619dc340aa324d37772c06a69a2f47ec9">here</a>)</li>
<li>Moved event filtering logic <em>after</em> <code>preventDefault</code> so filtering still allows events to be properly handled</li>
<li>No longer trigger after swap events on elements that have been removed via an <code>outerHTML</code> swap</li>
<li>Properly remove event handlers added to other elements when an element is removed from the DOM</li>
<li>Handle the <code>scroll:</code> modifier in <code>hx-swap</code> properly when an <code>outerHTML</code> swap occurs</li>
<li>Lots of docs fixes</li>
</ul>

        <p><span>M</span>any marine biologists identify a gateway drug into their obsession, and for Heather Koldewey, it was the seahorse. Who can blame her? Seahorses seem to have evolved not entirely in the ocean, but also by way of a whimsical storybook, in which animal body parts are all mixed up. A fish with the head of a horse? A male that gets pregnant, gives birth, and is monogamous?</p>

<p>Seahorses led her not only to her career as the head of marine and freshwater conservation at the London Zoological Society, but to her efforts as an activist as well. Shortly after getting her Ph.D., Koldewey co-founded <a href="https://www.projectseahorse.org/" target="_blank">Project Seahorse</a> to protect her study subject and the ocean habitats they live in.</p>
<p>Today, Koldewey amplifies both her science and her on-the-ground protection efforts in visionary and critical ways. She was instrumental in getting the Indian Oceanâ€™s Chagos Archipelago designated as a Marine Protected Area, which has helped degraded ecosystems revive and led to cross-disciplinary scientific breakthroughs. She helped forge the pioneering partnership <a href="https://net-works.com/" target="_blank">Net-works</a>, which supports local communities in the Philippines by helping them transform abandoned fishing nets into carpeting. Koldewey is helping make biodiversity protection a profitable business—and saving species as she goes.</p>

<p><strong>How did seahorses get you into conservation?</strong></p>
<p>I did my Ph.D. research in genetics. The whole field of molecular genetics was just starting to reveal you could identify different populations of species and where they came from by genetic markers. Amanda Vincent and I realized we could use genetics to combat the global market in seahorse trade. [More than 37 million seahorses a year are marketed for traditional medicinal use, aquariums, and souvenirs, and as a result they are threatened with extinction.] We could trace where the seahorses came from and target protection efforts to those areas. Amanda and I started Project Seahorse together, using this charismatic species to tackle big ocean issues. Sheâ€™s become the director as Iâ€™ve concentrated on other things. I stay involved and care deeply about that work.</p>
<p><strong>What did molecular genetics tell you about seahorses?</strong></p>
<p>Seahorses are rubbish at swimming, and they have home ranges. They are very immobile. You would expect that they would be highly structured, meaning that in a particular place you would find a particular species. It turns out thatâ€™s not usually the case. Even when seahorses are morphologically distinct (and donâ€™t look alike), they turn out to be closely related. Yet they are found in so many places around the globe. How can that be? They hitch a ride on whateverâ€™s passing by and move vast distances.</p>
<blockquote>When biologists and physicists&nbsp;get to put their heads together, we learn new things.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Seahorses are equally ubiquitous and threatened.</strong></p>
<p>I have a quest for solutions in the science. How do you solve problems seahorses are facing? One approach is captive breeding programs in zoos to address the aquarium trade, and there has been major progress. But of course seahorses and all the species with which they coexist have to be protected where they live. Over-harvesting of fish and incredibly destructive bottom-trawling are decimating the oceans. Industrial fishing is a huge problem. Another is the relentless pressure on coastal communities that depend on fishing for survival.</p>
<p><strong>You were instrumental in helping secure the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean as one of the largest Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the world. How can limiting human impacts on such a remote place benefit ocean health?</strong></p>
<p>Getting protection in the Indian Ocean is hard won and challenging. Some areas are so over-harvested they are ocean deserts. In 2009, a group of organizations, including mine, compiled the scientific evidence to help support protection around this archipelago, which is part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. In 2010, the Bertarelli Foundation, which has helped protect more than 2 million kilometers of marine areas over the past 20 years, helped the British government to establish what was then the worldâ€™s largest no-take MPA.</p>
<p>The Chagos Archipelago is made up of 58 tiny islands and contains the largest coral atoll on Earth. Here marine life is abundant and diverse, representing a glimpse of what our oceans should look like. Although still affected, protected areas show resilience to climate change. We have research dating back 50 years that gives us valuable insights from this unique location.</p>
<p><strong>This work is about protection, but it has also yielded new insights into how the ocean functions. How?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve known for a relatively long time that MPAs benefit reef-dwelling species, but havenâ€™t had as much information about how they influence the world of the ocean around them—migratory species, for example, and pelagic (open ocean) species. We have more than 70 scientists from disciplines including physics, genetics, and biology all working in this one place, which has yielded fantastic new insights. For example, a manta scientist watching mantas feeding noticed that they suddenly seemed to disappear. He couldnâ€™t figure it out. What made them suddenly move? The physicist who was monitoring the underwater currents at the time was able to say, â€œoh, itâ€™s the internal waves switching; takes their food right away.â€�</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that biologists and physicists donâ€™t often get to put their heads together, but when they do, we learn new things.</p>
<blockquote>Ocean health is key to supporting human life.</blockquote>
<p><strong>What about the islands themselves, the terrestrial ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve also learned quite a lot in the Chagos Archipelago about how the terrestrial health of the islands impacts the water. Some islands are invaded with rats, which decimate native species and decrease overall biomass. Rats eat eggs and chicks. The islands that donâ€™t have rats support more seabirds. There is a more robust nutrient flow between the water and the land, thanks to the seabirds, increasing the fish biomass off these healthy islands. These islands also seem to be more resilient to coral bleaching events.</p>
<p><strong>Everything is connected. Including people and wildlife.</strong></p>
<p>That idea is at the foundation of Net-Works. As you know, plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge and growing crisis. In addition to plastic bottles everywhere, discarded fishing nets are a terrible issue. In local communities that depend on fishing for survival, the more depleted the fish in their waters, the more nets they use—and eventually abandon when they are beyond repair. Net-Works has set up a supply-chain in the Philippines in which local people are paid to collect discarded nets, bale them, and ship them out to be recycled into nylon threads that are subsequently woven into carpeting. Weâ€™ve collected enough nets thus far to wrap more than five times around the circumference of the globe. This project is not only helping to clean up the ocean, it is providing a revenue alternative to people who are unfairly exploited in the global fishing industry.</p>
<p>Net-Works has been so successful a project within the Zoological Society of London (where Heather works) that it has spun out into an independent social enterprise called <a href="https://coast4c.com/" target="_blank">Coast 4C</a>. 4C stands for â€œcommunity, commerce, conservation, climate,â€� because they are all interconnected. This model has diversified from nets to include seaweed farming in the Philippines. Carrageenan extracted from seaweed is used in products all over the world, but like so many other supply chains, this one has been unfair to local communities. Coast 4C is putting together a model in which the people who live on the water and farm the seaweed will benefit from the supply chain and increase marine protection.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry for this inevitable pun, but there seems to be a sea-change in conservation underway.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Conservation has largely depended on foundation money, grants, and funds from the government. But these are not always sustainable over time. How can we finance conservation for the long term? We are starting to see more and more initiatives that facilitate social and impact investment into conservation. We are seeing new players in the world of conservation—corporate finance people, insurance executives. Itâ€™s not just biologists and shouldnâ€™t be—everyone can be a conservationist.</p>
<p><strong>In 2018 the United Nations reported 4.6 million fishing vessels in operation, harvesting two-thirds of fishing stocks to capacity and one-third at biologically unsustainable levels. Are you worried about ocean degradation?</strong></p>
<p>To say nothing of climate change, pollution, and acidification. Ocean health is key to supporting human life. For one thing, the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces the air we breathe. More than 3 billion people rely directly on marine and coastal biodiversity to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You look at the statistics, where we are headed, and itâ€™s scary, daunting. I focus on what I can do and form collaborations with very good people. Lots of people have part of the answer but not the whole thing. Together, we can build that jigsaw puzzle and make a difference.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the second in a three-part series about
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>.
In the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">first post</a>, I
described the context around Cranelift and our project to replace its
backend code-generation infrastructure, and detailed the
instruction-selection problem and how we solve it. The remaining two
posts will be deep-dives into some interesting engineering problems.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to dive into the <em>compiler performance</em> aspect of
our work more deeply. (In the next post we’ll explore correctness.)
There are many interesting aspects of compilation speed I could talk
about, but one particularly difficult problem is the handling of
<em>control flow</em>: how do we translate structured control flow at the
Wasm level into control-flow graphs at the IR level, and finally to
branches in a linear stream of instructions at the machine-code level?</p>

<p>Doing this translation efficiently requires careful attention to the
overall pass structure, with the largest wins coming when one can
completely eliminate a category of work. We’ll see this in how we
combine several passes in a traditional lowering design (critical-edge
splitting, block ordering, redundant-block elimination, branch
relaxation, branch target resolution) into <em>inline transforms</em> that
happen during other passes (lowering of the CLIF, or Cranelift IR,
into machine-specific IR; and later, binary emission).</p>

<p>This post basically describes the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/buffer.rs"><code>MachBuffer</code></a>,
a “smart machine-code buffer” that knows about branches and edits them
on-the-fly as we emit them, and the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/blockorder.rs"><code>BlockLoweringOrder</code></a>,
which allows us to lower code in final basic-block order, with split
critical edges inserted implicitly, by traversing a never-materialized
implicit graph. The work was done mostly in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1718">Cranelift PR
#1718</a>, which
resulted in a ~10% compile-time improvement and a ~25%
compile+run-time improvement on a CPU-intensive benchmark (<code>bz2</code>).</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-graphs">Control-Flow Graphs</h2>

<p>Before we discuss any of that, we need to review control-flow graphs
(CFGs)! The CFG is a fundamental data structure used in almost all
modern compilers. In brief, it represents how execution (i.e., program
control) may flow through instructions, using graph nodes to represent
linear sequences of instructions and graph edges to represent all
possible control-flow transfers at branch instructions.</p>

<p>At the end of the instruction selection process, which we learned
about in the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">previous post</a>, we have a function body lowered into VCode that consists of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"><em>basic blocks</em></a>. A basic
block is a contiguous sequence of instructions that has no outbound
branches except at the end, and has no inbound branches except at the
beginning. In other words, it is “straight-line” code: execution
always starts at the top and proceeds to the end. An example
control-flow graph (CFG) consisting of four basic blocks is shown
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-10-08-cfg-web.svg" alt="Figure: Control-flow graph with four basic blocks in a diamond"></p>

<p>Control-flow graphs are excellent data structures for compilers to
use. By making the flow of execution explicit as graph edges, rather
than reasoning about instructions in order in memory as the processor
sees them, many analyses can be performed more easily. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow analysis</a>
problems can be solved easily because the CFG makes traversal of
possible control-flow transfers easy. Graph-based representations of
the program also allow easier <em>moving and insertion of code</em>: it is
less error-prone to manipulate an explicit graph than to reason about
implicit control-flow (e.g. fallthrough from a not-taken conditional
branch). Finally, the graph representation factors out the question of
<em>block ordering</em>, which can be important for performance; we can
address this problem separately by choosing how we serialize the graph
nodes (blocks). For these reasons, most compiler IRs, including
Cranelift’s CLIF and <code>VCode</code>, are CFG-based.</p>

<p>(Historical note: control-flow graphs were invented by the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Allen">Frances Allen</a>, who
largely established the algorithmic foundations that modern compilers
use. Her paper <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp512/Lectures/Papers/1971-allen-catalog.pdf">A catalogue of optimizing
transformations</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
covers essentially all of the important optimizations used today and
is well worth a read.)</p>

<h2 id="cpus-and-branch-instructions">CPUs and Branch Instructions</h2>

<p>To represent a CFG’s end-of-block branches at the instruction level,
we can use <em>two-way branches</em>: these are instructions that branch
either to one basic-block target if some condition is true, or another
if the condition is false. (Basic blocks can also end in simple
unconditional single-target branches.) We wrote such a branch as <code>if
r0, L1, L2</code> above; this means that the block <code>L0</code> will be followed in
execution either by <code>L1</code> or <code>L2</code>, depending on the value in <code>r0</code>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="branches-with-fallthrough">Branches with Fallthrough</h3>

<p>However, CPUs rarely have such two-way branch instructions. Instead,
conditional control-flow in common ISAs is almost always provided with
a <em>conditional branch with fallthrough</em>. This is an instruction that,
if some condition is true, branches to another location; otherwise,
does nothing, and allows execution to continue sequentially. This is a
better fit for a hardware implementation for a number of reasons: it’s
easier to encode one target than two (the destination of the jump
might be quite far away for some branches, and instructions have
limited bits available), and it’s usually the case that the compiler
can place one of the successor blocks immediately afterward anyway.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t much of a problem if we just want a working compiler;
instead of a two-way branch</p>



<p>We can write a sequence of branches</p>



<p>where <code>br_if</code> branches to <code>L1</code> or falls through to the unconditional
<code>goto</code>. But this is not so efficient in many cases. Consider what
would happen if we laid out basic blocks in the order <code>L0</code>, <code>L2</code>,
<code>L1</code>, <code>L3</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      goto L2
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      goto L3
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two redundant unconditional branches (<code>goto</code> instructions),
each of which uselessly branches to the following instruction. We can
remove both of them with no ill effects, taking advantage instead of
<em>fallthrough</em>, or allowing execution to proceed directly from the end
of one block to the start of the next one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      // ** Otherwise, fall through to L2 **
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      // ** Always fall through to L3 **
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems like an easy enough problem to solve: we just need to
recognize when a branch is redundant and remove it, right? Well, yes,
but we can do much better than that in some cases; we’ll dig into this
problem in significantly more depth below!</p>

<h3 id="machine-code-encoding-branch-offsets">Machine-code Encoding: Branch Offsets</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve written our machine instructions in a way that humans
can read, using <em>labels</em> to refer to locations in the instruction
stream. At the hardware level, however, these labels do not exist;
instead, the machine code branches contain target <em>addresses</em> (usually
encoded as relative <em>offsets</em> from the branch instruction). In other
words, we do not see <code>goto L3</code>, but rather <code>goto +32</code>.</p>

<p>This gives rise to several complications when emitting machine code
from a list of instruction <code>struct</code>s.  At the most basic level, we
have to resolve labels to offsets and then patch the branches
appropriately. This is analogous to (but at a lower level than) the
job of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a>:
we resolve symbols to concrete values after deciding placement, and
then edit the code according to <em>relocations</em> to refer to those
symbols. In other words, whenever we emit a branch, we make a note (a
relocation, or “label use” in our <code>MachBackend</code>) to go back later and
patch it with the resolved label offset.</p>

<p>The second, and more interesting, problem arises because not all
branch instructions can necessarily refer to all possible labels! As a
concrete example, on AArch64, conditional branches have a ±1 MB range,
and unconditional branches have a ±128 MB range. This arises out of
instruction-encoding considerations: particularly in
fixed-instruction-size ISAs (such as ARM, MIPS, and RISC V), less than
a full machine word of bits are available for the immediate jump
offset that is embedded in the instruction word. (The instruction
itself is always a machine-word wide, and we need some bits for the
opcode and condition code too!) On x86, we have limits for a different
reason: the variable-width encoding allows either a one-byte offset
(allowing a ±128 byte range) or four-byte offset (allowing a ±2 GB
range).</p>

<p>To make a branch to a far-off label, then, on some machines we need to
either use a different sort of branch than the default choice for the
instruction selector, or we need to use a form of <em>indirection</em>, by
targetting the original branch to <em>another branch</em>, the latter in a
special form. The former is tricky because we do not know whether a
target will be in-range until all code is lowered and placement is
computed; so we need to either optimistically or pessimistically lower
branches to the shortest or longest form (respectively) and possibly
switch later. To make matters worse, as we edit branches to use a
shorter or longer form, their length may change, moving <em>other</em>
targets into or out of range; in the most general solution, this is a
“fixpoint problem”, where we iterate until no more changes occur.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-lowering-cfgs-to-machine-code">Challenges in Lowering CFGs to Machine Code</h2>

<p>So far, we have a way to produce <em>correct</em> machine code. To emit the
final code for a two-target branch, we can emit a conditional-
followed by unconditional-branch machine instruction. To resolve
branch targets correctly, we can assume that any target could be
anywhere in memory, and always use the long form of a branch; then we
just need to come back in one final pass and fill in the offsets when
we know them.</p>

<p>We can do much better than this, though! Below I’ll describe four
problems and the ways that they are traditionally solved.</p>

blocks will appear in the final binary. In …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Hello! This article took a while to cobble together. If you find it useful, please consider leaving a donation via <a href="https://donorbox.org/crdt-article"> </a>, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/archagon"> </a>, or <a href="ethereum:0x0d5dd8a8Cca8Bf7d0122F7A1Cc76c6b0666fCC56"> </a>. (Thought I'd try something new!) Or, just buy yourself a nice Roost through my <a href="http://amzn.to/2D7uYxz"> </a>. Donation or not, thank you for reading! 😊</p>

<p>(Sorry about the length! At some point in the distant past, this was supposed to be a short blog post. If you like, you can skip straight to the <a href="#demo-concurrent-editing-in-macos-and-ios">demo section</a> to get a sense of what this article is about.)</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, most of my app development to date has been confined to local devices. Programmers like to gloat about the stupendous mental castles they build of their circuitous, multi-level architectures, but not me. In truth, networks leave me quite perplexed. I start thinking about data serializing to bits, servers performing their arcane handshakes and voting rituals, merge conflicts pushing into app-space and starting the whole process over again—and it all just turns to mush in my head. For peace of mind, my code needs to be <em>locally provable</em>, and this means things like idempotent functions, decoupled modules, contiguous data structures, immutable objects. Networks, unfortunately, throw a giant wrench in the works.</p>

<p>Sometime last year, after realizing that most of my document-based apps would probably need to support sync and collaboration in the future, I decided to finally take a stab at the problem. Granted, there were tons of frameworks that promised to do the hard work of data model replication for me, but I didn’t want to black-box the most important part of my code. My gut told me that there had to be some arcane bit of foundational knowledge that would allow me to sync my documents in a refined and functional way, decoupled from the stateful spaghetti of the underlying network layer. Instead of downloading a Github framework and <a href="http://amzn.to/2iigBOI">smacking the build button</a>, I wanted to develop a base set of skills that would allow me to easily network <em>any</em> document-based app in the future, even if I was starting from scratch.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The first order of business was to devise a wishlist for my fantastical system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most obviously, users should be able to edit their documents immediately, without even touching the network. (In other words, the system should only require <em>optimistic concurrency</em>.)</li>
  <li>Sync should happen in the background, entirely separate from the main application code, and any remote changes should be seamlessly integrated in real-time. (The user shouldn’t have to notice that the network is down.)</li>
  <li>Merge should always be automatic, even for concurrent edits. The user should never be faced with a “pick the correct revision” dialog box.</li>
  <li>A user should be able to work on their document offline for an indefinite period of time without accruing “sync debt”. (Meaning that if, for example, sync is accomplished by sending out mutation events, performance should not suffer even if the user spends a month offline and then sends all their hundreds of changes at once.)</li>
  <li>Secondary data structures and state should be minimized. Most of the extra information required for sync should be stored in the same place as the document, and moving the document to a new device should not break sync. (No out-of-band metadata or caches!)</li>
  <li>Network back-and-forth should be condensed to a bare minimum, and rollbacks and re-syncs should practically never happen. To the greatest possible degree, network communication should be stateless and dumb.</li>
  <li>To top it all off, my chosen technique had to pass the “PhD Test”. That is to say, one shouldn’t need a PhD to understand and implement the chosen approach for custom data models!</li>
</ul>

<p>After mulling over my bullet points, it occurred to me that the network problems I was dealing with—background cloud sync, editing across multiple devices, real-time collaboration, offline support, and reconciliation of distant or conflicting revisions—were all pointing to the same question: was it possible to design a system where any two revisions of the same document could be merged deterministically and sensibly without requiring user intervention? Sync, per se, wasn’t the issue, since getting data from one device to another was essentially a solved problem. It’s what happened <em>after</em> sync that was troubling. On encountering a merge conflict, you’d be thrown into a busy conversation between the network, model, persistence, and UI layers just to get back into a consistent state. The data couldn’t be left alone to live its peaceful, functional life: every concurrent edit immediately became a cross-architectural matter. On the other hand, if two documents could always be made to merge, then most of that coordination hullabaloo could go out the window. Each part of the system could be made to work at its own pace.</p>

<p>Whether stored as a record in a database or as a stand-alone file, a document could be interpreted as a collection of basic data fields: registers, sequences, dictionaries, and so forth. Looking at the problem from a database perspective, it was actually quite simple to automatically resolve merge conflicts in this kind of table row: just keep overwriting each field with the version sporting the highest timestamp, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps">logical</a> or otherwise. (Ignoring issues of inter-field consistency for now.) Of course, for anything other than basic registers, this was a terrible approach. Sequences and dictionaries weren’t just blobs of homogeneous data that were overwritten with every change, but complex, mutable structures that users were editing on a granular level. For such a fundamental problem, there was a surprising dearth of solutions out in the real world: most systems punted the task to app-space by asking the client to manually fix any merge conflicts or pick the correct version of a file. It seemed that if the problem of automatic merge for non-trivial data types could be solved—perhaps by exposing their local, type-specific mutation vocabulary to the storage and replication layers?—then a solution to the higher-level problem of automatic document merge would fall within reach.</p>

<p>In hope of uncovering some prior art, I started by looking at the proven leader in the field, Google Docs. Venturing down the deep rabbit hole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor">real-time collaborative editing</a> techniques, I discovered that many of the problems I faced fell under the umbrella of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">strong eventual consistency</a>. Unlike the more conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency">strong consistency</a> model, where all clients receive changes in identical order and rely on locking to some degree, strong <em>eventual</em> consistency allows clients to individually diverge and then arrive at a final, consistent result once each update has been received. (Or, in a word, when the network is <em>quiescent</em>.)</p>

<p>There were a number of tantalizing techniques to investigate, and I kept several questions in mind while doing my analysis. Could a given technique be generalized to arbitrary and novel data types? Did the technique pass the PhD Test? And was it possible to use the technique in an architecture with smart clients and dumb servers?</p>

<p>The reason for that last question was CloudKit Sharing, a framework introduced in iOS 10. For the most part, this framework functioned as a superset of regular CloudKit, requiring only minor code changes to enable document sharing in an app. A developer didn’t even have to worry about connecting users or dealing with UI: Apple did most of the hard work in the background while leveraging standard system dialogs. But almost two years later, <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Swift&amp;q=UICloudSharingController&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">on the order of no one</a> seemed to be using it. Why was this? Most other Apple APIs tended to be readily adopted, especially when they allowed the developer to expand into system areas which were normally out of bounds.</p>

<p>My hunch was that CloudKit Sharing forced the issue of real-time collaboration over a relatively dumb channel, which was a task outside the purview of conventional sync approaches. CloudKit allowed developers to easily store, retrieve, and listen for new data, but not much else besides. No third-party code was allowed to run on Apple’s servers, so merge conflicts had to be handled locally. But unlike in the single-user case, which presented limited opportunities for concurrent edits, you couldn’t just pop up a merge dialog every time another participant in your share made a change to your open document. The only remaining options seemed to be some sort of ugly, heuristic auto-merge or data-dropping last-write-wins, neither of which was acceptable for real-time use. Collaboration along the lines of Google Docs appeared to be impossible using this system! But was it really?</p>

<p>I realized that this was my prize to be won. If I could figure out a way to develop auto-merging documents, I’d be able to implement sync and collaboration in my apps over CloudKit while using Apple’s first-party sharing UI—all without having to pay for or manage my own servers. So this became my ultimate research goal: a collaborative iPhone text editing demo that synced entirely over CloudKit. (And here’s a spoiler: <a href="#demo-concurrent-editing-in-macos-and-ios">it worked!</a>)</p>





<p>There are a few basic terms critical to understanding eventual consistency. A network is comprised of <em>sites</em> (“devices”, “peers”) operating in parallel, each one producing <em>operations</em> (“events”, “actions”) that mutate the data and exchange information with other sites. The first vital concept here is <strong>causality</strong>. An operation is <em>caused</em> by another operation when it directly modifies or otherwise involves the results of that operation, and determining causality is critical to reconstructing a sensible timeline (or <strong>linearization</strong>) of operations across the network. (An operation that <em>causes</em> another operation must always be ordered first.) However, we can’t always determine direct causality in a general way, so algorithms often assume that an operation is causally ahead of another one if the site generating the newer operation has already seen the older one at the time of its creation. (In other words, every operation already seen by a site at the time a new operation is created is in that operation’s <em>caus…</em></p></article></div></div></div></div>

		<p>With the explosion of new content fuelled by the internet, for the majority of us, consumption reigns supreme. But I don't believe anybody really stops to think about why we consume the content we do and what that says about us and the content. I think generally content is interesting for one of two reasons</p><ol><li>The content itself</li><li>The creator of the content</li></ol><p>All content exists somewhere on the creator-content continuum (the Triple C).</p><p>To figure out where a piece of content fits it's helpful to define the edges. Amazingly enough Reality TV sits at both extremes of the Triple C.</p><p>The early forms of RTV sit at the pure content side. Think Survivor, Big Brother and The Real World. Literally, random people off the street put into absurd situations for the enjoyment of audiences at home. Do you know who the producers, writers were for those shows? Did anybody know who the contestants were on the show before they started? The only thing interesting about the shows was the misery and drama provided - at least before RTV 'stars' started becoming celebrities in their own right. Pure content.</p><p>The more modern forms of RTV are however pure creator. Think KUWTK and basic YouTube vloggers. Content that is only interesting to people because of who the creator is. Literally, famous people doing everyday things. Is it really that interesting watching someone talk into a camera about going shopping if you're not invested in who they are as a creator?</p><p>Okay, great. We've got the edges, but what about the holy grail. The middle where content and creator meet in a symbiotic mishmash of pure content awesomeness and creator obsession? That's what I call the Dave Chappelle Divide (previously known as the Beatle Bump). What's the DCD? The DCD is where content is interesting in equal parts because of the content itself and because of who the creator is. I could watch Dave Chappelle sitting, smoking a cigarette and ranting about the world for hours.<sup>1</sup> Is that because his routine is insanely interesting or is it because he’s Dave Chappelle? For me, both. I believe the content could stand on its own but coming from Dave Chappelle enhances its character. I call it the Content Creator Compound Effect.</p><p>Why is getting to the DCD and creating a CCCE important? Because there's this curious moment where the enjoyment and value one derives from content is actually enhanced by your investment in the creator. The example I would use here is Khan Academy. It started off on the pure content side of the Triple C. It stands on its own. It is highly informative and has been useful to millions of students around the world before anyone knew who Sal Khan was. As Sal has grown in fame and importance Khan Academy have tried having other people make videos but for some reason they don’t quite hit the same way. The same content with a different creator is not as good. In fact I would argue his increasing fame has made Khan Academy even more useful.<sup>2</sup> So does that mean we should find the best content we can, propel those creators to fame so that we are able to enjoy and derive even more value from their content? Maybe.</p><p>One interesting aspect of this continuum is that the better a creator is at creating content the more and more their future content can fall into the trap of being interesting only because of the creator themselves. Looking historically it appears incredibly hard to straddle the Dave Chappelle Divide. The issue here is fame seems to be a powerful drug. And once a creator reaches some threshold where no matter the quality of their content there is a base level of interest in it, often the content seems to suffer. Why is it that most bands' best work is their first album? Why do so many famous Mathematicians make the breakthrough that they're known for in their 20s? It is said that TV dulls the mind, perhaps fame is the true dullant.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Let's take a step back to explore other forms of content and try to place them on the Triple C to see what that says about that content, those creators, ourselves and how we should actually consume them.</p><p>Startup, financial and business advice often, I would argue, sits on the creator side of the Triple C. Most advice of this type suffers from some combination of generic platitude, survivorship bias or any of the other many smart sounding accusations thrown around on Hacker News. When we consume content that we are meant to learn from and apply in our own lives we really need to be wary of content that is interesting only because of its creator. Because if this content is meant to be informative but it is only interesting because of the creator then you're in trouble. How useful, really, is advice from Elon Musk? Most of us are not in his shoes, we don't have access to his connections and opportunity. When he was in our shoes some 25 years ago at this point the world was a much different place. But millions flock to listen to what he has to say. Of course the question is, is this even wrong? Why should the same content from Elon Musk not be more interesting and given more credence than if it were provided to us by an anonymous person on Reddit? You have to ask yourself, is this creator interesting because of previous content they’ve created<sup> 4</sup> in this field? Elon Musk probably doesn’t have that many interesting or worthwhile things to say about yodeling.<sup>5</sup> Even if the creator is within their sphere of competence you still need to evaluate the content for itself. If you don't, all the content is good for is entertainment. If it is just entertainment you’re seeking, that, is totally fine. I am a huge fan of entrepreneurship porn but you should be honest with yourself and not be tricked into thinking you're doing something productive. So what, are we supposed to ignore all startup advice? Well no, but you should stop to think a little more, is this within their sphere of competence? Is this only interesting because of the creator or is there some merit to the content? Well how am I supposed to know if there’s merit to the content, that’s the whole reason I’m seeking the content from this creator? Uhh 😬, good question. Let me get back to you on that one.</p><p>Clubhouse is interesting - watching rooms fluctuate in size when a well known person joins highlights the incredible power of the creator. Their mere presence increases how interesting the content in the room appears and often is. But, I've also been involved in the complete opposite rooms where nobody says anything interesting and I get to the end of the hour and realise I've listened to an hour of people introducing themselves and trying to sound important, get more followers without saying anything actually worth listening to. To be fair I don't blame them, making good content is hard and it also isn't enough, you need to promote it too, but it is hard not to feel a little cheated when you sit through the promotion but the worthwhile content never materialises.</p><p>So, where does this yarn sit? If you think this yarn is in any way interesting and you’re reading this in 2021 then it’s purely content based because nobody knows who I am. But if for some inexplicable reason I was to gain some form of notability and you are reading this in 2031 it could theoretically be true that this formation of words is only interesting to you because I’m the creator. The bizarre case of the wandering content.</p><p>I'm interested to hear where other people would place the content I've discussed and other forms of content on the Triple C. </p>

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5a323f3636351a3f223b372a363f74393537">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>Biologically Plausible Deep Learning (BPDL) is an active research field at the intersection of Neuroscience and Machine Learning, studying how we can train deep neural networks with a "learning rule" that could conceivably be implemented in the brain.</p><p>The line of reasoning that typically motivates BPDL is as follows:</p><ol><li>A Deep Neural Network (DNN) can learn to&nbsp;perform perception tasks that biological brains are capable of (such as detecting and recognizing objects).</li><li>If activation units and their weights are to DNNs as&nbsp;what neurons and synapses are to biological brains, then what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backprop </a>(the primary method for training deep neural nets) analogous to?</li><li>If learning rules in brains are not implemented using backprop, then how are they implemented? How can we achieve similar performance to backprop-based update rules while still respecting biological constraints?</li></ol><p>A nice overview of the ways in which backprop is not biologically plausible can be found <a href="https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16269/is-back-prop-biologically-plausible">here</a>, along with various algorithms that propose fixes.</p><p>My somewhat contrarian opinion is that designing biologically plausible alternatives to backprop is the wrong question to be asking. The motivating premises of BPDL makes a faulty assumption: that <b>layer activations are neurons and weights are synapses, and therefore learning-via-backprop must have a counterpart or alternative in biological learning.</b></p><p>Despite the name and their impressive capabilities on various tasks, DNNs actually have very little to do with biological neural networks. One of the great errors in the field of Machine Learning is that we ascribe too much biological&nbsp; meaning to our statistical tools and optimal control algorithms. It leads to confusion from newcomers, who ascribe entirely different meaning to "learning", "evolutionary algorithms", and so on.</p><p>DNNs are a sequence of linear operations interspersed with nonlinear operations, applied sequentially to real-valued inputs - nothing more. They are optimized via gradient descent, and gradients are computed efficiently using a dynamic programming scheme known as backprop. Note that I didn't use the word "learning"!</p><p>Dynamic programming is the ninth wonder of the world<span>1</span>, and in my opinion one of the top three achievements of Computer Science. Backprop has linear time-complexity in network depth, which makes it extraordinarily hard to beat from a computational cost perspective. Many BPDL algorithms often don't do better than backprop, because they try to take an efficient optimization scheme and shoehorn in an update mechanism with additional constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>If the goal is to build a biologically plausible learning mechanism, there's no reason that units in Deep Neural Networks should be one-to-one with biological neurons. Trying to emulate a DNN with models of biologically neurons feels backwards; like trying to emulate the Windows OS with a human brain. It's hard and a human brain can't simulate Windows well.</p><p>Instead, let's do the emulation the other way around: optimizing a function approximator to&nbsp;implement a biologically plausible learning rule. The recipe is straightforward:</p><ol><li>Build a biological plausible model of a neural network with model neurons and synaptic connections. Neurons communicate with each other using spike trains, rate coding, or gradients, and respect whatever constraints you deem to be "sufficiently biologically plausible". It has parameters that need to be trained.</li><li>Use computer-aided search to design a biologically plausible learning rule for these model neurons. For instance, each neuron's feedforward behavior and local update rules can be modeled as a decision from an artificial neural network.</li><li>Update the function approximator so that the biological model produces the desired learning behavior. We could train the neural networks via backprop.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The choice of function approximator we use to find our learning rule is irrelevant - what we care about at the end of the day is answering how a biological brain is able to learn hard tasks like perception, while respecting known constraints like the fact that biological neurons don't store all activations in memory or only employ local learning rules. We should leverage Deep Learning's ability to find good function approximators, and direct that towards finding a good biological learning rules.</p><p>The insight that we should&nbsp;<i>(artificially)&nbsp;learn to (biologically) learn</i>&nbsp;is not a new idea, but it is one that I think is not yet obvious to the neuroscience + AI community. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science)">Meta-Learning</a>, or "Learning to Learn",&nbsp;is a field that has emerged in recent years, which formulates the act of acquiring a system capable of performing learning behavior (potentially superior to gradient descent). If meta-learning can find us more <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05175.pdf">sample efficient</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07392">superior</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03367.pdf">robust</a>&nbsp;learners, why can't it find us rules that respect biological learning constraints? Indeed, recent work [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09549.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.891184v1.full.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03837.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/real20a/real20a.pdf">5</a>] shows this to be the case. You can indeed use backprop to train a separate learning rule superior to naïve backprop.</p><p>I think the reason that many researchers have not really caught onto this idea (that we should emulate biologically plausible circuits with a meta-learning approach) is that until recently, compute power wasn't quite strong enough to both train a meta-learner and a learner. It still requires substantial computing power and research infrastructure to set up a meta-optimization scheme, but tools like <a href="https://blog.evjang.com/2019/02/maml-jax.html">JAX make it considerably easier now</a>.</p><p>A true biology purist might argue that finding a learning rule using gradient descent and backprop is not an "evolutionarily plausible learning rule", because evolution clearly lacks the ability to perform dynamic programming or even gradient computation. But this can be amended by making the meta-learner evolutionarily plausible. For instance, the mechanism with which we select good function approximators does not need rely on backprop at all. Alternatively, we could formulate a meta-meta problem whereby the selection process itself obeys rules of evolutionary selection, but the selection process is found using, once again, backprop.</p><p>Don't mess with backprop!</p><p><b>Footnotes</b></p><p>[1] The eighth wonder being, of course, <a href="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/compound-interest/">compound interest</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" aria-label="tldr permalink"></a></h2>
<p>In this article I’m trying to explain the difference/similarities between dynamic programing and divide and conquer approaches based on two examples: <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/search/binary-search">binary search</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/string/levenshtein-distance">minimum edit distance</a> (Levenshtein distance).</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a href="#the-problem" aria-label="the problem permalink"></a></h2>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms">started to learn algorithms</a> it was hard for me to understand the main idea of dynamic programming (<strong>DP</strong>) and how it is different from divide-and-conquer (<strong>DC</strong>) approach. When it gets to comparing those two paradigms usually Fibonacci function comes to the rescue as great <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13538459/difference-between-divide-and-conquer-algo-and-dynamic-programming">example</a>. But when we’re trying to solve the <strong>same</strong> problem using both DP and DC approaches to explain each of them, it feels for me like we may <strong>lose valuable detail</strong> that might help to catch the difference faster. These detail tells us that each technique serves best for <strong>different</strong> types of problems.</p>
<p>I’m still in the process of understanding DP and DC difference, and I can’t say that I’ve fully grasped the concepts so far. But I hope this article will shed some extra light and help you to do another step of learning such valuable algorithm paradigms as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-and-divide-and-conquer-similarities">Dynamic Programming and Divide-and-Conquer Similarities<a href="#dynamic-programming-and-divide-and-conquer-similarities" aria-label="dynamic programming and divide and conquer similarities permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As I see it for now I can say that <strong>dynamic programming is an extension of the divide and conquer paradigm</strong>.</p>
<p>I would <strong>not</strong> treat them as something completely different. Because <strong>they both work by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems</strong> of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.</p>
<p>So why do we still have different paradigm names then and why I called dynamic programming an extension. It is because dynamic programming approach may be applied to the problem <strong>only if the problem has certain restrictions or prerequisites</strong>. After that dynamic programming extends divide and conquer approach with <strong>memoization</strong> or <strong>tabulation</strong> technique.</p>
<p>Let’s go step by step...</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-prerequisitesrestrictions">Dynamic Programming Prerequisites/Restrictions<a href="#dynamic-programming-prerequisitesrestrictions" aria-label="dynamic programming prerequisitesrestrictions permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As we’ve just discovered there are two key attributes that divide and conquer problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">Optimal substructure</a> - optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblems">Overlapping sub-problems</a> - problem can be broken down into sub-problems which are reused several times, or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same sub-problem over and over rather than always generating new sub-problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these two conditions are met we can say that this divide and conquer problem may be solved using dynamic programming approach.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-programming-extension-for-divide-and-conquer">Dynamic Programming Extension for Divide and Conquer<a href="#dynamic-programming-extension-for-divide-and-conquer" aria-label="dynamic programming extension for divide and conquer permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Dynamic programming approach extends divide and conquer approach with two techniques (<strong>memoization</strong> and <strong>tabulation</strong>) that both have a purpose of storing and re-using sub-problems solutions that may drastically improve performance. For example naive recursive implementation of Fibonacci function has time complexity of <code>O(2^n)</code> where DP solution doing the same with only <code>O(n)</code> time.</p>
<p><strong>Memoization (top-down cache filling)</strong> refers to the technique of caching and reusing previously computed results. The memoized <code>fib</code> function would thus look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>memFib(n) {
    if (mem[n] is undefined)
        if (n &lt; 2) result = n
        else result = memFib(n-2) + memFib(n-1)
        mem[n] = result
    return mem[n]
}</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Tabulation (bottom-up cache filling)</strong> is similar but focuses on filling the entries of the cache. Computing the values in the cache is easiest done iteratively. The tabulation version of <code>fib</code> would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>tabFib(n) {
    mem[0] = 0
    mem[1] = 1
    for i = 2...n
        mem[i] = mem[i-2] + mem[i-1]
    return mem[n]
}</code></pre></div>
<p>You may read more about memoization and tabulation comparison <a href="https://programming.guide/dynamic-programming-vs-memoization-vs-tabulation.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea you should grasp here is that because our divide and conquer problem has overlapping sub-problems the caching of sub-problem solutions becomes possible and thus memoization/tabulation step up onto the scene.</p>

<p>Since we’re now familiar with DP prerequisites and its methodologies we’re ready to put all that was mentioned above into one picture.</p>

<p>Let’s go and try to solve some problems using DP and DC approaches to make this illustration more clear.</p>
<h2 id="divide-and-conquer-example-binary-search">Divide and Conquer Example: Binary Search<a href="#divide-and-conquer-example-binary-search" aria-label="divide and conquer example binary search permalink"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Binary search</a> algorithm, also known as half-interval search, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.</p>

<p>You may clearly see here a divide and conquer principle of solving the problem. We’re iteratively breaking the original array into sub-arrays and trying to find required element in there.</p>
<p>Can we apply dynamic programming to it? <strong>No</strong>. It is because <strong>there are no overlapping sub-problems</strong>. Every time we split the array into completely independent parts. And according to divide and conquer prerequisites/restrictions the sub-problems <strong>must be</strong> overlapped somehow.</p>
<p>Normally every time you draw a decision tree and it is actually a <strong>tree</strong> (and <strong>not</strong> a decision <strong>graph</strong>) it would mean that you don’t have overlapping sub-problems and this is not dynamic programming problem.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-programming-example-minimum-edit-distance">Dynamic Programming Example: Minimum Edit Distance<a href="#dynamic-programming-example-minimum-edit-distance" aria-label="dynamic programming example minimum edit distance permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Normally when it comes to dynamic programming examples the <a href="https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/math/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> number algorithm is being taken by default. But let’s take a little bit more complex algorithm to have some kind of variety that should help us to grasp the concept.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Minimum Edit Distance</a> (or Levenshtein Distance) is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (<em>insertions, deletions or substitutions</em>) required to change one word into the other.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example<a href="#example-1" aria-label="example 1 permalink"></a></h3>
<p>For example, the Levenshtein distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>k</strong>itten → <strong>s</strong>itten (substitution of “s” for “k”)</li>
<li>sitt<strong>e</strong>n → sitt<strong>i</strong>n (substitution of “i” for “e”)</li>
<li>sittin → sittin<strong>g</strong> (insertion of “g” at the end).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications">Applications<a href="#applications" aria-label="applications permalink"></a></h3>
<p>This has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition, fuzzy string searching, and software to assist natural language translation based on translation memory.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-definition">Mathematical Definition<a href="#mathematical-definition" aria-label="mathematical definition permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> (of length <code>|a|</code> and <code>|b|</code> respectively) is given by function <code>lev(|a|, |b|)</code> where:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to <strong>deletion</strong> (from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>), the second to <strong>insertion</strong> and the third to <strong>match or mismatch</strong>, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.</p>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation<a href="#explanation" aria-label="explanation permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Ok, let’s try to figure out what that formula is talking about. Let’s take a simple example of finding minimum edit distance between strings <strong>ME</strong> and <strong>MY</strong>. Intuitively you already know that minimum edit distance here is <strong>1</strong> operation and this operation is *“replace <strong>E</strong> with <strong>Y</strong>”*. But let’s try to formalize it in a form of the algorithm in order to be able to do more complex examples like transforming <strong>Saturday</strong> into <strong>Sunday</strong>.</p>
<p>To apply the formula to M<strong>E</strong>→M<strong>Y</strong> transformation we need to know minimum edit distances of ME→M, M→MY and M→M transformations in prior. Then we will need to pick the minimum one and add +1 operation to transform last letters E→Y.</p>
<p>So we can already see here a recursive nature of the solution: minimum edit distance of ME→MY transformation is being calculated based on three previously possible transformations. Thus we may say that this is <strong>divide and conquer algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>To explain this further let’s draw the following matrix.</p>
<p><span>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cell (0,1)</strong> contains red number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform <strong>M</strong> to <strong>empty string</strong>: delete <strong>M</strong>. This is why this number is red.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (0,2)</strong> contains red number 2. It means that we need 2 operations to transform <strong>ME</strong> to <strong>empty string</strong>: delete <strong>E</strong>, delete <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,0)</strong> contains green number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform empty string to <strong>M</strong>: insert <strong>M</strong>. This is why this number is green.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (2,0)</strong> contains green number 2. It means that we need 2 operations to transform empty string to <strong>MY</strong>: insert <strong>Y</strong>, insert <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,1)</strong> contains number 0. It means that it costs nothing to transform <strong>M</strong> to <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cell (1,2)</strong> contains red number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform <strong>ME</strong> to <strong>M</strong>: delete <strong>E</strong>.</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks easy for such small matrix as ours (it is only 3x3). But how we could calculate all those numbers for bigger matrices (let’s say 9x7 one, for Saturday→Sunday transformation)?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f86427c789d3ed88f9e78be8d68f2d4f1ddcfbda/e4855/p/clubhouse-fun/clubhouse-agora-zerforschung-meme.jpg" alt="Coverimage"></p><h2 id="what-happened-so-far-">What happened so far …</h2><p>In our first <a href="https://zerforschung.org/posts/gespraeche-aus-dem-clubhouse/">thread on Clubhouse (in german)</a> we had only taken a superficial look at Clubhouse.</p><p>We saw that Clubhouse uses an external service provider called Agora.io for the voice call functionality.
Agora.io is also used by many other apps, including a therapy app.
In the thread we found that, among other things, we can easily listen to a room without being displayed to the other room participants if we communicate directly with Agora.</p><p>Conversely, you can also be displayed in a room without listening. However, this is not really a problem - after all, even outside Clubhouse you are often present in conversations without really listening.</p><h2 id="-and-what-happened-next-">… and what happened next …</h2><p>After we published <a href="https://twitter.com/zerforschung/status/1354218368782508037">the Twitter thread</a>, we tried to play sound directly through Agora.
This still worked after we left the room - we could still participate in conversations.</p><video controls="">
<source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87d9be48b5f4f855673557bd2268476398ece4b3/461a7/m/clubhouse-fun/leave-room.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4564cee5098f5e5234844c16aec2dc45977a4e00/363c4/m/clubhouse-fun/leave-room.webm" type="video/webm"></video><p>Of course, we only tested the whole thing in private rooms so as not to disturb anyone.
The standard behaviour of Clubhouse in private rooms is that all participants are allowed to speak.
Clubhouse also has the feature of a virtual stage, especially for larger, public rooms.
Only those who have been brought onto this stage can speak audibly for the whole room, the rest remain in the virtual audience and can only listen.
After our previous experience, we suspected something bad, so we moved our test account to the Audience.
As expected, everyone in the room was immediately informed that the account could no longer speak and was now in the audience.
However, this account could continue to play sound without any problems, which could be heard throughout the room.</p><video controls="">
<source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b35bc8c3ac3e24ff95ec32e6017d65e218a74f3e/73335/m/clubhouse-fun/move-audience.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9cec51ef49da99794acc961a9cdb172d61110a7e/2b71f/m/clubhouse-fun/move-audience.webm" type="video/webm"></video><p>Again, the behaviour can be combined with the original discovery - the account can leave the room and then not only continue to listen, but also play sound that is transmitted to everyone in the room.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: In public rooms, we must have been on stage at least once to speak. After that, however, no one can take away our permission to speak.
You can also activate the virtual stage in private rooms. We can always speak there, even if we had only been in the audience since joining the room.</p><hr><p>Unfortunately, the only feature of Clubhouse that a room moderator could use to prevent unwanted participants (and their audio) is also broken: the eject button.
This “Remove from Room” button only asks the Clubhouse app of the respective user to leave the room.
If the app is modified, it can simply ignore this request and remains in the room.</p><p>If you talk directly to the audio service provider Agora, all the moderation options of the Clubhouse app have no effect. The possibility to play sound continues to work until the room is finally closed for everyone.</p><video controls="">

But first we want to give Clubhouse enough time to fix the described problems.</p><p>We have informed Clubhouse about the problems but have not received any feedback at the time of publication.</p><p>However: We have decided to publish this article anyway before fixing the problems, because in our view these problems are unfortunately (too) easy to find and can cause some damage if not known.</p><p>However, after a quick skim of the Agora interface documentation and Clubhouse’s use of it so far, we estimate that fixing the problem might be a bit more difficult after all.
But the details and a few fun things we found will follow soon, so stay tuned 🚀✨</p><div><p>All our work is done in our spare time, besides our jobs and general pandemic exhaustion.

</p>

<p>Hi! For <a href="http://sigbovik.org/2016/">SIGBOVIK 2017</a>, I created a strange <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.pdf">paper</a>. This one may be a bit impenetrable for non computer scientists. If you have the time, I think reading the paper is the best way to experience it. But I also created the following video that explains the ideas involved, for interested non-experts or patient experts. It's long, at about 25 minutes, but you can always just skip to the end:

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LA_DrBwkiJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

</p><p>The paper in raw form is available as <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.exe">PAPER.EXE</a> or <a href="http://tom7.org/abc/paper.txt">PAPER.TXT</a> (same file). Due to unreasonable SIGBOVIK deadlines, it's been updated a little compared to the version that appeared in SIGBOVIK 2017 (<a href="http://tom7.org/abc/abc.bib">bibtex</a>).

</p><p>The source code I used to create the paper is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/abc/">here</a>.</p>

  <p><span>opensource</span></p><p>21 Jul 2020</p>


<p>3 minute read</p>

<p>Open Source Software and especially large projects have a few defined standards that are used to promote welcoming new contributors and ensure a healthy collaborative environment like for example <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>, <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code>, and <a href="https://github.blog/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">issue/pull request templates</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, even in popular projects, there is a disconcerting lack of guidance on the actual structure of the software and its inner workings</p>

<p>For example, as a part of the <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/">open source Google Code-in event</a>, last winter I started contributing and still contribute to <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/">Public Lab</a>, an environmental community that develops environmental software.</p>

<p>This forum’s code base is relatively large, especially for an open source beginner. It has about ~25 controllers, ~30 models and a very complete testing suite with functional, unit and system testing all automated with Travis.</p>

<p>But I took some time and read through the code to understand how the different bits and pieces of the app interacted, and grew to a confident level with some parts and at least an abstraction of understanding with the others. I luckily also had the help of my mentors who answered my questions during this process.</p>

<p>Obviously, this mentorship is often unavailable and new contributors have to scrutinize the code base on their own, and try to come up with a vague understanding of the components that will prevent them from creating a breaking change in another part of the app.</p>

<p>For example, in other industries, usually physical blueprints serve as this stepping stone to provide an overview of how the product works as a whole and yet it’s often missing in software engineering.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example. I’ve been getting into the <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/">Crystal</a> programming language as a faster, type-checked alternative to Ruby. I really enjoyed the language and wanted to contribute and understand the code. I checked out their <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></a> and it provided me with mostly a social / collaborative overview of where I can discuss issues or ideas, where I can ask questions, etc… What it did <strong>not</strong> provide was a <strong>technical</strong> overview of how the code is structured, the way it all comes together and its tech stack.</p>

<p>Putting this information would be helpful to not put off curious contributors that want to learn and develop a higher-level understanding of how the project works.</p>

<p>These frustrations are pushing me to propose a new “standard” for welcoming open source contribution, an <code>ARCHITECTURE.md</code> file, that would work on top of <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> to inform on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech stack, the backend / frontend / db / middleware technologies used</li>
  <li>The structure of the code and its logical links (diagrams :)), for example, crystal’s code is organised with <code>/src/modulename/submodule.cr</code> structure (ie <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/src/csv/parser.cr"><code>/src/csv/parser.cr</code></a>, i.e. how does it all come together and what is the flow of the software. The <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/">C4 model for software architecture</a> provide an instruction set for how engineers can use diagrams to easily explain their architecture.</li>
  <li>Specifications for testing and general guidelines on testing constraints for said project paired with details on the CI process</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s easy for the creators of a project to represent in their minds the way all the pieces of the project come together, but transcribing these pieces together into a document would be extremely beneficial, not only to teach others but also to clarify and renew one’s own understanding of their own code base.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas for additional information it could contain, please comment! I think this could be incredibly useful in general to make access to open source projects easier and lower the learning curve.</p>

<p>As the pandemic runs its course, tracking genetic mutations has gained mainstream coverage. Officially, in the line of work we call bioinformatics, finding and understanding mutations is known as <em>Variant Calling</em>. In the same way every person is different from others (except twins), an individual virus can have variations in their genome; when a lot of these genetic variations accumulate between the virus we detected originally and what we find months later in a faraway town, we can say that we have a new <em>strain</em> of the virus. The Coronavirus which we’re now calling <em>SARS-CoV-2</em> was first detected in Wuhan中国, so the genetic sequencing data from here is used as the base reference genome, and we measure mutations for the virus detected everywhere else against this; a coronavirus genome from a few towns away might only have a couple letters of the genome different from the Wuhan data, while something that’s travelled to the other side of the world after being transmitted through many people, climates, and even treatments, might now have acquired many more genetic variants compared to the original data.</p>

When turning the molecules in genetic code into digital files these machines create strings that can be a few hundred letters in length to several thousand, but never the entire genome of the virus in a single string. A standardized file format called <em>fastq</em> holds all the strings from a single sample, including some quality data from the machine doing the sequencing. These strings are in no particular order, and first need to be mapped together to get the complete genome. Pretty much the standard way to create these genetic maps uses a technique invented in Palo Alto back in the early 90s by &nbsp;Michael Burrows and David Wheeler. The <em>Burrows–Wheeler Transform</em> was mostly just used in data compression, until around 2010 when computational biologists began to use it to align genomes together.</p>

<h4 id="table-1">Table 1.</h4>
<p><strong>SRA:</strong> <em>Sequence Read Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>ENA:</strong> <em>European Nucleotide Archive</em> <strong>-Open Access</strong></p>

<p><strong>GISAID:</strong> <em>Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data</em> <strong>-Private</strong></p>

<p>Heng Li, now a professor at Harvard (amongst other things) has created the most commonly used alignment algorithm (amongst other things) with <a href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">BWA</a>. This algorithm is super easy to use, and will get us results that are more than good enough.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git
cd bwa
make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BWA takes <strong>fastq</strong> files containing samples, along with a <em>fasta</em> file containing a reference genome to map the strings contained in our <strong>fastq</strong> file. Reference genomes are usually put out by the scientific wing of a National Government, Regional Organizations, and some Universities. We’ll get our Wuhan Coronavirus Reference genome from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> hosted by the US Federal government. A good sample to run against the Wuhan reference is the Washington state outbreak that happened early in the US, the <em>fastq</em> data for this is also hosted by the NCBI at their <a href="https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR11278092">Sequence Read Archive</a>. In the animated terminal above (Fig 2.) we see the commands needed to create our mapped genome from our input files, including retrieving the data from the databases . If you’d like to skip all that, we’re hosting both the reference genome, and the completed alignment map over at <a href="https://lucidalign.com/#cov">Lucid Align</a>. We’ll be using the <strong>bam</strong> file to detect our mutations, and we can also browse the genome of this Washington state outbreak sample using any sequence alignment viewer.</p>

  </iframe>
</p>

<p>But before going on to variant calling this first sample let’s just prepare another sample while we’re making these alignment maps. Let’s do a more recent outbreak, from Kent, UK; which is far from Wuhan &amp; the Washington sample, in both time &amp; space. Retrieving the samples from the European Nucleotide Archive can be done from this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR4659819">link</a> or from the shell.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools.git
cd python3
enaDataGet.py -f fastq -m -d [output_directory] ERR4659819
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Creating the mapped genome from the Kent, UK outbreak is done the exact same way as with the Washington state outbreak, and now both files can be browsed directly with an alignment viewer. More importantly now we can run the <em>variant detection</em> and see all the mutations in each of these samples compared to the original Wuhan reference genome. Variant callers are an area of hot development for folks working on bioinformatics algorithms &amp; tools. Traditionally, Bayesian methods have been most reliable, but are hard-coded for specific organisms or need the settings dialed-in to get the correct sensitivity to specificity. This is so that we don’t get too many false-positives, while at the same time don’t miss any real mutations. In the last couple of years deep convolutional neural networks have really made a splash in variant calling, where now images are created almost similar to those we see from alignment viewers, and those images are used to train, and then have the neural network make the call on whether there is a mutation in a given section of the alignment map as we make our way down the entire map.</p>

<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/eff_kent.png" alt="Annotated VCF" title="High Impact mutation in Kent UK sample"></p>
<h4 id="fig-4-annotated-mutations-of-kent-uk-strain-b117">Fig 4. Annotated Mutations of Kent UK Strain B.1.1.7</h4>

<p>Bayesian variant callers are fairly simple to install, whereas the DCNN callers will need, in our case, Nvidia cuda drivers, and of course a machine with those GPUs. You could use <a href="https://magnolia.sh/">Magnolia</a> Fig 3., the super-cool neural network based caller that Leo van Driel helped write B-), but for this post we are going to use the built-in caller that comes with <a href="http://www.htslib.org/download/"><em>samtools</em></a> written by the previously mentioned Heng Li.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bcftools mpileup -Ou -f &lt;ref.fasta&gt; &lt;sample1.bam&gt; | bcftools call -vmO z -o &lt;study.vcf.gz&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running any variant caller, we’re left with a <em>vcf</em> file, which is just a list of positions in a genome where the sample has a mutation compared to the reference, it might be good to just look at the file <a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf">format specifications</a> to understand how these <em>vcf</em> files will be used moving forward. We can use the allotted fields in the <em>vcf</em> format to annotate, that is give meaning &amp; context to each of the mutations we detect in the genome. For this sample we’ve used <a href="https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/users_of_snpeff/">SnpEff</a> which makes life super easy by boiling all of the predicted effects of each of the mutations we detected into 3 simple categories, high impact, low, and moderate.</p>

<p>We can see in Fig 4. that running a standard Bayesian variant caller we detected a total of 48 mutations in the Kent UK sample. However, there might be some false-positives in there, it’s always better to be a bit more sensitive than to miss things. Let’s focus on the high impact mutations, things that will change the 3D structure of coronavirus. Looks like we only have 3 of those, all highlighted in red (Fig 4.), at genomic positions, 11288, 27972, and 28270. The VCF file we generated also contains data on which amino acids within the protein structure were changed to what, we can use that information to make the changes in our molecular structure, which in this case we’ve done with a current tool under development.</p>
<h4 id="fig-5-molecular-structure-editor">Fig 5. Molecular Structure Editor</h4>
<p><img src="https://mokasquarl.github.io/images/dalton_beta.gif" alt="Dalton PDB" title="Editing Molecular Structure"></p>

<p>Mutations which change the molecular structure are super important because that is more likely to make things behave differently, this can mean it attaches to human receptors more tightly, interacts with antibodies and drugs differently, because remember at the core of how molecules behave is the old mantra <strong>“form equals function.</strong>”</p>

February 13, 2021 | https://whitmanwire.com/opinion/2021/02/09/op-ed-whitman-proposes-deep-cuts-to-humanities-arts-and-languages/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://whitmanwire.com/opinion/2021/02/09/op-ed-whitman-proposes-deep-cuts-to-humanities-arts-and-languages/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><p><span><p>This week, news was shared with a number of alumni about a recent proposal to generate budget savings through deep cuts to academic programs at Whitman. The proposal was created in response to a crisis in College finances brought on by COVID-19. Among the proposed cuts are six tenure-line positions in Classics, Environmental Humanities, History, Japanese, Mathematics and Statistics and Philosophy that will be eliminated after professors retire. Non-tenure-line positions in numerous other disciplines would also be cut, including Studio Art, Art History and Visual Culture Studies, Biology, Chinese, French, Japanese, Music, Politics, and Theater and Dance. Some adjunct faculty will not get their contracts renewed, while others will see their positions reduced. 68 percent of the faculty cuts are to the humanities and arts, and the cuts amount to 13.7 percent of the total humanities and arts faculty. Languages are taking a particularly big hit, with the proposed elimination of 24 percent of the total language faculty leading to the likely losses of the Classics, Chinese and Japanese majors. The future of the Environmental Humanities major will also be uncertain.</p>
<p>These cuts were developed by a Financial Sustainability Review committee and have blindsided the Faculty. They go against Whitman’s stated Strategic Priorities and violate the principle of shared governance, which gives the Faculty control over the curriculum. Last year, the Faculty were in the process of voting to strengthen the role of language study and environmental literacy in the General Education program. Some of the positions being cut, held by beloved retiring professors, are ones the Faculty previously identified as top priorities for hiring. The cuts also fall heavily on academics rather than on non-academic offices and programs in the College. Some of the proposed cuts, like the reduction of Classics faculty leading to the elimination of Latin and Greek language instruction and the major, are out-of-step with peer institutions. Others, like the loss of Don Snow’s position in Environmental Humanities after his retirement, will throw into doubt the future of a signature Whitman program.</p>
<p>More broadly, cutting nearly one seventh of the humanities and arts faculty will alter the future direction of the College. While crafted in response to the current crisis, the proposed changes will last far beyond it. President Murray communicated that the positions lost this year are unlikely to be reinstated in future years. They thus constitute a long-term shift in resources away from the arts and humanities.</p>
<p>Before the College embarks on such a significant change of course, it could stand to reflect on the value of the humanities, arts and languages at Whitman and in the world. However, the administration has indicated that it has no interest in doing this. The President and the Board of Trustees have given a deadline of February 15 to submit feedback on these proposed cuts. That said, some reflection on the value of the humanities and arts might be in order. The last few years have been tumultuous, and many of the problems we face are precisely what the humanities and arts are primed to address. Confronting political crises and fake news and working for social justice all require the creative, critical thinking that is developed in the very departments being cut. Language study and the intercultural awareness it facilitates are crucial to living in a multicultural, globalized world. As a liberal arts college, Whitman is the place for the in-depth study of the arts and humanities. A robust humanities faculty is one of the hallmarks of a Whitman education. In proceeding with these cuts, Whitman is jeopardizing not only its status as a liberal arts college, but also its mission of preparing students for lives of purpose.</p>
<p>Students and alumni who wish to speak up about these changes or the way they are taking place are encouraged to send their feedback (in separate emails) to President Murray, Professor Barry Balof and Professor Sharon Alker by February 15. Share your personal experience with any of the affected disciplines. Why is the discipline important to you? How did it shape your Whitman experience? Did it influence your decision to attend Whitman? How has it prepared you for life after Whitman?</p>
<p>Financial sustainability is essential to the continuing existence of Whitman College, but so are the arts and humanities. These cuts will transform the nature of the College, but they are not set in stone yet. As an alumni of the Divest Whitman campaign that successfully persuaded the College to divest its endowment of fossil fuel holdings, I know that when there is a groundswell of community sentiment on an issue, the College listens. Make your voice heard while there is still time. Speak up for the humanities, arts and languages at Whitman.</p>

<p>In solidarity with Whitties past, present and future,</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The most common tool for background jobs in Ruby on Rails is Sidekiq. Unfortunately, it's not standalone and it has Redis as a dependency. In this post, I will present an alternative approach for scheduling tasks in Rails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh come on! What's the problem with Sidekiq? It's well tested and widely used in many production apps!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please remember that I focus on product bootstrapping. Time to market is crucial. I'm also a one-man army and I try to minimize any unneeded maintenance.</p>
<p>To be able to use Sidekiq you need to set up and maintain a new service with Redis. It takes time and effort. I was looking for a solution to quickly implement scheduled jobs without any overhead for my Rails app: <a href="https://getaproductjob.com/?ref=kwcodes">Get a Product Job</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine, why cannot you just use cron?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> and its services don't have cron out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=kwcodes">Integromat</a>. It's a tool for automating processes and it has an attractive free tier (1000 operations/month). Just enough for small side projects.</p>
<p>How to glue it with the Ruby on Rails app?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of this approach?<br>
✅ Quick implementation.<br>
✅ No new layers to maintain (Redis + Sidekiq).<br>
✅ Money saved on new services (quite important when you're just starting out and validating ideas).</p>
<p>🚨 Not the safest solution. You might consider adding authorization or at least server-side checks to make sure that the task is not run too often.<br>
🚨 For some of you, Integromat free tier might not be enough.<br>
🚨 If not careful, you can easily exceed Integromat's free tier.</p>

<article>
    <p>It seems that networking equipment vendors have some tradition of using display connectors for other purposes.</p>
<p>HP, <a href="https://jackstromberg.com/2013/01/stacking-with-the-dell-powerconnect-5548s/">Dell</a> and Netgear use HDMI cables for stacking networking switches. According to <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/408925/stacking-two-netgear-gs748ts-switches-via-hdmi-only-1gbps-trunk-bandwidth">this</a> Serverfault answer, a HDMI 1.3 or 1.4 compliant cable is needed for achieving the near 10Gbit theoretical throughput on Netgear hardware. The HDMI spec has specified the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#HEC">HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC)</a>, but that is only 100BASE-T, so these vendors have made a different implementation.</p>
<p>Cisco is known to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-force_helix">60-pin low-force helix</a> connector for their legacy <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/interfaces-modules/1700-2600-3600-3700-1-port-serial-wan-interface-card/7265-hw-1t-wic.html">Serial WAN Interface Card (WIC-T1)</a>. It is typically used as a display connector on workstations, because it enables connecting up to 4 displays through a single connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/cisco_lfh.jpg" alt="Connector"></p>
<p>3Com used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB13W3">DB13W3</a> with the Dual Speed Hub 500 for a redundant DC power supply connection. Even though the connector itself is slightly different because the pins in the large holes are missing, a standard DB13W3 cable seems to fit. I don’t have this hub so I haven’t tested it myself, but I would be suprised if it doesn’t fit. I hope nobody their office burned down because a DB13W3 intended for displays was used instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/DB13W3_connector.jpg" alt="Connector"></p>
<p>The connector is specified further in the manual:</p>
<p><img src="https://eloydegen.com/blog/images/Number8.png" alt="Number 8 description"></p>
<h2 id="legality">Legality</h2>
<p>If there isn’t a patent or copyright on the design of the connector and the official logo or name is not used, then I think it’s legal, but this does not seem to be the case with HDMI®.</p>
<p>The official Dell manual is calling it “HDMI Ports”, but those ports are certainly not implementing the HDMI protocol. I wonder if any lawyers would argue that this is a trademark infringement.</p>

For an $n \times n$ magic square, the magic constant is</p><center> $\begin{align*} \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n^2} k \end{align*}$ </center><p>For example, a magic square with dimensions $3 \times 3$ would have magic constant $15,$ and dimensions $4 \times 4$ would have magic constant $34.$</p><p>To solve a magic square, we must fill in each element with a number in ${1, 2, \ldots, n^2 },$ and each number must appear exactly once. A $3 \times 3$ magic square could look like this:</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 6 \\ 9 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 \\ 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 8 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}$ </center><p>Or this:</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 8 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 9 \\ 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}$ </center><p>It may seem like a $3 \times 3$ magic square can have multiple solutions. But looking closer allows us to see that the two matrices above are actually both the same configuration. The second matrix is just the first matrix rotated $180$ degrees. In general, rotating and flipping a magic square in any direction will still yield a valid magic square.</p><h2>Solving a Magic Square Using Brute Force</h2><p>How can we build a program to construct one of these magic squares?</p><p>Just like every problem, the simplest way to solve a magic square is to use brute force. It will be the most inefficient solution we can think of, but it will give us some grounding to see which areas we need to improve it in. To get some code down, we can write something like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>():

</pre></div></span></p><p>The classic $9$-nested-for-loop approach. It is quite inefficient, but it will do the job. Each $x_k$ variable represents a space in the square. There are 9 spaces, so we nest $9$ loops, $1$ for each space. Each loop will loop through all the possible numbers in that space, $1$ through $9.$</p><p>To write the <code>is_valid</code> function, we need to check for duplicate values, which can easily be done with the use of a set. Then we have to check if each row, column, and diagonal adds up to a certain number, so we can just make a list of all those and check if they are equal to $15$ at the end.</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span>(square, n):

For a $3 \times 3$ square, we would set $n=15.$ For a $4 \times 4$ square, we would set $n=34.$</p><h2>Brute Force Takes Forever!</h2><p>Let’s talk about timing. We have $9$ nested for loops, and the <code>is_valid</code> operation is in the deepest one. Since each loop is going to run $9$ times to test each number $1-9$ in each element of the square, it’s going to run the <code>is_valid</code> function $9^9$ times, which is absolutely insane.</p><p>Using Python’s <code>timeit</code> module, we can see how long the <code>is_valid</code> function takes to run:</p><ul><li>$1.6 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if there are duplicate values</li><li>$5.3 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if there are no duplicate values</li><li>$6.3 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ to run if the square is valid</li></ul><p>With this brute force algorithm, we can expect that the vast majority of iterations are going to have duplicate values in them. So, I’ll be generous and say that each time it runs, $1.6 \, \mu\textrm{s}$ pass. That means the amount of time it takes is $9^9 \times 1.6 \textrm{ usecs} \sim 10.3 \textrm{ minutes}.$</p><p>What if we wanted a $4 \times 4$ magic square? Well, we can use the equation again: $16^{16} \times 1.6 \mu\textrm{s} \sim \textbf{600 millennia}.$ It’s very unlikely that the human race will even exist for that long; we might have destroyed the earth along with the computer that was running this algorithm by then. We need to write a more efficient algorithm.</p><h2>Backtracking</h2><p>The problem with brute force is that it spends too much time looking through solutions that will never work. For example, the algorithm starts out with the square</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}, \end{align*}$ </center><p>and then advances to</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}, \end{align*}$ </center><p>and then</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix}. \end{align*}$ </center><p>There’s absolutely no point in checking any square with the first $3$ numbers as $1$ because we’re not allowed to have duplicates.</p><p>To avoid configurations like $1,1,1$ as the top row, we can use a technique called <b>backtracking</b>. Whenever we reach a configuration that won’t work, we “backtrack” and skip over that configuration instead of wasting tons of time modifying it in ways that will never make it valid.</p><p>Using backtracking, we would skip over all configurations that have duplicates, and instead start out with</p><center> $\begin{align*} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}. \end{align*}$ </center><p>To implement backtracking, we’ll start by skipping over configurations with duplicates. In each for loop, before entering the next loop, we will check if the number has been duplicated anywhere. We will only check the rest of the square if the number isn’t duplicated. Implementing this, we end up with the following code:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>()

</pre></div></span></p><p>Once we run this code, we notice a massive improvement in performance! Within only a couple of seconds, our algorithm actually finds multiple squares.</p><p>With this new algorithm, we skip all squares which repeat numbers, which will always be invalid. So, we are looping through all permutations. We can expect to run the validation function about $P(10, 9) = 3,628,800$ times, which is much less than the $9^9$ times we had to check last time.</p><p>Now, this method speeds up our code, but by how much? Theoretically, it takes $P(10, 9) * 1.6 \mu\textrm{s} \sim 5.8 \mu\textrm{s}$ to just run all the validations. (We introduced a bunch of ‘if’ statements in between each of the for loops, so it will take a bit longer in reality.) But the point is, our new algorithm works $10,600\%$ faster than the old one!</p><h2>Using a While Loop</h2><p>Still, we have another problem left, and that is the quality of the code. No one wants to have to look at a cascading abyss of for loops and if statements while writing their code, so let’s see if we can combine all this into a single while loop.</p><p>If you think about it, we can treat the square as a list of numbers instead of a list of rows. Instead of $[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],$ we can store the array as $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].$ Now, that means we will need a function to convert the flat list into a square:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>arr_to_square</span>(arr):
    side_length <span>=</span> <span>int</span>(<span>len</span>(arr) <span>**</span> <span>0.5</span>)
    <span>return</span> [arr[i:i<span>+</span>side_length] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>len</span>(arr), side_length)]
</pre></div></span></p><p>Now, let’s think of how we can structure the while loop. We want the loop to keep going until both the value None is nowhere to be found in the list, and the square is valid. We can use the <code>or</code> operator to run the loop if <code>None</code> is in the square, or the square isn’t valid, like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>gen_magic_square</span>(size):
    n <span>=</span> get_magic_const(size)
    square <span>=</span> [<span>None</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(size<span>**</span><span>2</span>)]
    
    <span>while</span> <span>None</span> <span>in</span> square <span>or</span> <span>not</span> is_valid(arr_to_square(square), n):
        <span>pass</span>
        
    <span>return</span> arr_to_square(square)
</pre></div></span></p><p>You’ll notice I use the function <code>get_magic_const</code>, which computes the magic constant, like this:</p><p><span size="3em"> <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div><pre><span>def</span> <span>get_magic_const</span>(side_length):
    <span>return</span> side_length<span>*</span>(side_length<span>**</span><span>2</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>)<span>/</span><span>2</span>

<p>Mental fog is often described as a “cloudy-headed” feeling.</p>
<p>Common conditions of brain fog include poor memory, difficulty focusing or concentrating, and struggling with articulation.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could concentrate your brain power into one bright beam and focus it like a laser on whatever you wish to accomplish.</p>
<p>Many people struggle to concentrate. And when you can’t concentrate, everything you do is harder and takes longer than you’d like.</p>
<h3><strong>Give up the&nbsp;clutter</strong></h3>
<p>Mess creates stress.</p>
<p>There’s a strong link between your physical space and your mental space.</p>
<p>Clutter is bad for your mind and health. It can create long-term, low-level anxiety.</p>
<p>When the book, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2tvOPr0" data-href="http://amzn.to/2tvOPr0" target="_blank"><em>The Japanese Art of Reorganizing and Decluttering</em></a><em>,</em> by Marie Condo became a best-seller, it wasn’t too surprising.</p>
<p>We are all looking for ways to create more meaningful lives with less to distract us.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Get rid of clutter at your office, on your desk, in your room, and you will send a clear message of calm directly to your brain.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Start decluttering today in small, focused bursts. You’re not going to clean up your entire space in a day, so start small to make it a daily habit that sticks.</p>
<p>Set yourself up for success by making a plan and targeting specific areas you’re going to declutter, clean up, and organize over a prolonged period of time.</p>
<h3>Multi-tasking doesn’t&nbsp;work</h3>
<p>The ability to multi-task is a false badge of honor.</p>
<p>Task switching has a severe cost.</p>
<p>Your concentration suffers when you multitask.</p>
<p>It compromises how much actual time you spend doing productive work, because you’re continually unloading and reloading the hippocampus/short term memory.</p>
<p>Research shows that tasks switching actually burns more calories and fatigues your brain – reducing your overall capacity for productive thought and work.</p>
<p>Commit to completing one task at a time.</p>
<p>Remove potential distractions (like silencing your mobile, turning off email alerts ) before you start deep work to avoid the temptation to switch between tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Use the 3-to-1 method!</strong></p>
<p>Narrow down your most important tasks to 3, and then give one task your undivided attention for a period of time.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to rotate between the three, giving yourself a good balance of singular focus and variety.</p>
<h3>Give up the urgent distraction</h3>
<p>Disconnect. Your productivity, creativity and next big idea depends on it.</p>
<p>Urgency wrecks productivity. Urgent but unimportant tasks are major distractions.</p>
<p>Last-minute distractions are not necessarily priorities.</p>
<p>Sometimes important tasks stare you right in the face, but you neglect them and respond to urgent but unimportant things.</p>
<p>You need to reverse that. It’s one the only ways to master your time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Your ability to distinguish urgent and important tasks has a lot to do with your success.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Important tasks are things that contribute to your long-term mission, values, and goals. Separating these differences is simple enough to do once, but doing so continually can be tough.</p>
<h3>Stop feeding your&nbsp;comfort</h3>
<p>Comfort provides a state of mental security.</p>
<p>When you’re comfortable and life is good, your brain can release chemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which lead to happy feelings.</p>
<p>But in the long-term, comfort is bad for your brain.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Without mental stimulation dendrites, connections between brain neurons that keep information flowing, shrink or disappear altogether.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>An active life increases dendrite networks and also increase the brain’s regenerating capacity, known as plasticity.</p>
<p>“Neglect of intense learning leads plasticity systems to waste away,” says Norman Doidge in his book, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2Fnh3to" data-href="http://amzn.to/2Fnh3to" target="_blank">The Brain That Changes Itself</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Merzenich, a pioneer of plasticity research, and author of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://amzn.to/2oXkPj3" data-href="http://amzn.to/2oXkPj3" target="_blank">Soft-wired: How the New Science of Brain Plasticity Can Change Your Life</a> says that going beyond the familiar is essential to brain health.</p>
<p>“It’s the willingness to leave the comfort zone that is the key to keeping the brain new,” he says.</p>
<p>Seeking new experiences, learning new skills, and opening the door to new ideas inspire us and educate us in a way improves mental clarity.</p>
<h3>Don’t sit&nbsp;still</h3>
<p>Sitting still all day, every day, is dangerous.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, physical activity can have potent effects on your brain and mood.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The brain is often described as being “like a muscle”. Its needs to be exercised for better performance.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Research shows that moving your body can improve your cognitive function.</p>
<p>30–45 minutes of brisk walking, three times a week, can help fend off the mental wear and tear.</p>
<p>What you do with your body impinges on your mental faculties.</p>
<p>Find something you enjoy, then get up and do it. And most importantly, make it a habit.</p>
<h3>Stop consuming media and start creating&nbsp;instead</h3>
<p>It’s extremely easy to consume content.</p>
<p>You are passive. Even relaxed.</p>
<p>But for each piece of unlimited content you consume, it stops a piece of content you could have created.</p>
<p>Limit your mass media consumption.</p>
<p>Embrace the creation habit.</p>
<p>Start paying attention to the noise that you let seep into your eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Ask, Is this benefitting my life in any way?</p>
<p>Does all this information make me more prone to act?</p>
<p>Does it really make me more efficient? Does it move me forward in any significant way?</p>
<p><strong>Let creation determine consumption.</strong></p>
<p>Allow curiosity to lead you to discover and pursue something you deepy care about. Make time to create something unique.</p>
<p>The point is to get lost in awe and wonder like you did when you were a child. When you achieve that feeling from a certain activity, keep doing it!</p>
<p>Share your authentic self with the rest of us.</p>

Of course you would. Who doesn’t want to behave and think more reasonably? Good news: New <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00712-1.epdf?sharing_token=X5MjwLDRSAiHhYFktvZ76lxOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHujAy2n79E2tUrp3HAv2i2Rrv1or3LrbmAiE9eh_bR3MkKnec-0-hNfUvcab7_4M1ok7U8kigFHdoAAa1GE9E9bFZBKLcGwfALPGhRiaNM-YdOySqPSSQinxc3Z2msPPzI=" target="_blank">research</a>, from Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, suggests mindfulness, or at least an aspect of it, can help. By “<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/16/nothingness/an-atheists-guide-to-spirituality" target="_blank">mindfulness</a>”—a feature of Buddhism for thousands of years, and a subject of scientific investigation for a few decades—most people mean a mental state you can be in. Let’s try.</p><p>Pay attention to your current sensations—the feeling of your back against a chair, or the weight of your phone in your hand. Pay attention to the thoughts and feelings flitting in your mind. Don’t “judge” them. Merely notice that they’re there. If you find yourself bringing past or possible future events into your imagination, let those drift off, and attend again to your present sensations, thoughts, and feelings. Not too difficult, right? Being mindful for a few seconds is easy. Being mindful for an hour is very difficult.</p><blockquote><p>It appears that mindfulness reduces cognitive bias, but these results need to be interpreted carefully.</p> </blockquote><p>One way to encourage people to be more mindful is to ask them to try to notice more things, and one way to measure mindfulness is to measure their ability to do so. Langer and her colleague Philip Maymin, of Fairfield University, used this aspect of mindfulness to try to reduce that familiar enemy of rationality—cognitive biases. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">names</a> for over 100 of the systematic ways we think about the world irrationally. But it is likely that many are multiple names for the same underlying psychological process. (The tendency to give new names for things that already have names my colleague and I playfully call the <i>McKee-Davies bias</i>, which might be the first bias to be named as a result of itself.)<br></p><p>Maymin and Langer randomly divided 109 people into a “mindless” control group, a “low-mindful” group, and a “mindful” group. The low-mindful group chose their favorite of two random-dot patterns with subtle triangles. The mindful group looked at two slightly-less random images, and spotted hard-to-find differences between them. Then they looked at two nearly identical images of a fruit pile at once, and tried to spot which fruit, from one of the piles, was missing. Maymin and Langer measured people’s mindfulness using a survey, specifically a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2158921#:~:text=Overall,%20the%20present%20study%20suggests,for%20both%20individuals%20and%20organizations." target="_blank">14-item measure</a> that focuses on flexibility of thinking and noticing new things (an admittedly Western conception of mindfulness).</p><p>The results confirmed that the mindful group, as a result of the attention they paid to their task, was actually mindful, and the mindless and low mindful groups were not.&nbsp;</p><p>The people in the mindful group also became more rational, in terms of bias. Maymin and Langer quizzed them on a bunch of questions measuring 22 cognitive biases that scientists have established. These included the conjunction fallacy (thinking that the amount of something specific is greater than the general category, like Republican bankers are more common than bankers), and the gambler’s fallacy (thinking that, after flipping a coin and getting “heads” a few times, “tails” will be more probable than 50 percent on the next roll). They found that the mindful group showed improvement on 19 out of the 22 biases.&nbsp;</p><p>It appears that mindfulness reduces cognitive bias, but these results need to be interpreted carefully. For one thing, although it purports to be about mindfulness in general, it is not clear the study’s intervention and mindfulness measure get at what people often take mindfulness to mean. For example, the training involved asking people to look for differences between photographs, and the Langer Mindfulness Scale, which the researchers used as a measure for mindfulness, asks questions about engagement, seeking novelty, and producing novelty. Although scientists have validated this measure, and found that it correlates with many things we would hope mindfulness would, neither the intervention nor the scale addresses thinking about the future, judgment of thoughts, focus, or <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/the-problem-with-mindfulness" target="_blank">mindfulness meditation</a> (the practice of doing nothing but sitting, or sometimes walking, and paying attention to the here and now). So, this study does not show evidence that your rationality is improved by being mindful in the sense of how you go about dealing with your own thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be better to interpret these findings as showing that cognitive bias can be reduced by encouraging people to pay closer perceptual attention to their environment—an important aspect of mindfulness, which many people often think of as a stress reducer that, practiced regularly and enough, can lead to a happier life.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>It’s too bad people generally aren’t very mindful. A 2010 <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full" target="_blank">study</a> found that people’s minds wandered 47 percent of the time, and the only activity that people reliably focus on is making love. If you’re pretty well-trained in mindfulness meditation, you can mindfully do anything.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it better to be mindful? There is some evidence that, in general, people are happier if they are thinking about what they’re doing, even if that thing isn’t any fun, like washing the dishes. However, there is also <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-13229-002" target="_blank">evidence</a> that thinking about happy things from your past (nostalgia) increases pain tolerance, positive mood, empathy, and creativity, and reduces anxiety, boredom, and stress. So, though mindfulness is generally good, it’s perhaps not something to strive for at <i>every</i> moment. When vacationers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837207/" target="_blank">look forward</a> to their trips, for example, they’re a little happier. These results show that sometimes thinking about the past and the future can make you happier.</p><p>It’s encouraging to know that merely paying attention to the details of your environment, what Langer calls&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSde3wV3-Qc&amp;t=0m50s" target="_blank">active noticing</a>,” can make you a little more rational.</p><p><i>Jim Davies is a professor at the Department of Cognitive Science at Carleton University.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Dear Alpha community, our partners, and DeFi users, as we have shared earlier, we have closed the loophole that made the exploit possible. We’d like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped us, be it on the technical front and non-technical front. We sincerely appreciate it. We are investigating with the relevant parties and will investigate with the authorities to trace the attacker.</p><p>Now, we would like to share a post mortem on the recent Alpha Homora V2 exploit to explain</p><p><strong>1. What happened</strong></p><p><strong>2. Who is affected</strong></p><p><strong>3. What’s next and</strong></p><p><strong>4. Walk through of technical analysis of what happened.</strong></p><p>This exploit is complicated, involving more than 9 transactions. We hope this thorough post mortem will not only be helpful to the Alpha community and our partners, but also to other projects and builders in DeFi.</p><p>This moment shows how important it is to continue helping each other out and building a safer DeFi ecosystem for everyone. Alpha team is committed to building and helping builders in the space to create a stronger and safer DeFi ecosystem.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2><p>On Feb 13 5:37AM UTC, an attacker exploited Alpha Homora V2 using a series of complex transactions, which involved flashloans.</p><p>Here’s what the attacker need to know about the code and the setup in order to execute the attack:</p><ul><li>HomoraBankv2 has an sUSD pool on a contract level in preparation for the upcoming release, which is neither available on the UI nor publicly announced.</li><li>There was no liquidity in sUSD lending pool, so the attacker can fully manipulate and inflate the total debt amount and total debt share.</li><li>There is a rounding miscalculation in borrow function calculation, which only affects when the attacker is the sole borrower.</li><li>resolveReserve function can increase totalDebt without increasing totalDebtShare and the function, intended for collecting revenue to the reserve pool, can indeed be called by anyone.</li><li>HomoraBankv2 accepts any custom spell, as long as the invariant checks out that collateral &gt; borrow (a spell is similar to a strategy in Yearn).</li></ul><h2 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h2><p><strong>The debt is not between users and Alpha Homora v2, but between Alpha Homora V2 and Cream V2. </strong>This is because Alpha Homora V2 is integrated with Cream V2 (Iron Bank) in a protocol-to-protocol lending way. Thus, the debt is between the two protocols and not the users. </p><p>Alpha team will work with Andre and Cream team to find remedial actions to resolve the debt.</p><p>Currently, borrowing (new leveraged positions and borrowing more to the existing positions) are now paused. Lenders can still lend. Leveraged yield farmers can still repay their debt, add collateral, and close the positions.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2><p>Alpha team will work with Andre and Cream team to find remedial action to resolve the debt. </p><p>The team, trusted builders in the space, and security experts will continue to investigate this exploit further, so we will continue to pause borrowing.</p><p>We will maintain a constant communication with our community.</p><p>Once the recheck and investigation is complete, Alpha Homora V2 and Iron Bank will continue to operate normally with more leveraged pools, more lending assets, more features, and better improvement. </p><p>While Alpha Homora V2 has gone through 2 audits by Quantstamp and PeckShield, we will not only work with more audit firms but also work with more trusted builders in the space to help read through the contracts.</p><p>This incident has helped us and will continue to help us bond stronger as a community, and we look forward to building a brighter and safer future.</p><h2 id="walk-through-of-technical-analysis">Walk through of technical analysis</h2><ul><li>Attacker address: 0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57</li><li>Attacker’s txs: <a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57">https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x905315602ed9a854e325f692ff82f58799beab57</a></li><li>Evil spell address:<br><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x560a8e3b79d23b0a525e15c6f3486c6a293ddad2">https://etherscan.io/address/0x560a8e3b79d23b0a525e15c6f3486c6a293ddad2</a></li></ul><h3 id="exploit-analysis">Exploit Analysis</h3><p><strong>1.</strong>The attacker created an evil spell (can think of this as equivalent to Yearn’s strategy). <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> Attacker swaps ETH -&gt; UNI, and supply ETH + UNI to Uniswap pool (obtaining ETH/UNI LP token).

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-12">Marc on 2021-02-12</h2>

<p>Despite increasing leniency on frameworks being the <em>only</em> way to build for the web<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, hand-written HTML never disappeared and I feel is still a perfectly suitable way to build a personal website.</p>

<p>This notion was spurred on a few weeks ago when I decided to do some decluttering on my machine: removing old files, temporary scratchpads, and the like…and then I got to my site directory. 875MB. Despite only containing a few blog posts (read: text files), my site was taking up more space than every Wikipedia article on Computer-Science combined, with 200MB+ still to spare.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Where were these hundreds of megabytes coming from?</p>

<p>As it turns out <code>node_packages</code> was the root of the problem. Dependencies that required other dependencies. Packages so far removed from my end-point there was no way to even guess what purpose they served. As much as I enjoyed using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">GatsbyJS</a> - my framework of choice, I couldn't carry on with a system that was in excess of my needs to such a degree.</p>

<p>With this - and a spare few days - I decided to start from scratch, plain HTML and CSS from the ground up. After a day or two I'd managed to piece together a site generator using various Bash scripts comprising of existing Unix commands that took care of almost all the functionality I had before. I was frankly amazed at how seamless the process was with programs like <code>sed</code> and <code>grep</code> being more than capable enough to blaze through converting pages, updating changes, and applying dynamic styling; All with no amorphous packages or hidden boilerplate, just tried-and-true HTML and a Unix toolbox with over 40 years of reliability.</p>

<p>Looking back I wondered why I'd ever thought using a framework was the right choice to begin with: The constant updates, packages fulfilling unknown roles, and boilerplate handling features I'll never use. I was left wondering how a system like this could survive over time.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of a comment I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26019149">saw on Hacker News</a> stating that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's really too much for us to handle, so we build tools and services to help us manage all that information streaming towards us. But what we've forgotten is that we don't need to manage all the information out in the world, all we need to manage is however much we can ingest and digest. The bottleneck in our informational lives is absolutely not inventory management, it's the bandwidth between our ears, which is the same is it's always been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this comment was made in the context of information overload online, I believe it is just as applicable to the increasingly amorphous capabilities of the tools and frameworks we use to power our sites and applications. A self-cannibalising cycle of being overloaded with the number of options presented to us so we create a new option, only to then overwhelm the next person that comes along <em>ad infinitum</em> (<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">Relevant XKCD</a>).</p>

<p>I'm fully aware of the irony in chastising the excessive number of frameworks out there only to have created my own personal one, however I feel there is a key distinction between the two. My personal framework was created as a learning project to help me not only manage this site going forward but also gain a deeper understanding of the tools I use on a daily basis. Because this site is built with just the 3 core languages of the Web (HTML, CSS, and JS) that knowledge is not only going to be long lasting but also easily transferable, regardless of what Web-based projects I work on next. In addition, the Bash scripts that help tie everything together are just Unix commands, programs that will be available almost anywhere I choose to work from.</p>

<p>When it comes to typical Web frameworks however, a considerable number are put out into the wild competing against each other claiming to be <em>the definitive</em> framework which only ends up muddying the matter. In addition, most require knowledge that is unique to that particular framework, making migration challenging. Of course, this is certainly not to say that all frameworks are bad and we should return to the Web of the 90's; A more complex Web will always require more complex tools. However, for smaller simpler use-cases like a personal blog, plain HTML can still do the job just fine.</p>

<p>Working in a Computing-Science related job/field inherently requires the continual learning of new skills. However, surely that time is better spent learning <em>new</em> skills rather than progressing to where we already were before? Is it not a better option to expand your knowledge of your current toolkit rather than move and start afresh with a new one purely because it is newer?</p>

<p>I don't have a particularly grand statement with this post other than that when building your site, don't just leap straight to using the latest and greatest framework or technology. HTML never went away, it is still the fundamental backbone of the Web no matter how many layers we heap on top of it. </p>

		<p><em>But they focus on building a social network instead</em></p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/LucaBongiorni/status/1359560585990537216">developpers</a> wake up in 2021 and discover that Linkedin is a business social network, Sales people have for a long time accepted that their linkedin account is one of their company's communication channel</p>
<p>Linkedin knows your connections, your past jobs, your customers, your main skills, what you are interested in, the number of employees in each company in the world, if a company is growing or shrinking, what companies say, who interact with them. They know as much of a company as the company itself. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2019/09/10/linkedin-data-scraping-ruled-legal/">Seeing how much they prevent scrapping</a> they know their data is valuable. As a result of that you can be sure that they use this data to solve big problems. Well no, they don't, their three main paying features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make people pay to send messages to other people</li>
<li>Give a few filters to search people</li>
<li>Let people post job offers</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are NOT EVEN good at it!</p>
<p>Despite that, they could help solving the two most difficult tasks of business: Finding customers and recruiting</p>
<h2>Recruiting</h2>
<p>I'm not going to say that hiring is broken, it is the same thing as dating. People don't know what they need nor want, so they talk to a few people until they find one that makes them feel good and then they hire him. I'm clearly not sure it is a much better process than picking random people in the crowd and hiring them, but at least they are happy about their choice.</p>
<p>There are two parts in the recruiting process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding qualified candidates</li>
<li>Interviewing them</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Linkedin is not going to help interviewing candidates it can make finding qualified candidates much easier. Today the process to find candidates is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create vague job offers that almost use the same terms as Google job offers.</li>
<li>Publish it in your ATS</li>
<li>Wait for unqualified candidates to apply to your offer (unless you are Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber or any other trendy company)</li>
<li>In the meantime go on Linkedin, type a few keywords in the search bar, use a few criterias to get a list of candidates</li>
<li>Browse the list of candidates and verify one by one if the candidate really match the keywords you typed</li>
<li>Harass each candidates to get a call with him</li>
</ol>
<p>Why things need to be so complex when Linkedin knows if a user is available for a new position, knows how much money he needs, what are their skill, where he lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>How could Linkedin have not solved the "experience level" filters ? Have you ever used it ? It doesn't even somewhat work, it doesn't work at all. An actual intern can be tagged as an expert, and expert as an intern . Why can't I get a list of product managers with years of experience</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't help recruiters find candidates by position ? Why recruiters have to know that: front-end engineer, front engineer, UI engineer, react developer, front developer all mean the same thing ?</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't unify job position titles by company ? Software developers is the name in some companies, in others it is engineers, in others it is developers, in others it is consultants. Linkedin can figure all that, they have the data to do some clustering</li>
<li>Why when searching for product managers, Linkedin also suggests you people who are "production managers" ?</li>
<li>Why won't linkedin let recruiters search only people who have logged in on linkedin in the last 3 months and that are actually ok to be solicited ? yeah you can say you are open to work, but that's not the same thing, that's too tough.</li>
<li>Why Linkedin don't unify the recruiting process ? Let users say whatever they want on their profile but put them in a unified bucket. Is that so hard to do for a billion company ? How many attributes are necessary to classify a sales guy for example ? His years of experience, has a sold service, saas, software, physical stuff ... , how much money he wants. That seems to be far from being an impossible thing.</li>
<li>Why Linkedin doesn't help recruiters create useful job descriptions ?  Why do they let companies say things like :<ul>
<li>Excellent time-management skills and the ability to establish reasonable and attainable deadlines for resolution.</li>
<li>Have a service-oriented mind, be analytical, and have strong problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>Strong attention to detail and extremely well-organized.</li>
<li>Positive can-do attitude &amp; ability to work well with teams.</li>
<li>Good at communicating complex ideas and reaching out to different points of view.
Which company is looking for people who are not positive ? Who are badly organized ? Who are bad at communicating ? Who is not analytical ? Who doesn't take attention to details ?
Don't you have more important things to say ? Things like: Work from the office mandatory, can explain his work to non technical people, likes interviewing other engineers...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Linkedin knows really well the candidate and the companies, why don't they actually try to help them communicate ? This market is HUGE. There are billions of dollars of recruiting fees spent every month (150 bn a year in the US)
And they are the only one that can offer that, as you need the data on at least the company or the candidates to make a product about recruiting. If you want to help candidates find job offers, you need data on business, and only linkedin has them. For example the number of employees ONLY linkedin has this data (and crunchbase a bit). As for if you want to offer a product for business, then you need to have candidates. And once again only Linkedin has this data.</p>
<h2>Finding customers</h2>
<p>When I talk about customers, I only mean business customers. Finding consumers is a different thing that I'm not sure Linkedin can help at.</p>
<p>So we are talking about B2B.
Here are the different ways to find customers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay people to tell people they know to buy your offer. ex: Digital marketing, Partnership, Physical marketing, invite existing customers to restaurant, strategic hiring, ...</li>
<li>Go to a place where people who work for the type of business you are interested in go. Talk to people, and pitch your offer. ex: Marketing events, Networking dinner, Conferences, ...</li>
<li>Pay people to find and convince businesses to buy your offer. ex: salespeople</li>
</ol>
<p>Linkedin is today the place most sales and marketing people find contact. And that sucks. A LOT !</p>
<p>Whether you are in 2. or 3. what you want from Linkedin is :</p>
<ul>
<li>Let you choose the type of company you are interested in</li>
<li>Find the employees responsible for the topic you are selling</li>
<li>Give you their email address</li>
</ul>
<p>Today it is impossible to filter companies, you can search them by name but that's all. There is an 'industry' filter, but, lol, complete garbage. You can find by location and company size though, and that works, which is pretty remarkable to finally find something that works.</p>
<p>And for finding employees it is pretty difficult for the same reason that searching for candidates doesn't work. With job position titles not being standardized you can't really search efficiently.</p>
<p>But even so. Imagine you found one person that you think may be interested about your offer. How do you actually make sure that this person is interested ? For most businesses the answer is : I will design a loop of 5 emails talking about the topic that I'm trying to sell. And I will send you an email every 4 days until you actually accept or refuse. If at the end of the 5 mails you had no response, I will contact another person in your company and send them the same 5 mails, until someone answers me.</p>
<p>For some of you that method can seem like harassment, and it is. But it is the only method available to find customers. Some are going to say that if people don't answer that's because they are not interested. Well it is impossible to say, sometimes people answer you after 5 emails and are actually pretty interested about what you are offering.</p>
<p>In an ideal world we would have a marketplace of needs and offers. You could push an offer to people who are really in the target group and you could find offers matching your needs. And for that, the bigger the marketplace the better. I'm not going to describe how this should work, or how this could work. But it is obvious that Linkedin is uniquely positioned to create that kind of service.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that instead of that they are focusing on getting more businesses to pay to send InMail to unqualified users.</p>
<p>The data of linkedin is a goldmine but today it rests unused so that users can annoy their network with stupid clickbaik posts</p>

This time we are going to talk about how to interact with Outlook from Excel using macros, and also we are going to release a <strong>PoC where we turn Outlook into a keylogger</strong>. Please, take a seat and listen to the story.</p>  <p><em>We promise this is the last time <a href="https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL">@TheXC3LL</a> will publish about VBA. We have scheduled an exorcism this weekend to release his daemons, so he can write again about vulnerabilities and other stuff different to VBA.</em></p>  <p>In our first chapter we talked about the concept of <a href="https://adepts.of0x.cc/kerberoast-vba-macro/">“Hacking in a epistolary way”</a>, where we started to implement attacks and TTPs directly in VBA macros avoiding process injections, dropping binaries or calling external programs that are flagged (like Powershell). This time we are going to shift our focus to Outlook.</p> <p>First of all we have to say that you can interact with Outlook directly from other Microsoft Office apps via VBA using the object <code>Outlook.Application</code>. This means that we can abuse Outlook functionalities from within Excel, so we can look for confidential information inside the inbox or we can exfiltrate data via mails. To send a mail only a few lines are needed:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>'https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.namespace</span>

This will move directly the mail to the Deleted folder, so it is a bit more stealthy. To fully erradicate the mail we need to locate the mail (as item) inside the Deleted folder and then call the method <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.items.remove"><code>Remove</code></a> via MAPI.</p>  <p>The object <code>Outlook.Application</code> gives us also access to the namespace <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/office/vba/api/outlook.application.getnamespace">MAPI</a> and all its methods.

However both approaches can be executed <strong>inside</strong> Outlook via OTM files as we will see below.</p>  <p>In the last years various persistence methods related to Outlook were released and implemented in the tool <strong><a href="https://github.com/sensepost/ruler">Ruler</a></strong>. These methods were based on the execution of VBA code via <a href="https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/">Custom Forms</a> and <a href="https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-home-page-another-ruler-vector/">Home Pages</a>. Both attacks are now patched, so we have to move forward.</p> <p>Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/domchell">Dominic Chell</a> published the article <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/11/a-fresh-outlook-on-mail-based-persistence/">A Fresh Outlook on Mail Based Persistence</a> where the persistence is achieved dropping a <strong>VbaProject.OTM</strong> file that is later loaded by Outlook. This is the path that we choosed here. But instead of using a payload to get a shell or parasite a process with our C2, we are going to create a keylogger in pure VBA <strong>:)</strong>.</p> <p>Outlook is one of the long term alive programs in an average office computer. It is launched since the workday beginning and is not closed until the worker leaves the office, so makes sense to use it as a keylogger. The plan is quite simple: we need to build an Excel file that modifies the registry (so Outlook can execute macros freely) and drops the OTM file with our keylogger.</p> <p>As the registry key is under <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> we do not need special privileges to modify the value (by default it is set at level 3 <em>Notifications for digitally signed macros, all other macros disabled</em>) so we enable the load and execution of macros by changing the value to 1 (<em>Enable all Macros</em>):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Sub</span> <span>disable_macro_security</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We use the Excel version (<code>Application.Version</code>) to calculate the right location of the key to be modified. After that the OTM file can be dropped to <code>Environ("appdata") &amp; "\Microsoft\Outlook\VbaProject.OTM"</code> (it can be packed inside a resource, form, or taken directly from internet and then read/unpack and dropped). It is nothing new, all the good ol’ techniques to drop files apply here, let’s move to the OTM contents and the keylogger.</p> <p>For our keylogger we are going to use the function <strong><code>NtUserGetRawInputData</code></strong> that is not documented in the MSDN. But as usual: if something is not covered by Microsoft, go and check ReactOS. Luckily it is <a href="https://doxygen.reactos.org/d0/dc0/ntstubs_8c.html#ad041c37a6375f9be19cac8f4636d468e">documented</a>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>DWORD</span> <span>APIENTRY</span> <span>NtUserGetRawInputData</span> 	<span>(</span> 	<span>HRAWINPUT</span>  	<span>hRawInput</span><span>,</span>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 16 January 2015</em></p><p>It’s easy to view yourself as “not a <em>real</em> programmer.”  There are programs out
there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal.
Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic
idea of that software is quite simple.  Implementing it yourself is a fun way to
show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.  So, this is a
walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that
it makes other people feel that way too.</p>

<p>The code for the shell described here, dubbed <code>lsh</code>, is available on
<a href="https://github.com/brenns10/lsh">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University students beware!</strong> Many classes have assignments that ask you to
write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code.  If you’re
a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code
without permission.  And even then, I would <a href="https://brennan.io/2016/03/29/dishonesty/">advise</a> against heavily relying on this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="basic-lifetime-of-a-shell">Basic lifetime of a shell</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a shell from the top down.  A shell does three main things in its
lifetime.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
configuration files.  These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret</strong>: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be
interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong>: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we’re
going to use them for the basis for our shell.  Our shell will be so simple that
there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command.
So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.  But in terms of
architecture, it’s important to keep in mind that the lifetime of the program is
more than just looping.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Load config files, if any.
</span>
  <span>// Run command loop.
</span>  <span>lsh_loop</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Perform any shutdown/cleanup.
</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I just came up with a function, <code>lsh_loop()</code>, that will
loop, interpreting commands.  We’ll see the implementation of that next.</p>

<h2 id="basic-loop-of-a-shell">Basic loop of a shell</h2>

<p>So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up.  Now, for the basic
program logic: what does the shell do during its loop?  Well, a simple way to
handle commands is with three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the command from standard input.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse</strong>: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong>: Run the parsed command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for <code>lsh_loop()</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>lsh_loop</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>

<p>Let’s walk through the code.  The first few lines are just declarations.  The
do-while loop is more convenient for checking the status variable, because it
executes once before checking its value.  Within the loop, we print a prompt,
call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and
execute the args.  Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created
earlier.  Note that we’re using a status variable returned by <code>lsh_execute()</code> to
determine when to exit.</p>

<h2 id="reading-a-line">Reading a line</h2>

<p>Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.  The
sad thing is that you don’t know ahead of time how much text a user will enter
into their shell.  You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed
it.  Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it,
reallocate with more space.  This is a common strategy in C, and we’ll use it to
implement <code>lsh_read_line()</code>.</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first part is a lot of declarations.  If you hadn’t noticed, I prefer to
keep the old C style of declaring variables before the rest of the code.  The
meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) <code>while (1)</code> loop.  In
the loop, we read a character (and store it as an <code>int</code>, not a <code>char</code>, that’s
important!  EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it,
you need to use an <code>int</code>.  This is a common beginner C mistake.).  If it’s the
newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it.  Otherwise,
we add the character to our existing string.</p>

<p>Next, we see whether the next character will go outside of our current buffer
size.  If so, we reallocate our buffer (checking for allocation errors) before
continuing.  And that’s really it.</p>

<p>Those who are intimately familiar with newer versions of the C library may note
that there is a <code>getline()</code> function in <code>stdio.h</code> that does most of the work we
just implemented.  To be completely honest, I didn’t know it existed until after
I wrote this code.  This function was a GNU extension to the C library until
2008, when it was added to the specification, so most modern Unixes should have
it now.  I’m leaving my existing code the way it is, and I encourage people to
learn it this way first before using <code>getline</code>.  You’d be robbing yourself of a
learning opportunity if you didn’t!  Anyhow, with <code>getline</code>, the function
becomes easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>lsh_read_line</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ssize_t</span> <span>bufsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// have getline allocate a buffer for us
</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getline</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bufsize</span><span>,</span> <span>stdin</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>feof</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span>  <span>// We recieved an EOF
</span>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span>  <span>{</span>
      <span>perror</span><span>(</span><span>"readline"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_FAILURE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not 100% trivial because we still need to check for EOF or errors while
reading. EOF (end of file) means that either we were reading commands from a
text file which we’ve reached the end of, or the user typed Ctrl-D, which
signals end-of-file. Either way, it means we should exit successfully, and if
any other error occurs, we should fail after printing the error.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-line">Parsing the line</h2>

<p>OK, so if we look back at the loop, we see that we now have implemented
<code>lsh_read_line()</code>, and we have the line of input.  Now, we need to parse that
line into a list of arguments.  I’m going to make a glaring simplification here,
and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line
arguments.  Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from
each other.  So the command <code>echo "this message"</code> would not call echo with a
single argument <code>this message</code>, but rather it would call echo with two
arguments: <code>"this</code> and <code>message"</code>.</p>

<p>With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using
whitespace as delimiters.  That means we can break out the classic library
function <code>strtok</code> to do some of the dirty work for us.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this code looks suspiciously similar to <code>lsh_read_line()</code>, it’s because it
is!  We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding
it.  But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers
instead of a null-terminated array of characters.</p>

<p>At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling <code>strtok</code>.  It
returns a pointer to the first token.  What <code>strtok()</code> actually does is return
pointers to within the string you give it, and place <code>\0</code> bytes at the end of
each token.  We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character
pointers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary.  The process repeats
until no token is returned by <code>strtok</code>, at which point we null-terminate the
list of tokens.</p>

<p>So, once all is said and done, we have an array of tokens, ready to execute.
Which begs the question, how do we do that?</p>



<p>Now, we’re really at the heart of what a shell does.  Starting processes is the
main function of shells.  So writing a shell means that you need to know exactly
what’s going on with processes and how they start.  That’s why I’m going to take
us on a short diversion to discuss processes in Unix.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix.  The first one (which
almost doesn’t count) is by being Init.  You see, when a Unix computer boots,
its kernel is loaded.  Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only
one process, which is called Init.  This process runs for the entire length of
time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the
processes that you need for your computer to be useful.</p>

<p>Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for
processes to get started: the <code>fork()</code> system call.  When …</p></div></div>

<p>My first programming languages were Lisp, Scheme, and ML. When I later started to work in OO languages like C++ and Java I noticed that idioms that are standard vocabulary in functional programming (fp) were not so easy to achieve and required sophisticated structures. Books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> were a great starting point to reason about those structures. One of my earliest findings was that several of the GoF-Patterns had a stark resemblance of structures that are built into in functional languages: for instance the strategy pattern corresponds to higher order functions in fp (more details see <a href="#strategy">below</a>).</p>
<p>Recently, while re-reading through the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> I thought it would be a good exercise to map the structure of software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Classification_and_list">design-patterns</a> to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library and in functional programming in general.</p>
<p>By searching the web I found some blog entries studying specific patterns, but I did not come across any comprehensive study. As it seemed that nobody did this kind of work yet I found it worthy to spend some time on it and write down all my findings on the subject.</p>
<p>I think this kind of exposition could be helpful if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a programmer with an OO background who wants to get a better grip on how to implement complexer designs in functional programming</li>
<li>a functional programmer who wants to get a deeper intuition for type classes.</li>
<li>studying the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">Typeclassopedia</a> and are looking for an accompanying reading providing example use cases and working code.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf">Typeclassopedia</a> is a now classic paper that introduces the Haskell type classes by clarifying their algebraic and category-theoretic background. In particular it explains the relationships among those type classes.</p>
<p>In this chapter I’m taking a tour through the Typeclassopedia from a design pattern perspective. For each of the Typeclassopedia type classes I try to explain how it corresponds to structures applied in software design patterns.</p>
<p>As a reference map I have included the following chart that depicts the Relationships between type classes covered in the Typeclassopedia:</p>

<li>Solid arrows point from the general to the specific; that is, if there is an arrow from Foo to Bar it means that every Bar is (or should be, or can be made into) a Foo.</li>

<li>Monad and ArrowApply are equivalent.</li>

<h3 id="data-transfer-object-functor">Data Transfer Object → Functor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the field of programming a data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one call only. (quoted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Transfer Object is a pattern from Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a>. It is typically used in multi-layered applications where data is transferred between backends and frontends.</p>
<p>The aggregation of data usually also involves a denormalization of data structures. As an example, please refer to the following diagram where two entities from the backend (<code>Album</code> and <code>Artist</code>) are assembled to a compound denormalized DTO <code>AlbumDTO</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dtoSketch.gif" alt=""><figcaption>DTO</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, there is also an inverse mapping from <code>AlbumDTO</code> to <code>Album</code> which is not shown in this diagram.</p>
<p>In Haskell <code>Album</code>, <code>Artist</code> and <code>AlbumDTO</code> can be represented as data types with record notation:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Album</span> <span>=</span> <span>Album</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>    title       ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">  ,<span> publishDate ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4">  ,<span> labelName   ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  ,<span> artist      ::</span> <span>Artist</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-7"></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>data</span> <span>Artist</span> <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><span>    publicName ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10">  ,<span> realName   ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-11">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-12"></span>
<span id="cb1-13"><span>data</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> <span>=</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><span>    albumTitle  ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-15">  ,<span> published   ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-16">  ,<span> label       ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-17">  ,<span> artistName  ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb1-18">} <span>deriving</span> (<span>Show</span>, <span>Read</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The transfer from an <code>Album</code> to an <code>AlbumDTO</code> and vice versa can be achieved by two simple functions, that perfom the intended field wise mappings:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>toAlbumDTO ::</span> <span>Album</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">toAlbumDTO <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> t, publishDate <span>=</span> d, labelName <span>=</span> l, artist <span>=</span> a} <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">  <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> t, published <span>=</span> d, label <span>=</span> l, artistName <span>=</span> (publicName a)}</span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><span>toAlbum ::</span> <span>AlbumDTO</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Album</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">toAlbum <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> t, published <span>=</span> d, label <span>=</span> l, artistName <span>=</span> n} <span>=</span></span>

<p>In this few lines we have covered the basic idea of the DTO pattern.</p>
<p>Now, let’s consider the typical situation that you don’t have to transfer only a <em>single</em> <code>Album</code> instance but a whole list of <code>Album</code> instances, e.g.:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>albums ::</span> [<span>Album</span>]</span>
<span id="cb3-2">albums <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    [</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-5">             publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-6">             labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-7">             artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Geir Jenssen"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb3-8">    , <span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Apollo - Atmospheres &amp; Soundtracks"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-9">             publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1983</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-10">             labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Editions EG"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-11">             artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Brian Eno"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb3-12">    ]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case we have to apply the <code>toAlbumDTO</code> function to all elements of the list. In Haskell this <em>higher order</em> operation is called <code>map</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>map</span> _f []    <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>map</code> takes a function <code>f :: (a -&gt; b)</code> (a function from type <code>a</code> to type <code>b</code>) and an <code>[a]</code> list and returns a <code>[b]</code> list. The <code>b</code> elements are produced by applying the function <code>f</code> to each element of the input list. Applying <code>toAlbumDTO</code> to a list of albums can thus be done in the Haskell REPL GHCi as follows:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span> toAlbumDTO albums</span>
<span id="cb5-2">[<span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>, published <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>, label <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>, artistName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>},</span>
<span id="cb5-3"> <span>AlbumDTO</span> {albumTitle <span>=</span> <span>"Apollo - Atmospheres &amp; Soundtracks"</span>, published <span>=</span> <span>1983</span>, label <span>=</span> <span>"Editions EG"</span>, artistName <span>=</span> <span>"Brian Eno"</span>}]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This mapping of functions over lists is a basic technique known in many functional languages. In Haskell further generalises this technique with the concept of the <code>Functor</code> type class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>Functor</code> class is the most basic and ubiquitous type class in the Haskell libraries. A simple intuition is that a <code>Functor</code> represents a “container” of some sort, along with the ability to apply a function uniformly to every element in the container. For example, a list is a container of elements, and we can apply a function to every element of a list, using <code>map</code>. As another example, a binary tree is also a container of elements, and it’s not hard to come up with a way to recursively apply a function to every element in a tree.</p>
<p>Another intuition is that a Functor represents some sort of “computational context”. This intuition is generally more useful, but is more difficult to explain, precisely because it is so general.</p>
<p>Quoted from <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia#Functor">Typeclassopedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, all instances of the <code>Functor</code> type class must provide a function <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>class</span>  <span>Functor</span> f  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>    fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For Lists the implementation is simply the <code>map</code> function that we already have seen above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> [] <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">    <span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Functors have interesting properties, they fulfill the two so called <em>functor laws</em>, which are part of the definition of a mathematical functor:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>fmap</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>id</span>                        <span>-- (1)</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>fmap</span> (g <span>.</span> h) <span>=</span> (<span>fmap</span> g) <span>.</span> (<span>fmap</span> h)  <span>-- (2)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first law <code>(1)</code> states that mapping the identity function over every item in a container has no effect.</p>
<p>The second <code>(2)</code> says that mapping a composition of two functions over every item in a container is the same as first mapping one function, and then mapping the other.</p>
<p>These laws are very useful when we consider composing complex mappings from simpler operations.</p>
<p>Say we want to extend our DTO mapping functionality by also providing some kind of marshalling. For a single album instance, we can use function composition <code>(f . g) x == f (g x)</code>, which is defined in Haskell as:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>(.) ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> c</span>
<span id="cb9-2">(<span>.</span>) f g x <span>=</span> f (g x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the following GHCi session we are using <code>(.)</code> to first convert an <code>Album</code> to its <code>AlbumDTO</code> representation and then turn that into a <code>String</code> by using the <code>show</code> function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> album1 <span>=</span> albums <span>!!</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span> album1</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span>Album</span> {title <span>=</span> <span>"Microgravity"</span>, publishDate <span>=</span> <span>1991</span>, labelName <span>=</span> <span>"Origo Sound"</span>, artist <span>=</span> <span>Artist</span> {publicName <span>=</span> <span>"Biosphere"</span>, realName <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>"Geir Jenssen"</span>}}</span>
<span id="cb10-4">λ<span>&gt;</span> marshalled <span>=</span> (<span>show</span> <span>.</span> toAlbumDTO) album1</span>
<span id="cb10-5">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t marshalled</span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>marshalled ::</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>print</span> marshalled</span>
<span id="cb10-8"><span>"AlbumDTO {albumTitle = \"Microgravity\", …</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://share.descript.com/view/gVn4KDWrmsE">Listen to the audio version on Descript 🔉</a></p>

<p>It's been just over eight months since I left Nexmo/Vonage, where I'd been for over four years, and I'll admit to having spent a few hours reflecting upon my decision to leave. It's also that time of year when many people seem to get a new job and change companies so now seems like a good time to share some advice and some of my experiences.</p>

<p>When frustrated or tired of a job the most obvious reaction for many is to look for another job at another organisation. Sometimes a change in scenery can be what you need. The grass may be greener on the other side. But, there's also a chance it won't be and a move may not always be what you need. So, it's worth considering alternative options.</p>

<h2 id="take-a-break"><a href="#take-a-break">Take a Break</a></h2>

<p>Before you make any hasty decisions take some time off from your current role and try not to think about it. This will give your subconscious a chance to really process things. If you need an extended amount of time and if you've been at a company for a long time then a sabbatical may be an option. Failing that, and not everyone will be able to do this, you could consider some unpaid leave.</p>

<p>With your mind hopefully relaxed, and if you still feel like a change is required, it's time to consider your options.</p>

<h2 id="is-the-reason-for-moving-on-fundamental?"><a href="#is-the-reason-for-moving-on-fundamental?">Is the Reason for Moving on Fundamental?</a></h2>

<p>It's important to ask yourself if you're moving on for a <strong>fundamental</strong> reason. For example, do you dislike the company values, mission, goals or culture? These things are very difficult to change unless you are part of the company leadership team. Some teams within organisations can have their own culture, values and mission, and generally, be able to function independently. But, for a team to be successful within a business over a long period there has to be a reasonable alignment between a team and a company. So, unless you see positive leadership changes coming this is probably a scenario where the best thing is to move on.</p>

<p>If you're considering moving on for reasons other than a fundamental problem with the company you work for, there are alternatives. Which of these are available will depend on the company but they are worth exploring.</p>

<h2 id="try-a-different-role"><a href="#try-a-different-role">Try a Different Role</a></h2>

<p>If you have a reasonably broad range of skills, the company you work for requires some of your other skills, and another role available, trying that different role may be an option. Some companies may invest in retraining you so that you can take on that role.</p>

<p>For example, within <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html">Developer Relations</a> it may be possible to move from Developer Advocacy, where there's a requirement for a broad range of skills, to something more focused like Developer Education.</p>

<h2 id="propose-an-alternative-role"><a href="#propose-an-alternative-role">Propose an Alternative Role</a></h2>

<p>If there are things that you want to do that you're not presently getting to do why not see if you can create an alignment between the company, team and your goals?</p>

<p>Back in 2010 while working as an engineering team lead at Caplin Systems, I decided I wanted to focus on <a href="https://www.leggetter.co.uk/real-time-web-technologies-guide/">real-time web technologies</a>. I liked the people I worked with and the company I worked for was progressive and supportive. So, I spoke to the leadership team about my goals and we came up with the idea of putting our real-time technology in the cloud and making a <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/kwwika">hosted service</a> available to developers. This created a new role for me and began my journey into Developer Relations.</p>

<h2 id="change-teams"><a href="#change-teams">Change Teams</a></h2>

<p>Can you change teams? This is likely only going to be an option at larger organisations where there are multiple teams with the same role. But moving teams, working with new people and taking on new challenges could be the change that you need.</p>

<h2 id="maybe-the-grass-will-be-greener"><a href="#maybe-the-grass-will-be-greener">Maybe the Grass Will be Greener</a></h2>

<p>Once you've considered all the alternatives you may decide it really is time to move on.</p>

<p>When I decided to move on from Nexmo/Vonage I was sure it was the right move but, over the past eight months, I have had the occasional moment where I wondered if I made a mistake. I'm very proud of the Platform &amp; Developer Experience team (including DevRel) we'd built at Nexmo/Vonage and many of the people in the wider organisation were nice.</p>

<p>However, upon reflection, I did make the right decision. For me it was fundamental: I felt that the company was going in the wrong direction from both a cultural and product perspective. I also looked at the VP (in all but title) job that - through the team's success - I’d ended up in and it was not the sort of role I wanted within Vonage at that time. So I discussed the situation with my colleagues, with leadership, wrote up a job spec for my successor and decided it was time to move on.</p>

<p>So, if you're reading this because you've been wondering if the grass will be greener, please do ensure you've considered all your options before making your decision. Whatever you decide, good luck! 🍀</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-932acedf8b238320f52f"><div><h3><strong>Prices reflect information</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. Prices are not simply a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of economic production, communicating knowledge across the world and coordinating the complex processes of production.”</p><p>— Saifedean Ammous</p></blockquote><p>Prices are the coordinating force of a free market system. Each individual decision-maker can rely on the prices of goods and services to help with their decision making, as the prices themselves are a distillation of all known market information into a single metric. In other words, the compression of all relevant data is ultimately manifested as price (for the more technie minded, it’s a one-way hash function).</p><p>Each individual’s buy and sell decisions, in turn, further shape prices that carry this altered information back out into the market. Some of you may have heard of this from “Efficient market hypothesis” which is about how information in the market is reflected in the price of assets like equities.</p><h3><strong>Money is the measuring stick</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“Money is the central information utility of the world economy. As a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account, money is the critical vessel of information about the conditions of markets.” — George Gilder</p></blockquote><p>Capitalist economies are not equilibrium systems but dynamic domains of entrepreneurial experiments. Money should be a standard of measure for the outcomes of entrepreneurial experiments.</p><p>The essence of Capitalism is all about the efficient allocation of capital given the constraints of scarce resources and time. Companies are experiments on how to best allocate capital, and money is the standard measure for efficiency. Making money represents the efficient allocation of capital, losing money is not an efficient use of capital. And competition means decentralized planning by many separate companies and people to solve a problem in the market.</p><p>Capitalism, much like nature (evolution = random walk), is about experimentation.</p><h3><strong>Information is Decentralized</strong></h3><p>A centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society (Hayek’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_knowledge_problem">Local Knowledge Problem</a>”). A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. Each company is an attempt to take the local knowledge that it has and create a good or service that ultimately is the correct capital allocation (aka profit).</p><p>To highlight how decentralized this information is, I’m going to give an example by Milton Friedman who made the statement: “There’s not a single person in the world who knows how to make a pencil:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The wood comes from a tree</p></li><li><p>To cut down that tree, it took a saw</p></li><li><p>To make the saw, it took steel. To make steel, it took iron ore</p></li><li><p>Graphite, comes from some mines in South America</p></li><li><p>The eraser, which is rubber, probably comes from the tropics</p></li><li><p>Or the yellow paint</p></li><li><p>Or the glue that holds it together</p></li></ul><p>There was no central planning office. It was the magic of the price system.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610323211272_9027"><div><h3><strong>Central banks have an unsolvable data problem</strong></h3><p>Central banks inherently have a data problem. There’s an ingestion, processing, decision bottleneck — same as any electronic signal processing system. An economy cannot be planned by a central authority, because there is no way that a central authority can have all of the necessary knowledge to make the best decision at any single point in time, let alone all points in time.</p><blockquote><p>“It is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality”</p><p>— Hayek</p></blockquote><p>To operate effectively, central banks would have to ingest trillions of data points daily, and ingest those data points in a perfect manner which is impossible. Every single uber taken, every single sandwich purchased, every single in-app purchase.</p><blockquote><p>“We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.” — Philip Tetlock</p></blockquote><p>We’ve created central banks because we want the world to make sense, and we want to feel that there is someone in charge. Even if we were able to ingest perfect data, it is hard to infer simple causality for this complex, chaotic system which involves billions of decision makers. While determining the relationship between weather and crops might seem easy, how do we determine the causality of burrito demand? Economics isn’t like the sciences, we are hamstrung by small or incomplete sample sizes. We can’t re-run the Dot com bubble with a different central bank or a different President.</p><p>This brings us to how central banks measure impact and make decisions. There is a classic product saying that goes “If you can’t measure it you can’t manage it.” It’s hard to even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/redefine-kilogram-180970798/" target="_blank">measure a kilogram</a>&nbsp;with extreme precision, so how could we possibly measure inflation properly? (ex: CPI excludes food and energy!)</p><p>Since big events come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harm than good, giving the illusion of predictability in a world where unforeseen events control most outcomes (Aka black swan events). As Carl Richards says&nbsp;<em>“Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.</em>” Daniel Kahneman also has a great take on the dangers of using history as our guide:</p><blockquote><p>“Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.”</p></blockquote><p>Here’s a useful analogy: Essentially the Fed is driving the car, which is the economy, only using the rearview mirror which is foggy, and the front windshield is opaque (you can’t see the future). How could the Fed possibly drive the car with any accuracy? What if we just let the car self adjust to the conditions of the road?</p><p>History cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable.</p><p>So what is our alternative?</p><h3><strong>Sound Money</strong></h3><blockquote><p>“Sound money is the equivalent of scientific integrity: the system must not permit the manipulation of data after the experiment has taken place.” — Adam Taché</p></blockquote><p>Sound money keeps the ruler settings fixed so results cannot be altered by a centralized planning mechanism.</p><p>And Bitcoin is the perfect iteration of sound money. Bitcoin has a hard cap for several reasons: being a precise measuring stick, reducing political attack vectors, and encouraging speculative bubbles which act as a viral loop.</p><p>But why 21M? Why not 100M?</p><p>It’s precise length is irrelevant. What matters is just that there is a fixed amount. As economic activity moves from a primitive scale, it becomes harder for individuals to make decisions without having a fixed unit of account with which to compare value.</p><p>Regarding political attack vectors, Satoshi felt that setting a “proper” rate of inflation rate was impossible so he decided to remove human decision making from the process. Satoshi has two quotes regarding fixed supply that support this conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>“Indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don’t know a way for software to know the real world value of things.”</p></blockquote><p>Satoshi also says</p><blockquote><p>“If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.”</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Satoshi hypothesized that a fixed supply might create speculative bubbles.</p><p><em>“As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”</em></p><h3><strong>Implications of Sound Money</strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1577480042477_7843"><div><p><br>Bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven asset. As more and more people buy into Bitcoin and that narrative, it becomes the de facto risk off asset.</p><p>Post hyperbitcoiniation, when Bitcoin is the SoV, MoE, and UoA, Bitcoin will reflect the most accurate “risk free” rate of return that we’ve ever had, which enables the economy and market participants to most efficiently allocate resources. Each market participant, both individual investors and corporations, make the risk on/risk off decision which is then manifested in Bitcoin’s price.</p><p>And finally, when Bitcoin is the unit of account and used by every business, market participants can view the flow of funds of their suppliers and customers in real time via their publicly disclosed Bitcoin addresses. This transparency makes markets ultra efficient through the best processing of information.</p><p>Bitcoin rearchitects how capital is efficiently allocated in our economy, ultimately creating a world with more abundance and resources for all.</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below. In 2020, we’ll release a limited edition hard cover collectible, for purchase, which you’ll be notified of by email if you download the free pdf.</p><p>If you found value in this or any of the other essays and articles, please support each of the contributors by sharing it out &amp; following their work.<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

Mutations in p53 are found in over 50% of human cancer, while EGCG is the major anti-oxidant in green tea, a popular beverage worldwide,” said <a href="https://href.li/?http://homepages.rpi.edu/~wangc5/index.html">Chunyu Wang</a>, corresponding author and a professor of biological sciences at <a href="https://href.li/?https://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. “Now we find that there is a previously unknown, direct interaction between the two, which points to a new path for developing anti-cancer drugs. Our work helps to explain how EGCG is able to boost p53’s anti-cancer activity, opening the door to developing drugs with EGCG-like compounds.”</p><p>Wang, a member of the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm_O0FqYSt4">Rensselaer Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies</a>, is an expert in using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study <a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2021/01/26/new-nih-grant-supports-single-molecule-study-protein-key-alzheimer-%E2%80%99s-disease">specific mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease</a> and <a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2017/02/27/hedgehog-cancer-and-zinc">cancer</a>, including p53, which he described as “arguably the most important protein in human cancer.”</p><p>P53 has several well-known anti-cancer functions, including halting cell growth to allow for DNA repair, activating DNA repair, and initiating programmed cell death — called apoptosis — if DNA damage cannot be repaired. One end of the protein, known as the N-terminal domain, has a flexible shape, and therefore, can potentially serve several functions depending on its interaction with multiple molecules.</p><p>EGCG is a natural antioxidant, which means it helps to undo the near constant damage caused during oxygen metabolism. Found in abundance in green tea, EGCG is also packaged as an herbal supplement.</p><p>Wang’s team found that the interaction between EGCG and p53 preserves the protein against degradation. Typically, after being produced within the body, p53 is quickly degraded when the N-terminal domain interacts with a protein called MDM2. This regular cycle of production and degradation holds p53 levels at a low constant.</p><p>“Both EGCG and MDM2 bind at the same place on p53, the N-terminal domain, so EGCG competes with MDM2,” said Wang. “When EGCG binds with p53, the protein is not being degraded through MDM2, so the level of p53 will increase with the direct interaction with EGCG, and that means there is more p53 for anti-cancer function. This is a very important interaction.”</p><p>“By developing an understanding of the molecular-level mechanisms that control key biochemical interactions linked to devastating illnesses such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, Chunyu’s research is laying the groundwork for new and successful therapies,” said Curt Breneman, dean of the Rensselaer School of Science.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://news.rpi.edu/content/2021/02/12/green-tea-compound-aids-p53-guardian-genome-and-tumor-suppressor">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“EGCG binds intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of p53 and disrupts p53-MDM2 interaction”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21258-5">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21258-5</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625997758414929920/synthesizing-cepafungin">Chemists efficiently synthesize natural anti-cancer compound cepafungin I</a></p>

            <p>LOS ANGELES -- 
	Lucasfilm says Gina Carano is no longer a part of "The Mandalorian" cast after many online called for her firing over a social media post that likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the U.S. political climate.</p>
<p>
	A spokesperson with the production company said in a statement on Wednesday that Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm with "no plans for her to be in the future."</p>
<p>
	"Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable," the statement read.</p>
<p>
	Carano fell under heavy criticism after she posted that "Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbours.... even by children."</p>
<p>
	The actor continued to say, "Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbours hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?"</p>
<p>
	Carano, who played the recurring character Cara Dune on the "Star Wars" series, deleted the post but it was widely shared online and spurred the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireGinaCarano?src=hashtag" target="_blank">#FireGinaCarano hashtag</a> to trend. Her character appeared in several episodes of the second season of "The Mandalorian," a series about a bounty hunter and his quest to unite a powerful, young user of the Force with a Jedi Knight.</p>
<p>
	Dune, who in the second season is a lawperson on a frontier planet, frequently teams up with the title character to fight an old nemesis: remnants of the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
<p>
	Carano, a former mixed martial artist whose Dune character used a mix of heavy weapons and her fists to best opponents, had been criticized for social media posts that mocked mask wearing during the pandemic and alleged voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. She also mocked the use of gender pronouns, listing "beep/bop/boop" in her social media bio.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>C++ language include an operator called <code>typeid</code> (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Queries information of a type.<br>
Used where the dynamic type of a polymorphic object must be known and for static type identification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gives you information about the type of an object, as long as it's available.</p>
<pre><code>int a = 0;
std::string tname = typeid(a).name(); // tname == "i"
</code></pre>
<p>How it works?</p>
<h2 id="statictype">Static Type</h2>
<p>For static types, like the example above, compiler has all the information to know the evaluation result of <code>typeid(a)</code>. Let's take at look at the assembly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-14-57.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>call 0x555555555160 &lt;_ZNKSt9type_info4nameEv&gt;</code> is where it calls the <code>name()</code> member function of the result <code>std::type_info</code> object from <code>typeid()</code> evaluation of the expression. We are interested in the <code>this</code> pointer and where the <code>std::type_info</code> object lives.</p>
<p><code>this</code> is stored in <code>%rdi</code> register before a member function call. It's coming from <code>%rax</code> which comes from a <code>%rip</code> relative address. Now we know the <code>type_info</code> object of interest lives at <code>0x7ffff7f827a0</code>, the program looks up the address by looking at what's stored in <code>[rip+0x2eal]</code>. <code>%rip</code> register stores the program counter (<code>$pc</code> in GDB). A process's virtual memory layout looks like</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/memory-layout.png"><figcaption>(from https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/03/linux-processes-memory-layout/)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Program counter (<code>%rip</code>) should always be pointing at the TEXT section of the virtual memory of a running process. So in this case, adding an offset of <code>0x2eal</code>, it's now pointing at the section for storing global data.</p>
<p>To summarize, for static types, compiler has global variables (<code>std::type_info</code>) initialized. At places where the code calls <code>typeid</code>, the machine code just gets the corresponding <code>std::type_info</code> global objects that are already initialized. Done.</p>
<h2 id="dynamictype">Dynamic Type</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-09-32-52.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Here we have an example with dynamic types. Let's check the assembly.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-14-12.png"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Similarly, notice the call to <code>&lt;_ZnKSt9type_info4nameEv&gt;</code>. We are interested in where the assembly got <code>%rdi</code> (<code>this</code>) from.</p>
<p><code>%rbp</code> stores the stack base pointer. Accordingly to the calling convention, <code>[rbp-xxxx]</code> is how a machine gets locally variables for the current function frame. <code>[rbp-0x20]</code> must be getting the only locally variable (<code>foo</code> in this case).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/stackframe1.png"><figcaption>(from https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/02/04/where-the-top-of-the-stack-is-on-x86)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Notice <code>mov rcx, QWORD PTR [rcx]</code>. It took the first 8 byte of <code>foo</code>, and treated it as an address. It's the address to the vtable.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://blog.the-pans.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-from-2021-02-13-10-07-42.png"><figcaption>The first 8 byte of foo is the address to class Bar's vtable</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now <code>%rcx</code> is the address of Bar's vtable. <code>[rcx-0x8]</code> is how it got the address to the <code>std::type_info</code> that we are interested in. This is called RTTI (Runtime Type Information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information</a>). It's kept as a pointer to <code>std::type_info</code> in vtable. The overhead is minimum (no more expensive than an additional virtual method).</p>
<p>You can disable RTTI, and compiler will produce an error if you accidentally use RTTI in your code.</p>

And just like with physical fitness, metabolic fitness improves when we put in the effort.</p><p>Let’s take the analogy of starting a running program to improve our physical fitness in order to run a marathon. Our first jog isn’t going to be 26.2 miles; it’s likely going to be a short slog. But, as we lace up our shoes each day, hit the pavement, and track our progress over time, we see and feel progress. We notice small adaptations in our bodies: our breathing might get easier as we sprint up hills, our muscles become more defined, maybe our mood improves. We might track our mileage in Strava or our heart rate with a Fitbit and get excited as these metrics start to improve. As the weeks of running progress, it is clear that our physical fitness is improving.</p><p>On the flip side, if we decide to take a few months off from training, it’s likely that physical fitness will decline: those hard earned muscles may diminish, and we’d likely feel more winded the first time we get back out there.</p><p>The metabolism is no different. If we make daily choices that support metabolic processes, we will adapt to develop better metabolic fitness. We might not see our muscles grow, but inside our bodies, the microscopic machinery involved in converting fat and glucose to energy become more efficient. While becoming physically fit requires consistent exercise, becoming metabolically fit involves consistent smart decisions about diet (including what to eat, when to eat, and how to pair foods), sleep, stress management, physical activity, and exposure to metabolism-disrupting environmental toxins. Our current level of metabolic fitness is highly dynamic and largely in our control.</p><p>Just like we can track metrics of physical fitness to keep us informed, on-track, and motivated, we can also now track our metabolic fitness. Since glucose is the primary energy building block for our metabolism, tracking this biomarker with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can give us useful insight into our level of metabolic fitness.</p><p>With a CGM, we can see in real-time how our diet and lifestyle decisions are affecting our glucose levels, knowing that over time, stable and healthy glucose patterns lead to improved metabolic fitness. Using the insights from a CGM can help us modulate our food and lifestyle choices to accelerate metabolic progress.</p><p>And, just like with physical fitness, we can see meaningful improvements in our lives even if we haven’t won an Olympic gold metal. Fitness is a spectrum and each small amount of improvement is a win. As with most processes in the body, there is not an “on-off” switch for metabolic health. We are not either “healthy” or “unhealthy.” Rather, we are on a metabolic continuum, and our choices — coupled with our genes — determine where we stand each day.</p><h2>How does glucose fit in?</h2><p>Glucose is a simple sugar that is a breakdown product of the carbohydrates that we eat. When glucose enters the bloodstream, it signals to the pancreas to release insulin, a hormone that tells cells to absorb glucose. Some of this glucose is processed by the mitochondria to form energy (called ATP) that our cells can use. Excess glucose is stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen, and can also be <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11117-triglycerides">converted to triglycerides</a> and stored in fat cells.</p><p>When our bodies need energy, we can tap into glucose from the bloodstream, stored glycogen in the muscles or liver, or we can even make new glucose from other compounds like amino acids (breakdown products of proteins). Aside from using glucose for making energy, we can also break down stored fat to make energy, and convert protein breakdown products to energy.</p><p>However, when our bodies are taxed with processing too much dietary glucose over long periods of time, it throws off the balance of these processes, and leads to health problems. First, chronic excess glucose causes repeated release of insulin. High levels of insulin can, over time, cause cells to become “numb” to insulin’s effect, a process called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170977/"><em>insulin resistance</em></a>. When this happens, less glucose can get into the cells, so circulating glucose rises. Second, high insulin levels block stored fat from being broken down and used for energy. So, ironically, too much energy in the form of glucose leads us to have more trouble using energy effectively.</p><p>Aside from these issues, excess glucose in the bloodstream causes <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.0000034509.14906.ae">inflammation</a> (immune activation), <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23448484/">oxidative stress</a> (an overabundance of damaging free radicals in the body), and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6200622/">glycation</a> (glucose getting “stuck” to things in the body and causing dysfunction).</p><p>Given how many deleterious effects excess glucose can have, it is not surprising that the majority of common chronic diseases are rooted in poor glucose control, including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke, dementia, infertility, and more. This is a relatively modern phenomenon: we used to die of infectious disease and starvation. Now we die of metabolic related disease.</p><p>Why might that be? For starters, we (on average) eat nearly <a href="https://www.thediabetescouncil.com/45-alarming-statistics-on-americans-sugar-consumption-and-the-effects-of-sugar-on-americans-health/">10x more sugar per day than we did 100 years ago</a>. Many of us don’t even realize it, because sugar is so ubiquitous in our food culture, and it wears many masks (link: <a href="https://www.virtahealth.com/blog/names-for-sugar">56 names for sugar</a>). Imagine a factory getting 10x more shipments of raw material and trying to just “make it work.” It wouldn’t. The factory would fall apart. The machines would break. The workers would resist to protect themselves. This is what is happening to our bodies. Additionally, too much dietary fat can impair glucose processing; in fact, excess <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587882/">saturated fat</a> impairs the function of the insulin receptor, leading to more circulating glucose.</p><p>In short, excess energetic precursors like glucose and fat gum up our bodies’ machinery, and are at the root of a vast amount of disease and suffering globally.</p><p>Currently, <a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/11/28/only-12-percent-of-american-adults-are-metabolically-healthy-carolina-study-finds/">only 12% of Americans are metabolically healthy</a>. The other 88% display one or more features that indicate that they have metabolic dysfunction and that their bodies are not able to utilize and process fat and carbohydrates efficiently. In this research study, to be considered “metabolically healthy,” you had to have normal blood glucose, triglycerides (a form of fat that is generated from excess glucose), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and waist circumference, without the need for medications.</p><h2>The many faces of poor metabolic fitness</h2><p>What does metabolic dysfunction and poor metabolic fitness look like? It can be both overt and subtle.</p><p>Overtly, metabolic dysfunction looks like obesity (dysfunctional fat storage), insulin resistance and diabetes (dysfunctional glucose processing), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (dysfunctional management of glucose and fat in the liver), cancer (cancer cells thrive on excess sugar), Alzheimer’s disease (now being called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/researchers-link-alzheimers-gene-to-type-iii-diabetes/"><em>type 3 diabetes</em></a><em>,</em> with evidence of insulin resistance in the brain), cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke (damage to vessels from inflammation and excess glucose), and chronic kidney disease (vessels of the kidney impaired by excess glucose).</p><p>But more subtly, lack of metabolic fitness can look like the full spectrum of daily pain points of modern living that keep us from reaching our full potential and goals: fatigue, brain fog, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382695/">depres…</a></p></div></div></div></section></main></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-4b4cde9dbdbb9767ad24"><div><p>The 2020 pandemic exposed a fundamental flaw in the way the Internet is built.</p><p>Online games were blamed for clogged networks and slowed speeds, but in reality, the Internet is structurally broken when it comes to real-time interactivity. You’ve heard the line:</p><p><strong><em>Kids, get off your consoles; I’m on a video call!</em></strong></p><p>It’s 4 PM on Wednesday. You’re on an important Zoom call and right in the middle of presenting when your face freezes. Those on the call can only catch half of what you say and are left staring at an unflattering image of you mid-word.</p><h3><strong>How We Got Here: The Evolving Internet</strong></h3><p>The Internet is built for the reliable delivery of content, such as e-mail and file transfers, but not built for performance. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)— the standardized routing protocol for the Internet—has no idea what traffic it is routing or in which direction it is sending data. It simply routes data using the cheapest path possible depending on various factors, including politics, commercial agreements, and cost. As a result, certain types of data, namely real-time communications, suffer as the Internet favors servicing volumetric traffic.</p><p>At the start of the millennium, content delivery networks employed global networks of servers to deliver static content faster, leading the way to make OTT (Over-the-top, services offered over the top of traditional content distributors) possible with the infrastructure built by companies such as Netflix, YouTube, and Akamai. More recently, companies like Amazon Web Services have democratized cloud computing, bringing connectivity to more users in more regions of the world. The next evolution of the Internet should be one in which the network itself is democratized, enabling speed-of-light communication for the applications that require high-velocity delivery, such as real-time communications. This means delivering voice over internet protocol calls (VoIP, e.g., Skype, Clubhouse), online multiplayer video games, and more, regardless of the compute or data server owner.</p><h3><strong>Complex Issues with a Complex Network</strong></h3><p>The Internet is a complicated web of networks and billions of computers and devices that connect to each other and work together to send and receive information. The greater the distance between the sending and receiving computers, the longer it takes the data to arrive at its destination. Information can also take different paths, which may increase or decrease the speed of delivery.</p><p>A common analogy used to explain the way the Internet works is the postal service. In the same way that your letter travels from you to the recipient through multiple facilities (carrier, sorting, post office), data travels through numerous routers on its way to the recipient computer. Just as your letter can arrive faster depending on which mail service you use, so too can data transmit faster depending on which path it takes, though the distance between the sender and receiver has the most influence on travel time.</p><p>There are a couple of significant differences in this analogy, however.</p><p><em>One, there are generally more “stops” along the way for data, and two, the data is broken up into multiple smaller “packets” of information rather than sent as one whole mail piece.</em></p><p>Because there are different paths along which individual packets of information can travel, each entailing a variable number of stops along the way, packets of data can easily get lost.</p><p><strong>Packet loss</strong>, as it’s called, results in missing information and a degraded user experience. In a Skype call, packet loss is experienced as gaps in audio. In video games, packet loss results in strange behavior like teleportation, in which a game freezes, then suddenly moves a player’s character to another place when the game resumes.</p><p>Another result of these inconsistent, differing routes is variation in delivery time. Some routes are faster than others, so some packets may arrive more quickly than others since the Internet is not conscious of which path it takes in sending data from one point to another. This variation in the time it takes for data to travel across the network from one endpoint to another is called <strong>latency</strong>, and the result of latency is <strong>jitter</strong>. On a Skype call, jitter manifests as jumbled speech that creates an indecipherable conversation. In video games, jitter manifests in behavior like errant shots, in which a player’s aim may be correct, but the shot doesn’t register in time to hit the target where they are.</p><p>While <strong>lag</strong> (high levels of latency), jitter, and packet loss may impact any online service or application, certain applications depend upon real-time packet delivery and minimal jitter and packet loss to function correctly and maintain a reasonable quality of experience. Packet delivery, consistent latency, and minimal lag are critical for services and applications like VoIP and online gaming and in numerous other industries such as high-frequency trading, telemedicine, and the Internet of Things.</p><p>For these applications, milliseconds saved in delivering data can lead to a real or virtual life-and-death situation and mean the difference between winning and losing millions of dollars or between a quality and a subpar gaming experience.</p><h3><strong>How Subspace Improves Real-Time Application Delivery</strong></h3><p>A millisecond’s delay in delivery does not matter in sending an email or a text message, but it does matter in real-time communications. So why should these applications travel on the same network, in the same way?</p><p>Subspace’s vision is to create an Internet byway through which latency-critical web traffic such as video games, VoIP, and video conferencing can consistently pass through at the speed of light. Like Waze for the Internet, Subspace gives the Internet a GPS of sorts, finding the absolute fastest and most secure and consistent path for real-time data to travel from endpoint to endpoint. As a result, latency and lag are reduced, and real-time applications reach their full potential.</p><p>While other companies have attempted to provide solutions for expediting real-time communications on the Internet, none have addressed the issue across the entire system. Many introduce other issues in their attempts. Commercial networking solutions like Cisco and Juniper were not built for global coordination or to understand and control game traffic. Standalone solutions that require SDKs installed in clients and servers can create significant security and stability risks. And services provided by CDNs like Cloudflare and Akamai utilize the same principles and infrastructure as their primary businesses—that is, volumetric traffic—making the possibility of optimizing real-time traffic at scale a costly and difficult endeavor.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of video games, lag, packet loss, and jitter are such a concern that some game companies have endeavored to build their own custom solutions. This “do it yourself” approach requires massive internal coordination, investment, and attention, which many publishers cannot afford to prioritize. And still, a DIY approach limits the publisher to its existing commercial relationships and capabilities.</p><p>Subspace’s platform optimizes every component of network performance, from the infrastructure stack to the networking stack, including software and hardware, the control plane, and the data plane. With a global Internet architected specifically for real-time traffic at every point, we are achieving speed-of-light communication and democratizing the network. Regardless of the data’s location, Subspace uses a vast system of Internet quality metrics and a proprietary algorithm to direct real-time interactive traffic onto our platform and across the public and our private Internet to and from servers. The algorithm can balance multiple variables to suit each application’s needs—variables such as absolute latency, any latency above a threshold, jitter &amp; loss. The optimal delivery platform via the Subspace onramp drives better, more consistent experiences that match each application’s needs.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612978699676_35285"><div><p>We start with purpose-built points of presence (PoPs), deploying our hardware in data centers worldwide. Each PoP is capable of handling millions of servers, millions of simultaneous user sessions, and enough capacity for all of the user traffic while also providing room for absorbing DDOS attacks, with the expectation that traffic by its nature is mostly small UDP packets.</p><p>The PoPs are distributed globally and specifically network-engineered to reduce the distance needed for players to reach our onramp, minimizing the risk of congestion and misrouting. Players are given a Subspace IP and UDP port as a proxy for a server.</p><p>The Subspace PoP uses a proprietary algorithm to determine the optimal path through our private network before ultimately reaching the game server and back. We do this both ways, packets can take a different route back from the server if Subspace finds a better path for the application needs, another differentiator to CDNs, which are optimized for one-way traffic. Continuous telemetry measures the latency, jitter, and loss between Subspace PoPs, feeding into an algorithm that determines the optimum route between the edge and application servers. On the network’s server-side, we have PoPs directly connected with major providers to minimize latency and lag upon exiting our network.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612978699676_41155"><div><p>Subspace’s global network, which has already launched in multiple regions and is being aggressively deployed towards a global optimized network, already supports some of the world’s most popular online games. And it’s not just about performance. The Subspace platform leverages all of these PoPs to provide a tremendous platform for stopping DDoS attacks against application servers at the edge, before bot networks can aggregate into attacks that get too big to handle or have to be sent off to latency-inducing scrubbing centers. Troublesome attack vectors, replay attacks, and other volumetric attacks can be easily stopped at the Subspace edge, while the game server infrastructure remains protected …</p></div></div></div>

<article id="post-2982">

	

	
	<div>
		<p>This is a follow-up to my previous article about <a href="http://boginjr.com/it/hw/8inch-drives/">connecting old 8″ drives directly to a PC</a> equipped with a classic floppy disk controller. Since there is a way on how to do it on a hardware level without paid or proprietary equipment, there still needs to be a free and available software solution that enables the OS to interface these drives, as they were not officially supported on the PC during its entire history whatsoever. So, during my experiments, I’ve came up with one: <a href="http://boginjr.com/apps/8format/8format.zip">8FORMAT</a> – a small software bundle that’s also released <a href="https://github.com/climatex/8FORMAT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a>.</p>
<p>Since 8 inch drives are vintage and they predate the PC as we know it, my original intent was to experiment with these drives without relying on specialized equipment – an x86 PC with a vanilla floppy controller, with a makeshift cable and a power supply that feeds the drive, was aimed to be enough to make the drive operational. As such, to keep things simple, an OS was chosen that also runs on vintage equipment with no issues, and can provide down-to-the-bone hardware access without driver hassle. Yes, 8FORMAT is a DOS application. So, what does it do exactly?</p>
<p><a href="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-kh4IuA7x" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="8FORMAT, Command line arguments" data-rl_caption="" title="8FORMAT, Command line arguments"><img loading="lazy" src="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1.png 720w, http://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/8format-1-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><strong>Available command-line arguments</strong></p>
<p>Like Dave Dunfield’s ImageDisk (IMD), 8FORMAT is also a multi-purpose DOS application that interfaces the floppy disk controller directly. However, 8FORMAT also tries to persuade the system BIOS to “accept” the drive, so that it can be used directly in DOS – or even Windows (up to 9x/ME). For this to work however, also a FAT filesystem needs to be created on the 8-inch disk, and no DOS utility, including IMD, would do that out of the box. So 8FORMAT was a product of my direct experimentation with these drives under the PC environment, with all of their quirks and pitfalls.<br>
The application has 2 main modes: <strong>formatting</strong> and <strong>using</strong> the disk. In the vanilla <strong>format</strong> mode, 8FORMAT will initialize and format the sectors with the chosen geometry or TYPE. A total of 5 pre-defined geometry types are provided, both the “historical” ones and the “extended”, or experimental ones, to be tried under DOS on an x86 PC. The format and read/write gaps between sectors are auto-set, but can be also tweaked. In addition to that, 8FORMAT can also try writing the DOS boot sector and filesystem, even on a non-512-byte-formatted disk (highly experimental), and it also supports custom floppy disk controllers given their base address, IRQ and DMA settings. Defaultly however, 8FORMAT will only format the disk, and won’t create any filesystems at all.<br>
In the <strong>use</strong> mode, 8FORMAT will install a resident “driver” that overrides the “Diskette Parameter Table” (DPT, INT 1eh) of the PC BIOS and the INT 13h “get drive type” and geometry calls, forcing any application or OS reliant on the BIOS to work with the 8″ drive, even if the physical sector size is non-standard. This includes most versions of DOS and early versions of Windows that were basically just improved DOS shells (1.01 to 4.x, i.e. 95, 98).<br>
However, due to limitations in the BIOS and how the DPT works, once the driver is installed resident, this 8-inch drive data is applied for all floppy drives – 5,25″ or 3,5″ drives will become non-operational and their system BIOS setting ignored. As such, the 8″ drive cannot coexist (properly) with other standard floppy drives in one machine, or on one floppy controller to be exact. And, for this very same reason, 8FORMAT shall only be launched from a hard drive/RAM drive or similar.<br>
The <strong>use mode</strong> can be either invoked by calling 8FORMAT with the <strong>/USE</strong> argument, to start using an 8-inch disk in the drive, and it is also asked at the end of a successful format operation.</p>

(invoking the /USE mode)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>The command-line arguments might seem a little intimidating, but are quite self-explanatory. One of the main arguments is specifying the TYPE, or geometry and density combo of the disk being formatted. This can be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>DSSD</strong> type, which is a double-sided variant of the “historical” single-density format, with 128 byte sectors and 26 of them per track. Choosing this type requires a floppy controller that supports FM encoding at a 250 kbps data rate;</li>
<li>the <strong>DSDD</strong> type, which is – again – a historical format, yielding 8 sectors per track, 1024 bytes each, at a 500 kbps data rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two types were originally used in mainframe and “minicomputer” environments, running CP/M or similar. From the PC perspective, these have a non-standard physical sector size. Although 8FORMAT can make the BIOS recognize these formats, and even try writing a DOS filesystem on them; there are not many applications that use the BIOS disk calls with a physical sector size other than 512 bytes (see the “quirks” below).<br>
In addition to these two “historically standard” formats, there are three “extended” experimental formats that I have came up with, named EXT1 to EXT3:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>EXT1</strong> type is a variant of the historic <strong>DSDD</strong> type, except that it uses 512 byte size per sector. So, instead of eight 1K sectors per track, there are sixteen 512B sectors per track; with the sector gaps reduced slightly to make them fit in a track proper. This type can essentially be called a “DOS-compatible DSDD”, and will safely occupy all the extents of a double-sided, double-density 8-inch floppy disk.</li>
<li>The <strong>EXT2</strong> type is a double-sided variant of the “SS/DD” diskettes that were used in Tandy TRS-80 Model II and similar rigs: 26 sectors per track, each sector with a size of 256 bytes.</li>
<li>And finally, the <strong>EXT3</strong> type, which 8FORMAT tries to access like if it was a DD 5,25″ 360K drive, just with 77 tracks instead of 40, i.e. nine 512-byte sectors per track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, any of these types can be converted to single-side by specifying <strong>/1</strong> as an optional command line argument.<br>
It’s worth noting that only the two 512-byte-sectored formats, <strong>EXT1</strong> and <strong>EXT3</strong>, can be safely used directly under the DOS environment on a PC, because of details that follow below (especially in “Quirk #3”); on an x86 PC, the rest of the formats are for experimentation purposes, mostly when treated as logical formats with a 512-byte geometry (see “Quirk #10”).</p>

<p>Now, for all types <strong>except DSSD</strong> and <strong>EXT3</strong>, you will be needing a floppy disk controller that supports 500 kbps data transfers, i.e. one that is “high density capable” and can read and write 1,44MB 3,5″ (or 1,2MB 5,25″) disks without any issues.<br>
In addition to that, to experiment with type <strong>DSSD</strong>, the FDC as whole (not just the chip itself!), shall also support FM data transfers at a 250 kbps rate. And tell you what, <a href="https://services.theglitchworks.net/ng/testfdc_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not many floppy controllers can do that</a>.<br>
The <strong>EXT3</strong> is an exception, and is the only format that shall (technically) work with a vanilla DD PC floppy disk controller, i.e. the one that only goes with 5,25″ 360K or 3,5″ 720K drives. However, <a href="http://boginjr.com/it/hw/8inch-drives/">out of the three 8-inch drives mentioned in my parent article</a>, the FDCs that I tried were not able to find the address mark of any track formatted this way. In the end, I had to switch the 500kbps data rate manually on with the <strong>/500K</strong> argument, to force “high density” on something that was called “double density” on a much smaller floppy disk.&nbsp; So, an HD-capable PC FDC remains as a necessity for experimentation – but you might be luckier with the EXT3 and your drive 🙂<br>
As a side note, the EXT3 type worked well with a 5,25″ drive on a DD-only floppy controller – of course, only up to track 40. 🙂</p>

<p>The resident driver part (<strong>8TSR.EXE</strong> of the software bundle) is invoked by 8FORMAT after specifying the <strong>/USE</strong> argument, to start using the 8-inch disk in DOS, or directly after a successful format operation, shall the user press ENTER to reflect the new 8-inch geometry. 8FORMAT with /USE shall always be called before the very first 8-inch disk operation with BIOS or DOS, unless the disk was just formatted and ENTER pressed when asked to do so.<br>
This DOS TSR determines the location of the BIOS Diskette Parameter Table (DPT), copies it into a memory location it can write into (if necessary), instructs the BIOS to start using the new 8-inch drive parameters (due to platform limitations, for all floppy drives – sadly), hooks the INT 13h interrupt to start returning the new 8-inch geometry when asked by applications, and also hooks the timer interrupt, that tries to make sure nothing overrides the new 8-inch drive DPT. /NB: This is because in DOS real mode, memory access is unrestricted./<br>
Afterwards, the 8-inch drive can usually be accessed with normal DOS commands, to copy new files, move the other, run applications etc. But, using “specialized” tools that don’t even have the slighest idea about what kind of drive is present in the system (vanilla FORMAT, DISKCOPY, various disk doctors and whatnot) can corrupt the data written on the disk. Remember, 8″ drives were not supported on the PC at all – and the 8FORMAT/8TSR is a hack 🙂</p>

<p>The last application of the software bundle is <strong>TESTREAD.COM</strong>. This is a small DOS application that invokes BIOS INT 13h services /the same ones that DOS uses/ to verify reading a couple of sectors off the specified floppy drive, of what size the sectors are, and dumping them to disk. This can be used, for example, together with 8FORMAT /USE to proof-read whether the actual BIOS can read a non-512-byte-sector floppy, even though 99.9% of applications using BIOS calls WILL expect that the PC BIOS always returns a 512 byte floppy buffer. See the “Quirks” below.</p>

								<h2>Intro</h2>

								<p>This book provides a comprehensive introduction to optimization with a focus on practical algorithms. The book approaches optimization from an engineering perspective, where the objective is to design a system that optimizes a set of metrics subject to constraints. Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, computer science, any engineering field, (including electrical engineering and aerospace engineering), and operations research, and as a reference for professionals.</p>

The answer is no.</p><p>We can set the name property on an input field and access it from the event handler. This value allows us to use a single input handler for <code>onChange</code> events. </p><p>Here’s your current situation when using a not-optimized form with two input fields.

In other words, we can write better readable code that’s also much easier to maintain.</p><p>For this, we’ll be using the <code>useState</code> hook. For those that are not aware of what a hook is and why you would use it. Here’s a short definition from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#whats-a-hook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React documentation</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is a Hook?</strong> A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>When would I use a Hook?</strong> If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.</p></blockquote><p>First, let’s take a look at how we update the state using the <code>setState</code> hook.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    errorMsg</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>""</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    items</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>item1</span><span>,</span><span> item2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Now, let’s make use of the <code>useState</code> hook. We need to import this hook from the <code>react</code> library. We can now declare new state variables and pass them an initial value. We’ll use destructuring to get a variable for retrieving the value and one for setting the value (this one is a function). Let’s take a look at how we can do this for the above example.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useState </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>items</span><span>,</span><span> setIems</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>errorMsg</span><span>,</span><span> setErrorMsg</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Now, you can directly access both constants <code>items</code> and <code>errorMsg</code> in your component.</p><p>Further, we can update the state inside a function like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useState </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>items</span><span>,</span><span> setIems</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>errorMsg</span><span>,</span><span> setErrorMsg</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setItems</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"item A"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"item B"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>          </span><span>Set</span><span> items</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>That’s how you can use state hooks.</p><h2 id="4-cache-expensive-operations-with-usememo">#4: Cache expensive operations with useMemo</h2><p>Memoization is an optimization technique to store the result of expensive operations. In other words, a sorting operation is often an expensive operation that requires a lot of processing. We don’t want to execute this expensive function for every page render.</p><p>Therefore, we can use the <code>useMemo</code> hook to remember the output when you pass the same parameters to the <a href="https://rossbulat.medium.com/how-to-memoize-in-react-3d20cbcd2b6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">memoized function</a>. The <code>useMemo</code> hook accepts a function and the input parameters to remember. React refers to this as a dependencies array. Every value referenced inside the function should also appear in your dependencies array.</p><p>Here’s a simple, abstract example. We pass two parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to an expensive function. As the function uses both parameters, we’ve to add them to the dependencies array for our <code>useMemo</code> hook.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> memoizedValue </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useMemo</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>computeExpensiveValue</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="5-decouple-functions-into-pure-functions-to-improve-code-quality">#5: Decouple functions into pure functions to improve code quality</h2><p>As a general React best practice, you should decouple functions that don’t rely on your component. In other words, a function that doesn’t rely on any state or React hooks.</p><p>Therefore, a sorting function is an excellent example of a function that you can extract as a pure function. </p><p>You might wonder why you should embrace functional programming? </p><blockquote><p>Functional programming is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Pure function are better readable and easier to test. Therefore, they improve code quality. - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/intro-to-functional-programming-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a></p></blockquote><p>Now, let’s apply this concept to React components. Here’s a function that can sit both inside a React component or outside. Both are comparison functions, which you can pass to an expensive sorting function, that accept two input parameters. As there’s no interaction with the state, we can extract both functions to pure functions. This allows us to place the pure functions in a separate file and import them in multiple locations if needed.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>ascSort</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> a </span><span>&lt;</span><span> b </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>b </span><span>&gt;</span><span> a </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>descSort</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> b </span><span>&lt;</span><span> a </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>&gt;</span><span> b </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="6-create-custom-react-hooks">#6: Create custom React hooks</h2><p>We’ve learned how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useMemo</code> React hooks. Yet, React allows you to define your own React hooks to extract logic and make components more readable. </p><p>We can specify custom React hooks starting with the <code>use</code> keyword, like all other React hooks. It’s beneficial when you want to share logic between different functions. Instead of copying the function, we can define the logic as a React hook and reuse it in other functions.</p><p>Here’s an example of a React component that updates the state when the screen size gets reduced to below 600 pixels.

<p>Taking a glance at the weather when leaving your cozy bunker is a very useful thing. It allows you to prepare for the ever-changing conditions and select protective gear according to the situation. You definitely need one!</p>

<p>To achieve that, of course, you can use your portable computing device (aka smartphone). But trust me, it is much more convenient when a nifty screen describing current and predicted weather condition resides on a shelf near the exit airlock. </p>

<p>As information is rarely updated, the natural choice for display is e-ink technology. A lot of engineers are using Raspberry Pi to drive it. But even Pi Zero is too much overhead for the simple task of downloading JSON file and presenting it on the screen (and I'm not even speaking about bringing node.js to the equation). It is like using a sixteen wheeler for door-to-door pizza delivery.</p>

<p>Much more suitable for the job is ESP32 system-on-a-chip. Recently I've discovered awesome boards from <a href="http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50031&amp;Id=1148&amp;FId=t3:50031:3">LilyGO</a>. It has an 2.7" white/black/red e-ink display and wifi/bluetooth. Boards are programmable from Arduino IDE without shady software. Could be powered from literary everything: power bank, battery salvaged from your old mp3 player, LIR2450 coin cell battery... As it refreshes once in an hour you will get months of runtime - so combined with wifi - no wires on your shelf. Also, it has an sd card reader, 4 programmable buttons and pins for the speaker and microphone, in case you want some extra functionality.</p>

<p>Board comes assembled, with an e-ink display. From your side, you only need to connect to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dmi3/26d3924f5b4600e5dc5197d1c3da7f43#user-content-battery">power source</a> (connector included, just connect wires together) and upload some software. LilyGO will take care of charging your battery (up to 500mA). See:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/dmi3/26d3924f5b4600e5dc5197d1c3da7f43#weather-gadget">→ Bill of materials</a></p>

<p>Uploading software is easy. Just connect the board to a USB port and upload via Arduino IDE (no need to flash sd card). There is a lot of weather display code in the web. I've <a href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather">modified one of examples a bit</a> to show data useful to me.  See setup instructions and troubleshooting on <a href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather#readme">GitHub</a>. In my case display looks like this:</p>

<div>
            <p><a href="#weather3_preview">
              <img src="https://developer.run/pic/weather3-300x.png" alt="Weather Gadget Thumbnail">
            </a></p><p>Weather Gadget</p>
        </div>
        <p><a href="#_" id="weather3_preview">
          <img src="https://developer.run/pic/weather3.jpeg" alt="Weather Gadget">
        </a></p>

<ol>
<li>Red Alerts for the weather if any</li>
<li>Current temperature (and "feels like" temperature)</li>
<li>Humidity and wind</li>
<li>Temperature graph in next 24 hours</li>
<li>Probability of precipitation in next 24 hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The software connects to your wifi, downloads the latest data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a>, redraws the e-ink display, then goes to sleep for 30 minutes. I've also added ping to <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a>. If the board will not ping it for some time (because of a dead battery or software error), I will get a notification to my email from Healthchecks.io.</p>

<p><a name="github" href="https://github.com/dmi3/weather">Source on Github</a></p>

<p>Of course, you can put the board in some photo frame as people usually tend to do. But for me, the current aesthetic looks cool. Also, the weather is just one of the examples of what you can do with this awesome board. See <a href="https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T5-Epaper-Series">more examples</a>.</p>

February 13, 2021 | https://liftm.io/posts/cursed-curried-elixir.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liftm.io/posts/cursed-curried-elixir.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2021-02-13">2021-02-13</time>
      <p>In <a href="https://liftm.io/posts/curried-elixir.html">Curried Elixir</a>, I said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going to do this by wrapping <code>my_fun</code> in a chain of anonymous functions, each binding exactly one name:</p>
<pre><code>curried_fun =
  fn (a) -&gt;
    fn (b) -&gt;
      fn (c) -&gt;
        my_fun.(a, b, c)
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And then went on implementing <code>curry</code> as a recursive function. But what if I actually want my curried function to be a chain of anonymous functions, and get rid of this recursive call?</p>
<p>The obvious thing to do would be to try to implement this as a macro instead. But I think we can do better than this.</p>
<p>First, let's look at the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/syntax-reference.html#the-elixir-ast">AST</a> for the <code>curried_fun</code> above:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; quote do
...&gt;   fn (a) -&gt;
...&gt;     fn (b) -&gt;
...&gt;       fn (c) -&gt;
...&gt;         my_fun.(a, b, c)
...&gt;       end
...&gt;     end
...&gt;   end
...&gt; end
#                ▼ metadata                ▼ nested anonymous function
{:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[{:a, [], Elixir}], {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, ...}]}]}]}
#                      ▲ list of parameters
</code></pre>
<p>This might look a bit messy, but there really isn't much going on:</p>
<pre><code>{:fn, [], # The definition with an empty list of metadata
 [
   {:-&gt;, [],
    [
      [{:a, [], Elixir}], # Left-hand side of `-&gt;`, the head of the anonymous function
      {:fn , [], # Right-hand side of `-&gt;`, the body of the anonymous function
       ...
</code></pre>
<h2>Building the AST</h2>
<p>Just to get started, let's see if we can write a function that generates this AST for us.
We want this function to take as arguments the length of the chain and the body of the innermost function in the chain:</p>
<pre><code>def make_chain(length_, body) do
  Enum.reduce(1..length_, body, fn x, acc -&gt;
    {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[{:"arg#{x}", [], nil}], acc]}]}
  end)
end
</code></pre>
<p>Or better, use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#generate_unique_arguments/2"><code>Macro.generate_unique_arguments/2</code></a> to generate the list of parameters for us:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule Func do
  def make_chain(length_, body) do
    length_
    |&gt; Macro.generate_unique_arguments(nil)
    |&gt; Enum.reverse() # Without this, the outermost function would get the last argument, which could make things confusing
    |&gt; Enum.reduce(body, fn arg, acc -&gt;
      {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[arg], acc]}]}
    end)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#to_string/2"><code>Macro.to_string/1</code></a> to check if this works as expected:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; Macro.to_string(make_chain(2, "Foo"))
"fn arg1 -&gt; fn arg2 -&gt; \"Foo\" end end"
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect! 🎉</p>
<p>We have one thing left to do before we can start rewriting <code>curry</code>: we need to generate the AST to call <code>fun</code>. This is actually pretty easy:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; quote do: fun.(a, b)
{{:., [], [{:fun, [], Elixir}]}, [], [{:a, [], Elixir}, {:b, [], Elixir}]}
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Macro.html#generate_unique_arguments/2"><code>Macro.generate_unique_arguments/2</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Function.html#info/2"><code>Function.info/2</code></a> to get the arity of <code>fun</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; fun = &amp;Map.get/2
iex&gt; {:arity, arity} = Function.info(fun, :arity)
iex&gt; params = Macro.generate_unique_arguments(arity, nil)
iex&gt; Macro.to_string({{:., [], [{:fun, [], nil}]}, [], params})
"fun.(arg1, arg2)"
</code></pre>
<h2>Evaluating the AST</h2>
<p>We now know how to generate the AST for our curried function. For the next step, we need to figure out how to use it!</p>
<p>If you're scared of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#defmacro/2"><code>defmacro/2</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#unquote/1"><code>unquote/1</code></a>, don't worry. We don't need any of that. Everyone knows macros are scary.</p>
<p>You know what's not scary? <em>Runtime evaluation!</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#eval_quoted/3"><code>Code.eval_quoted/2</code></a>, we should finally be able to write our <code>curry</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule Func do
  def curry(fun) do
    {:arity, arity} = Function.info(fun, :arity)
    params = Macro.generate_unique_arguments(arity, nil)
    body_ast = {{:., [], [{:fun, [], nil}]}, [], params}

    {curried_fun, _} =
      params
      |&gt; Enum.reverse()
      |&gt; Enum.reduce(body_ast, fn arg, acc -&gt;
        {:fn, [], [{:-&gt;, [], [[arg], acc]}]}
      end)
      |&gt; Code.eval_quoted(fun: fun)

    curried_fun
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; curried_sum = Func.curry(fn x, y -&gt; x + y end)
#Function&lt;...&gt;
iex&gt; curried_sum.(1).(2)
3
iex&gt; Func.curry(&amp;Map.get/2).(%{foo: "bar"}).(:foo)
"bar"
</code></pre>
<p>It does! 🎉
Who needs macros??</p>

    <p>Someone asked me about this very recently so I felt it
    was worth writing out my thoughts in more detail. Note that
    this isn’t a manifesto, or a declaration, its just an
    effort to start putting some structure on my thoughts.</p>

    <h2 id="thehistory">The History</h2>

    <p>Since Richard Stallman wrote his GNU Manifesto<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" name="fnref:1">[1]</a> in the mid–1980s, it has come to
    be regarded as the ur-text of Free and Open Software. The
    principles enunciated were later expanded upon and codified in
    the Free Software Definition<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" name="fnref:2">[2]</a>, and
    have been adopted, to varying degrees, by different
    organisations, like Debian’s Free Software
    Guidelines<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" name="fnref:3">[3]</a> and the OSI’s
    Open Source Definition<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" name="fnref:4">[4]</a>. Before
    I continue, its probably a good idea to restate the “Four
    Freedoms” of the FSD:-</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any
      purpose</li>

      <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it
      so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source
      code is a precondition for this.</li>

      <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
      neighbor.</li>

      <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified
      versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole
      community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to
      the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While these are each expressed as <em>positive</em>
    freedoms, when the Four Freedoms (I’ll refer to these as
    4F from here, and call the individual Freedoms by number, e.g.
    4F0) were adopted by Debian and OSI, there was a distinct shift
    from positive freedoms to <em>restrictive</em> freedoms - most
    particularly the requirements that the software license:-</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>No Discrimination Against Fields of
      Endeavor</em></dt>

      <dd>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of
      the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it
      may not restrict the program from being used in a business,
      or from being used for genetic research.</dd>

      <dt><em>Distribution of License</em></dt>

      <dd>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to
      whom the program is redistributed without the need for
      execution of an additional license by those parties.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="theoriginalsins">The Original Sins</h2>

    <p>There are two separate, albeit related, problems which
    underlie these apparently positive definitions: Individualism
    &amp; Capitalism.</p>

    <p>In each case, be it the 4F, DSG or the OSI, all positive
    rights are expressed purely in <em>individual</em> terms. There
    are no collective rights in these documents, just individual
    rights. The ideal of the developer as an individual is
    hard-coded into the DNA of the Free Software Movement and its
    various children.</p>

    <p>There are various reasons for this; Stallman’s
    original tracts, for example, idealise his struggles with the
    collapse of the “social club” of MIT’s AI Lab
    and emphasise his private struggles against the loss of his
    community, these experiences are the cornerstone of his
    personal identity. Bruce Perens, father of the Debian Project,
    holds to the peculiar American cult of the Individualist
    Libertarian, as does Eric Raymond, the programmer/chronicler
    who devised the Open Source concept with Perens in the late
    1990s - free software without the freedom.</p>

    <p>It is important to remember that the American version of
    Libertarianism, as espoused by Ayn Rand and her ideologues, is
    nothing to do with the Franco-European tradition of
    libertarianism, a spectrum of leftist anarchism running from
    Babeuf through Déjacque to Faure. American
    Libertarianism should more accurately be described as
    “anarchist-capitalism”, a strain of
    pseudo-political thought which idolises the popular concept of
    the Old West as a high-point of western civilisation, when men
    were men and justice as dispensed from the barrel of a gun.</p>

    <p>It is notable that the sole non-individual right enunciated
    in the DSG and the OSD is that of the
    <strong>corporation</strong>. Perens and Raymond were certainly
    motivated by the tenets of capitalism, the primary purpose of
    their “Open Source Definition” was the packaging up
    of “Free Software” to make it acceptable to
    capitalists and rent-seekers of every stripe. Their
    collaborators in this, most notably Brian Behlensdorf and Larry
    Augustin, later seamlessly transitioned to the burgeoning
    Venture Capitalist industry.</p>

    <p>Be it as a result of accident, as with Stallman, or of
    design, as with Perens/Raymond <em>et al</em>, these designers
    of the “Holy Texts” of Free and Open Software
    applied no value to the concepts of Community and Commons.</p>

    <p>To look again at 4F3 &amp; 4F4, the Freedoms described are
    explicitly the Freedom for the Individual Programmer to decide
    whether to share his value-added programs with his community.
    More than that, in his detailed expansion on the Freedoms,
    Stallman is at pains to explain that his Freedoms do not
    enforce any <em>obligation</em> upon the Individual Programmer
    to release <em>his</em> works. In fact, in his expanded notes,
    Stallman entitles 4F3 <em>“The freedom to redistribute,
    <strong>if you wish</strong>”</em>:-</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them
privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If
you do publish your changes, you should not be required to notify anyone in
particular, or in any particular way.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Again, the entire emphasis of Stallman’s concept of
    Freedom rests on the specific rights of the Individual.
    Stallman, moreover, is the “hardcore” of this
    movement, the supposedly non-commercial member of the group.
    The emphasis placed here on the right to not distribute if you
    wish may seem trivial, however, it is central to the overall
    failure of Free and Open Source Software.</p>

    <h2 id="theresultingproblems">The Resulting Problems</h2>

    <p>Today, some 35 years after Stallman’s 4Fs, we can see
    that Free and Open Source Software is, in almost all
    conceivable ways, triumphant. It has won its struggles against
    Microsoft, it is the core of almost all smartphones, it lies at
    the heart of the networked world we all inhabit.</p>

    <p>Amidst all this glory, however, there is something utterly
    broken about the FOSS world. In short, it is one-sided, devoid
    of economic rights, and an active agent in the oppression of us
    all.</p>

    <p>As a result of the underlying assumptions and conceptions of
    the FOSS movement, there is no methodology to <em>require</em>
    the sharing of changes and improvments with the commons. The
    entire focus of the FOSS movement is specifically geared
    towards individual rights, the focus of the Open-Source
    movement is on ensuring that coporations can freely take the
    product of individual labour and profit from it.</p>

    <p>Because of Stallman’s original sin, there is no
    accepted structure within the FOSS world wherein such
    obligation to share changes can be enforced by the originator
    of a piece of software. The DSG, in fact, specifically requires
    this as a <em>precondition</em> for inclusion in its
    repositories.</p>

    <p>This means that improvements in software, bug-fixes,
    security-patches and the like, remain the absolute property of
    the person who has made them, despite the fact that they are,
    in Newton’s words, <em>“standing on the
    shoulders”</em> of those who came before. The originator
    of the software, in other words, is someone who can count
    herself lucky to be afforded the “exposure” which
    may come from the future sale of her works by a more powerful
    entity. The entire function of FOSS is for developers to
    provide the fruits of their labour, either without recompense
    or for fractional recompense, to others.</p>

    <p>The individual programmer has the rights afforded them by
    the 4Fs and the OSD, but those rights are inherently solitary.
    What possibility can there be to enforce those rights, limited
    as they may be, against the powerhouses of our gilded age? What
    economic rights accrue to our developers, the people who, in
    Stallman’s conception, are the origin point of the FOSS
    movement?</p>

    <p>Two recent and pertinent examples can be examined to provide
    answers: Heartbleed, the security vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    Library; and GitHub.</p>

    <p>OpenSSL, a software library used to secure communications
    against eavesdropping, was (until Heartbleed) primarily written
    by one person, Stephen Henson. The OpenSSL Foundation, who
    employed him, had never had more than $1m in annual funding,
    and this funding was obtained almost exclusively through
    third-party contract work which focused on specific deliverable
    product, <strong>not</strong> on the <em>“fundamental
    maintenance and development activities like releases
    management, code review and refactoring, performance and
    security, etc.”</em><a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" name="fnref:5">[5]</a> The
    beneficiaries of OpenSSL’s public nature had donated, on
    average, some <strong>$2,000</strong> a year for this critical
    piece of software.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" name="fnref:6">[6]</a></p>

    <p>The Heartbleed, vulnerability, when it became known, was a
    disaster of almost unimaginable proportions. Entire sectors of
    the internet were vulnerable to this exploit thanks to their
    reliance on this crucial underfunded piece of software.
    Companies like Amazon Web Services (annual sales, $5.11bn),
    Stripe (market valuation, $245bn) and Cisco Systems (annual
    income, $50bn) were exposed.</p>

    <p>That’s not just standing on the shoulders,
    that’s standing on the shoulders while the owner of the
    shoulders is five feet under water. To a great extent, the
    people who write FOSS software don’t even see this as a
    problem, they’re happy to have someone shoving them under
    the water.</p>

    <p>Take, as a different example, GitHub - the repository of
    much of the FOSS world’s source code. Its entire business
    model is predicated on the willingness of creators to share the
    product of their …</p></div></div>

<p>Welcome to The Embedded Rust Book: An introductory book about using the Rust
Programming Language on "Bare Metal" embedded systems, such as Microcontrollers.</p>
<h2><a href="#who-embedded-rust-is-for" id="who-embedded-rust-is-for">Who Embedded Rust is For</a></h2>
<p>Embedded Rust is for everyone who wants to do embedded programming while taking advantage of the higher-level concepts and safety guarantees the Rust language provides.
(See also <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">Who Rust Is For</a>)</p>
<h2><a href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>The goals of this book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get developers up to speed with embedded Rust development. i.e. How to set
up a development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share <em>current</em> best practices about using Rust for embedded development. i.e.
How to best use Rust language features to write more correct embedded
software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a cookbook in some cases. e.g. How do I do mix C and Rust in a single
project?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This book tries to be as general as possible but to make things easier for both
the readers and the writers it uses the ARM Cortex-M architecture in all its
examples. However, the book doesn't assume that the reader is familiar with this
particular architecture and explains details particular to this architecture
where required.</p>
<h2><a href="#who-this-book-is-for" id="who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book is For</a></h2>
<p>This book caters towards people with either some embedded background or some Rust background, however we believe
everybody curious about embedded Rust programming can get something out of this book. For those without any prior knowledge

<h2><a href="#how-to-use-this-book" id="how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</a></h2>
<p>This book generally assumes that you’re reading it front-to-back. Later
chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters may
not dig into details on a topic, revisiting the topic in a later chapter.</p>
<p>This book will be using the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html">STM32F3DISCOVERY</a> development board from
STMicroelectronics for the majority of the examples contained within. This board
is based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture, and while basic functionality is
the same across most CPUs based on this architecture, peripherals and other
implementation details of Microcontrollers are different between different
vendors, and often even different between Microcontroller families from the same
vendor.</p>
<p>For this reason, we suggest purchasing the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html">STM32F3DISCOVERY</a> development board
for the purpose of following the examples in this book.</p>

<p>Identity politics has become one of the, if not <em>the</em>, predominant markers of American politics during the past ten years. Previously relegated to the extremes of the political spectrum, it has now come to encompass mainstream political discourse and has come to define, not only the political playing field, but also social and economic life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Google encourages people to make online purchases based on the pigmentation of online business owners’ skin, you can be sure that identity politics has reached a tipping point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However honorable you may think the goals of certain strains of identity politics may be (whether left, right, or middle), or however important you think certain tactical victories made possible by identity politics are, in the long run, as they say, it all ends in tears.</p>



<p>While identity politics was once primarily the purview of the American left, it has now infected the right as well. While once the banner of racial solidarity and sexual identity was raised in the name of progressivism, it now flies over the ranks of the reactionary, traditionalist right. As should have been expected. Both are equally cancerous for American government and society.</p>



<p>And now we have a culture war where the battlelines (racial, sexual, cultural, and national) are drawn in such a way that it is impossible to defect to one or the other side without being burned at society’s stake, no matter how good your intentions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, neoliberalism itself bears much of the blame. In a (deeply misguided) effort to enact equality, neoliberalism claims that people are, or should be, entirely free of any socially distinguishing characteristics and context. Neoliberalism claims that background, history, family, faith, and culture should have no extant claim on the individual. In this way, neoliberalism suppresses human individuality. And, as is the case when something is suppressed, reactions to the suppression are often overdone and unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identity itself is not the problem. Far from it. Identity is essential to humanity. Rather, it is identity <em>politics</em> that is the root of this current evil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Politics is the process of collective action. In order to act collectively, people need to feel common cause with others. That is, they need to form groups based on some shared desire or belief. This is normally a normal and healthy, if somewhat contentious, process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, when the common cause around which people congregate is identity, you have a problem. This is because, even on the extreme left—being possessed, as it is, by doctrinaire relativism—identity is nonetheless viewed as more or less “essential,” or even immutable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it may seem a contradiction, the identitarian left views identity as biological and essential in cases of race and culture (i.e., your skin color and history) on the one hand, while simultaneously viewing identity as a matter of personal preference in the case of sexuality (i.e., your gender and who you are attracted to). Either way, identity is viewed as essential or immutable and unchangeable by society. Hence the negative reactions on the left to racial/cultural appropriation and conversion therapy.</p>



<p>Identity is also problematic as a common cause for collective action on the identitarian right. Here, identity is viewed as equally essential and immutable. In the case of the right, the basis for identity is nativism and culture (i.e., your country of birth and your history). Hence the negative reactions on the right to immigration and non-Christian religion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In either case, the cause for collective action in identity politics is not purely shared sentiment, but essential and immutable identity. In other words, the side you belong to is predetermined. Deserters can and will be shot (c.f. RINOs and Uncle Toms). This is, of course, a formula for political (and social) disaster. In Rwanda, Srebrenica, and Nazi-controlled Europe, as well as throughout history, it led to genocide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It should be noted, though, that the problem with identity politics is not <em>identity</em> as such, but rather the need to create identities that are large enough to enable collective action. By creating large identity groups through evoking large-scale identifiers such as race, religion, culture, etc., you not only create “us” and “them,” but you necessarily emphasize one or two aspects of peoples’ identities, while downplaying others, all in the name of unity.</p>



<p>In other words, the process of identity politics renders individual identity invisible, to use the leftist terminology. Which is ironic considering the emphasis the left places on how racial, cultural, and sexual identity are rendered invisible by the “white, male patriarchy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But whether identity politics divides people based on race, sexual identity, intersectionality, nationality, or religion, the result is the same; <em>true </em>diversity and <em>true</em> individuality are suppressed, erased, and made invisible. All in the name of “the cause.”</p>



<p>Which is sad, because individuals are <em>so</em> much more than a caricatured composite of how they look, who they are attracted to, and where they were born. In other words, the <em>identity</em> of identity politics doesn’t go <em>nearly far enough</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Of course</em>, race, sexuality, and the country, culture, and religion in which we are born, make up part of who we are. But so do our other genes and phenotypes, our individual personalities, our highly idiosyncratic and eclectic values, beliefs, preferences, attitudes, behaviors, quirks, and, of course, the <em>choices</em> we make independent of all of these.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liberalism—at least as it was classically understood (c.f. Kant, Locke, etc.)—was revolutionary because it placed a unique and immutable value on <em>the individual</em>. Not the individual’s race, sexuality, religion, or place of birth, but <em>the individual as such</em>, recognizing each as unique and uniquely valuable. Full stop. Identity politics suppresses this fact in the pursuit of political power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the napalm of political tools, the use of identity politics, whatever its intended ends, should be categorically rejected by all ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>We already had one instance of Bitcoin being artificially manipulated upwards, in 2013, and most people who bought in got screwed. At the time, the fraud was happening on MtGox, an exchange that was processing over half of all trading volume, and was in a position to manipulate the market.</p>



<p>Today, over 70% of Bitcoin trading is happening against USDT, a stablecoin that’s being printed out of thin air at an exponential rate. People who are still buying Bitcoin with real dollars, now that everyone has understood the scheme, are simply the greatest fools who allow the scammers to cash out, right before the collapse.</p>



<h3>The best performing asset in the world</h3>



<p>If you think Bitcoin is the best performing asset right now, think again. You’re going to kick yourself for missing this one:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45.png 999w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45-300x159.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-18.31.45-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px"></figure>



<p>Yes, it’s a one year chart, and the asset in question is really up 2,300,000% over the last year. That’s two million three hundred thousand percent ARR. And it’s not some unknown painting that turned out to be a Da Vinci, that only an insider could buy before it mooned. No, it’s a stock index, everything is legit, the chart is from Bloomberg. And I can guarantee you that if you buy in today, you’re still early. It will continue to moon next year as well.</p>



<p>The chart above is that of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBVC:IND">Caracas Stock Exchange Stock Market Index</a>. You might have noticed that it’s denominated in VES, or Venezuelan Peso, a currency that’s going to lose half its value before the end of the day, as a result of relentless money printing by the Venezuelan central bank.</p>



<p>You can check the stock prices of any country with high inflation – from Zimbabwe to Argentina – and you’ll notice the same pattern, over and over again. “Money printer goes brrr” makes asset prices denominated in that currency go to the moon, and it’s never too late to join the party.</p>



<p>Obviously investing in Venezuelan or Zimbabwean equities won’t make you a billionaire in a few month’s time. The falling value of the currency will offset the gains, and you’ll end up holding some rather illiquid stocks that will be worth… probably something, but not billions of US dollars.</p>



<p>In the past, Venezuelan government officials tried to hide this reality by setting an “official” rate for the peso against the US dollar. Of course, you couldn’t buy any dollars with your pesos at that rate, but for someone who wasn’t paying attention, it might have looked like things weren’t that bad. </p>



<p>You could, of course, buy pesos with your dollars at that rate, but nobody was that stupid. Venezuelans knew the truth, because they were witnessing that the value of the peso was plummeting: a bag of carrots at the market would cost a thousand of pesos one day, and two thousands the day after, and so forth.</p>



<h3>A Potemkin village of a market</h3>



<p>But what if you couldn’t buy anything with your pesos, but the stock market? What if the Venezuelan government had such a tight grip on appearances, and on places that traded the peso, that you wouldn’t know the truth, at least for a while? You’d only see a chart that’s mooning, and only hear about people buying in because it was mooning, and those people would seem to be making stupid amounts of money day after day.</p>



<p>If you think this is impossible, google “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bots-drove-bitcoins-150to1000-rise-2013-paper/">Willy Bot</a>“. At the time, the online exchange MtGox was an absolute leader in Bitcoin trading, with over half of all worldwide trading volume. You would wire your dollars to MtGox, receive MtGox credits in your account, that everyone believed to be worth their face value in USD, and buy Bitcoin with them. Bitcoin went up as if on steroids, and nobody questioned the goose that laid golden eggs.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404.jpg 728w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coindesk-bpi-chart-86-728x404-300x166.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></figure>



<p>Until too many people tried to cash out, and MtGox went bust. You might notice that the price of Bitcoin didn’t crash that much afterwards, for the very simple reason that the exchange froze everyone’s accounts. Nobody was allowed to access their Bitcoins once the truth was out. Bitcoin not crashing to zero is little solace when you lost yours.</p>



<p>This was the exact same scenario as described with the imaginary all-powerful Venezuelan government – a central party (MtGox a.k.a. the Venezuelan government) that’s able to distort the perception of reality and print its way to the moon, attracting hordes of wannabe millionaires. Until one investor too many try to cash out and everything collapses.</p>



<h3>Fool me once…</h3>



<p>Surely that couldn’t happen again, people aren’t THAT stupid, right?</p>



<p>Well, it’s happening again. Over <a href="https://blog.kaiko.com/tether-vs-usd-is-a-dollar-a-dollar-when-it-comes-to-trading-4632380f4284">70% of Bitcoin is traded against USDT</a>, a stablecoin that’s being printed at an exponentially growing rate:</p>

<p>There are no basis for believing that USDT tokens are worth anything. USDTs are issued by Tether, a shady company whose legally declared office doesn’t exist, and that’s being investigated by the NYAG for fraud. Legally, USDTs are worthless: only a few selected secret parties can ask to redeem them for US dollars, and even then, Tether has the right to delay the redemption requests for as long as they want:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05.png 740w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-19.27.05-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>You cannot buy anything with USDTs but cryptocurrencies – mainly Bitcoin. There is no reason to believe that USDTs aren’t printed out of thin air: Tether has systematically failed to provide an audit of its reserves, and they won’t even say what those reserves are. <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/the-great-tether-bitcoin-collateral-flippening/">Cryptocurrency macro flows show that USDTs are most probably backed by Bitcoins themselves</a>, meaning that USDTs are issued to buy Bitcoin, thus pumping Bitcoin’s price.</p>



<p>The problem with USDTs being backed by Bitcoins is that Bitcoin can’t fall, or USDTs will no longer be properly backed, and exchanges will panic. This forces Tether to keep printing ever more USDTs to pump Bitcoin’s price, in an exponential race to the death until exchanges can no longer maintain the USDT peg because people who made millions of paper gains try to cash out – albeit a little bit, and everyone realises USDTs were just a fancy version of the Venezuelan peso.</p>



<p>However, as long as the day is young and there are more real USD buyers than USD sellers, the scammers can cash out for real dollars. The mechanics of the scheme are simple:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32.png 657w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-12-at-20.47.32-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></figure>



<h3>The rising price fallacy</h3>



<p>With Bitcoin going up by 20% every month, a lot of people might be tempted to think, “hey, even if it’s a Ponzi scheme, it only needs to go on for a few more months and I’ll double my money, and then I’ll cash out before it collapses”.</p>



<p>But that’s the thing with fake markets – most people lose all their money, because most people don’t manage to cash out before the scheme collapses. The moment the inflows of USDs start to dwindle, the scammers close shop and disappear. Remember – these scammers have painstakingly put the scheme together with only one goal: get as much real dollars as possible, by selling you Bitcoins they’ve purchased with worthless tokens. They will not give a penny of their loot back, the moment they think their scheme is unraveling.</p>



<p>If you aren’t an insider, you have no way of knowing when that will happen, so your decision of buying in or cashing out is taken randomly. If you don’t have any insider information, you become part of the statistic. And statistics say that 99% of people will lose everything, and that you will almost certainly be in that 99%.</p>



<p>The rising price fallacy is the misconception that the longer a scheme goes up in price, the lower are the chances of it crashing in the near future. The reality is the exact opposite: the scheme has to suck in a lot of fools to establish that upward price chart, and by the time you, a random person with no inside information, has noticed it, most people are already invested, and you’ll just be part of the final herd.</p>



<p>Of course everybody thinks that they’re special, that they’re not part of the herd, that they’re smarter than the rest. That’s why the scam works. Because people need to rationalise the fact that they’re smarter than the rest, the founding pillar of Bitcoin communication is, “you’re still early”, and “more people are coming”. Much has been said about Tesla buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. But nobody is talking about the fact that someone has SOLD Tesla $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Why has someone sold $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin? Weren’t THEY aware of the fact that Bitcoin can only go up?</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes.jpg 540w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emperors-New-Clothes-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"></figure>



<p>Nobody is talking about the crash to come, precisely because everyone invested knows that it’s a manipulated market, and they are hoping to cash out before the others. So the last thing everyone wants to do, is say anything that might make the other investors doubt, which could make those investors think about cashing out before they do. The tale of Emperor’s New Clothes is as old as civilization itself.</p>



<p>The endgame is simple: for everyone who is buying in, people are cashing out. Those who are cashing out, are part of the 1% who won’t lose it all. Statistically, you aren’t part of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I got fed up with macOS. While the new hardware(Apple Silicon) got amazing feedbacks, the OS itself
is so lag behind.</p>

<p>I got a Windows 10 desktop at home and heck, it was event much more pleasant to use than using macOS.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a typical user (web browsing, mail and office stuff), Windows 10 is very good.</li>
  <li>As a developer, it’s getting a lot better with WSL/Microsoft Terminal/etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to give Linux another evaluation test. I pick Manjaro - an Arch-based over an Ubuntu-based 
distro this time after hearing all kind of praise from its users. But I also don’t want to configure
everything I need to use, hence Manjaro.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manjaro is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch operating 
system. Within the Linux community, Arch itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, 
powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge - and 
bleeding edge - software. However, Arch is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded 
users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical 
expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</p>

  <p>via <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/About_Manjaro">wiki.manjaro.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So looks like it got the best of both worlds right?</p>

<h2 id="the-test-setup">The test setup</h2>

<p>I built a new mini PC recently. It’s the Asrock Deskmini X300W that use AMD processor. If you prefer
Intel, you can choose the Intel version of the box.</p>

<p>I went with AMD because I like their Zen offering and I would love to support them.</p>

<p>I just throw a 6 cores AMD 4650G processor, 32GB of 3200Mhz Crucial memory, 512GB Samsung NVME drive for 
OS and other stuff plus another 1TB 2.5’ SSD for storage.</p>

<p>For OS, I went with Manjaro KDE variant because I like the look of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-experience">The experience</h2>

<p>Almost everything works out of the box.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The graphic works right. I do not have an Intel GPU so it’s much easier for me but I hear 
terrifying stories from other side of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WiFi works. Zero complaints here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bluetooth is almost ok. Most stuff I throw at it works, except an old Xbox One controller of
mine. The one came with Xbox One S works with 1 minor additional step (disable ERTM). I tested with
4 bluetooth mouses, 2 keyboards, 1 speaker and 2 Xbox controllers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I pick KDE, it’s a bit troublesome to use setup i3 wm. After reading several tutorials, I 
decided not to bother with one. Instead, I settled with 
<a href="https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite">krohnkite</a> plugin for KWin. It works really well for my needs
, given that my needs are pretty basic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do gaming once in awhile and Manjaro even came bundled with Steam (LOL). One might say it’s so
bloat but I’m ok. Storage is cheap these days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developer experience is awesome. Linux is usually first-class platform for open source projects.
Everything just works. Docker is so fast because no VM required. It’s the best platform for 
developers, hands down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So far, I’m loving it. It does everything I need and works with all the peripherals I have, 
with the exception of the Xbox One controller (wired connection still work though). I’m gonna stick with
Manjaro for now. I don’t see myself moving to Arch since my love for tweaking the system is long
gone. I just want something that works and Manjaro does work very well for me.</p>

<p>Jerry Brown was the governor of California from 1975 to 1983 and again from 2011 to 2019. He was also the mayor of Oakland from 1999 to 2007 and California’s attorney-general from 2007 to 2011. He recently cofounded the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>Stewart Brand is a writer and was the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog and of CoEvolution Quarterly. He cofounded the Long Now Foundation in 1996.</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p><em>This conversation was facilitated by Noema deputy editor Nils Gilman.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Governor Brown, how did you first formulate the idea of planetary realism?</p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>It happened in a mundane way. I was running for president in 1976, and I was formulating some ideas on foreign policy. As I discussed these issues with knowledgeable people, I thought of the world as being deeply interconnected. I had the sense that it wasn’t just “us against them,” but rather that there was connectivity among all nations across a range of issues.</p>



<p>On the one hand, I wanted to be realistic: hard-boiled, not getting carried away with utopianism. That’s the realistic side: Morgenthau, Machiavelli, Kissinger. But on the other hand, I wanted to add a dose of humanism and romanticism as well. I wanted to combine realism with some more thoughtful ideals, reflecting something more caring. So, I took the word “realism” and put it together with “planetary,” because this was the early part of the environmental movement — the <span data-note="The Stockholm Conference was among the United Nations’ first major international environmental symposiums.">Stockholm Conference</span> had just happened in 1972.</p>



<p>Back then, I wasn’t thinking about climate change, but rather of the sea and of nuclear war. I argued that we had to see the big picture — you might call it the “whole Earth perspective,” as opposed to nationalism and the politics of scapegoating. We can’t let nationalism run away with us — we have to think of the interests we share. Today, that includes the shared vulnerability to viruses, cyber-attacks and climate change.</p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>With that frame in mind, how has your thinking about planetary realism changed over the last four decades?</p>



<p><strong>Brown: </strong>My concern about blindness and beliefs has intensified. I’m taken with how strong beliefs are, and I don’t say that in a positive way: Recent politics has become the collision of beliefs.</p>



<p>I’ve become impressed with the lack of this thing called “reason.” I used to think that, overall, we’re reasonable people. But now I think we’re all belief people. We’re not fact-based — we’re belief-based. I think of the end of the poem “Dover Beach” by Matthew Arnold:</p>



<div><p>And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p></div>



<p>I look out today and see a lot of what I would call ignorant armies clashing by night. The result is that I have become more minimalist in my assertions. As a governor, I had to decide things all the time, and I didn’t always have time to probe too deeply. Therefore, I decided to go after things where I thought it was pretty clear what we needed to do, like climate change and prison reform.</p>



<p>On most things, we either aren’t clear or we don’t have the time or inclination to get to the bottom of them. I would say that today I know more, including that the universe is much bigger than I realized. So, I’d say a bit of humility has entered the picture.</p>



<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Stewart, does your trajectory around “whole Earth thinking” mirror the governor’s on planetary realism? Where did the idea of the “whole Earth” come from to begin with?</p>



<p><strong>Brand: </strong>For me, it began in 1966, right after the <span data-note="The Trips Festival was a weekend-long, LSD-infused, immersive arts and music experience in San Francisco in January 1966 that is now recognized as a landmark moment in the early hippie counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s.">Trips Festival,</span> which I had helped to organize. On the roof of my apartment in San Francisco, I had an LSD-laced vision where I asked myself, “What am I going to do for humanity?” And looking up, I thought: If we saw a plausible photograph of Earth from outer space, ideally in color and ideally of the whole globe, not just one section of it, that could make a difference. I started promoting that, handing out buttons that asked, “Why haven’t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?” When that photo was finally published, it provided the cover for the Whole Earth Catalog. For me, the whole Earth has been a frame that directed attention toward things we might otherwise not take seriously.</p>



<p>So, when Jim Lovelock and Lynn Margulis proposed the <span data-note="The Gaia hypothesis suggests that all living matter on Earth forms a synergistic complex system, likened to a single organism, regulating the conditions for life.">Gaia hypothesis</span> in the early 70s, CoEvolution Quarterly, which I was then editing, was one of the first places to print it and then print a debate about it. At the time, a lot of biologists were pretty skeptical, even hostile, to the Gaia hypothesis. A scientist up in Canada named W. Ford Doolittle wrote to me and said something like, “Gaia is an intriguing idea and idealistic, but it makes no sense in terms of evolution, because if the Earth is supposedly adapting, what is it adapting in relation to? You can’t have a species of one individual. Fitness only makes sense in relation to other individuals. But with Gaia, there are no other individuals.” Doolittle and Lovelock went back and forth, and I printed that.</p>

  </div>
</div>




<p>But here’s an update: Just last year, Doolittle published an <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-gaia-hypothesis-reimagined-by-one-of-its-key-sceptics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">essay</a> saying, “You know what, I think Lovelock and Margulis were right.” He revised his thinking about how evolution works to account for what you might call group selection, outside of the individual, to include whole arrays of things. His piece looked at “nested arrays,” all the way up to the whole Earth as itself a nested array of various forces. One of the things he notices is an idea very much in line with the Long Now Foundation, which is the persistence of species and the persistence of individuals. In the same way, Bruno Latour and Timothy Lenton’s essay on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1066" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Gaia 2.0</a> makes the point that some systems learn how to become good at persisting — and the Earth is one of those.</p>



<p>What I see now is that human civilization is in the process of trying to become like Earth, in the sense of learning how to become a persistent system. In this century, we’re going to get a lot of harsh lessons on how not to persist — and then we will either correct that, or we won’t.</p>



<p>My particular take on COVID-19 (besides dread) is that the best thing that COVID might do for us is give global civilization a chance to think in planetary-scale terms about a problem that, like climate change, is in a sense caused by all of us and can only be solved by a large quantity of us. There are examples of handling it well, like in Taiwan or New Zealand, and handling it badly, like here and in Italy. I see a chance in this century for civilization to get out of its adolescence, to become more mature, pragmatic, skeptical and solution-oriented (rather than story-oriented) so that we can reverse planetary degradation. This won’t be like ending the Cold War. This is a new kind of problem, where people have to really <em>connect </em>in order to fix it.</p>

  </div>
</div>




<p>In the introduction to the Whole Earth Catalog in 1968, I wrote, “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” More recently, in “Whole Earth Discipline” (2009), I wrote, “We are as gods and <em>have</em> to get good at it.” What changed between those two statements is global warming, which changed the sense of who the “we” is.</p>



<p>The “we” in the Whole Earth Catalog are the individuals who were empowered to leave college and go get their own education in more interesting, exciting, inventive and creative ways than just studying for a degree. (The idea was to go out and start communes, things like that. All of them failed: Hey, we all learn our lessons!)</p>



<p>By contrast, the “we” of climate change has almost nothing to do with individuals. It’s the “we” of civilization: Civilization now has powers, godlike powers (in the sense of Greek gods, not the Christian God — we don’t have omniscience and never will).</p>

<p><strong>Brown: </strong>As I listen to Stewart, I’m reminded that one of the things that inclined me to focus was my training in the Jesuit seminary, where we were isolated in a small group to study large issues. The Jesuits call them the “last four things”: death, judgment, heaven, hell.</p>



<p>Now, I left all that behind for a number of reasons, not the least of which was skepticism, but what stayed with me was the hankering to relate to something really important. In today’s politics, I find that a lot of transient and trivial issues of the moment dominate the political imagination through the media, and in doing so, they diminish and marginalize these bigger issues we should be thinking about.</p>



<p>People say, wait, what about education funding? What about the property tax? But in relation to the larger, planetary issues, these seems like an evasion. An issue like climate change requires a different approach.</p>

<p><strong>Gilman: </strong>Governor Brown, given what you said earlier about the rootedness of people in belief rather than reason, how likely do you think it is that the public is going to be able to get there in terms of appreciating the complexity and seriousness of these planetary problems? Microbes and carbon molecules don’t care about borders. And in many ways, technological risk, like with nuclear weapons or artificial intelligence, doesn’t care about borders.</p>



<p>At the same time, however, the public and politicians still think in terms of narratives and have beliefs that in …</p></div></div>

I knew basic web development and not much more.</p><p>Since mid-2020, I've been working full-time as a data scientist, analysing Big Data with Spark, SQL and Python (for a company with $300 million annual revenue).</p><p>I built my skills alongside a full-time job as a doctor, by doing courses and projects in my free moments.</p><p>Here I'm going to share every course and project that took me from zero to a full-time technical role in just over 2 years.</p><h2 id="-what-s-the-use-of-a-project-list">📋 What's the use of a project&nbsp;list?</h2><p>This isn't a prescriptive list. Nor is it a 'how-to guide'.</p><p>Instead, I hope to:</p><ol><li><strong>Give inspiration for your own project ideas</strong></li><li><strong>Give insight into the journey of building data science + coding skills</strong></li></ol><p>I've shared project details, timelines and the rough amount of time spent on each. Of course, rate of progress depends on many factors (amount of time you can/want to put is key 🔑). I did this alongside a fairly demanding full-time job, so obviously could have made faster progress. But it was high on my priority list outside of work, so it could also have been slower.</p><h2 id="-themes-i-noticed">🎡 Themes I&nbsp;noticed</h2><p>Making this list helped me identify two themes:</p><ol><li><strong>I started with online courses but shifted to projects as soon as possible.</strong> (I'm a big believer that projects are where the real learning happens.)</li><li><strong>The projects got cooler and more complicated as time progressed.</strong> While each project builds your skills, it also helps you identify (i) what's possible and (ii) what's interesting.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="-the-journey-from-beginner-to-now">🛣 THE JOURNEY: FROM BEGINNER TO&nbsp;NOW</h2><h3 id="-1-the-javascript-road-trips-1-2-and-3-codeacademy-course-">(1) The Javascript Road Trips 1, 2 and 3 — CodeAcademy [COURSE]</h3><ul><li><strong>Date Completed: </strong>Jan — Feb 2018</li><li><strong>Time Committed: ~30 hours </strong>(roughly 2 evenings per week for 4-6 weeks)</li><li><strong>Link: </strong><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/code-school-javascript-road-trip-part-1" rel="noopener">Here</a> (now on Pluralsight).</li></ul><p>When starting off, I had no idea where to begin.

<em>2021-02-13</em><br>

<h2 id="baggins">Background</h2>

<p>
In the beginning, the CPU was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

</p><p>
Though computers have only gained in popularity, in our interactions with them we have increasingly attempted to interact less with the CPU; and more and more with the abstractions that simply <i>happen</i> to be implemented atop CPUs.
One of the earliest such abstractions was the <b>instruction set architecture</b> (ISA).
The idea was this: instead of writing code for a specific CPU, you would design an abstract specification for one; a language, if you will, that could be spoken by multiple different CPUs.
You would then write code according to that instruction set, in that language, and it could be interpreted by any CPU implementing that instruction set.
This was desirable partly because it allowed code to be written once and run multiple placesâ€”the first inklings of portability, rising!â€”but mostly because it allowed you to think only of the specification while you wrote your code, and perhaps even forget for a moment that there was a CPU underlying it all.

</p><p>Ahhh, the power of abstraction in the morning...

</p><p>
Another such abstraction was the <b>mnemonic assembler</b>.
Before the assembler was created, CPUs and ISAs were instructed using numbers which had special meaning to the ISA in question.
For example, consider the following number<sup id="b0"><a href="#f0">0</a></sup> (in octal form, for no particular reason):

</p><pre>030514</pre>

<p>
In the context of the ISA implemented by the CRAY-1<sup id="b1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, that number is understand to mean â€˜add the contents of registers A1 and A4, and store the result in register A5â€™.
The association between this numeric form and its meaning under the ISA is completely arbitrary, and serves only to remind our poor programmers that they are serving a CPU, whose native language is written with arbitrary numbers.
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if, instead of meaningless <span>030514</span>, our CPU could understand a form like this one?

</p><pre>A5	A1+A4
</pre>

<p>
(This latter form, while no less arbitrary than the other, is arbitrary in a way which matches preexisting human arbitrarinesses.
 This makes humans feel warm and fuzzy inside, like theyâ€™ve conquered a part of the machine kingdom with their superior human intellect, and is called a â€˜mnemonicâ€™.)

</p><p>
Unfortunately, while CPUs are equally capable of parsing numbers like <span>030514</span> and strings of words like <span>A5	A1+A4</span>, they are much slower at the second.
Thus, a compromise was borne: a mnemonic assembler would be a program (like all programs, it would run on a CPU implementing an ISA), and it would translate mnemonic forms like <span>A5	A1+A4</span> into machine forms like <span>030514</span>.
This allows humans to <i>pretend</i> that the CPUs understand their own native language, while still allowing the CPUs themselves to run at tolerable speeds.

</p><p>
At this point, it is worth making a couple of things devastatingly clear.

</p><p>
First, an assembler that runs on a given ISA may produce machine code for that ISA, or machine code for a completely different ISA.<!--(An assembler that produces code for a different ISA than that on which is runs is sometimes called a â€˜cross assemblerâ€™, Ã  la â€˜cross compilerâ€™.)-->
</p><p>
Second, there is almost always a 1:1 correspondence between the mnemonics inhaled by a given assembler and the instructions it spits out.  (Where there is not, the situation is generally close enough to 1:1 as to make no ends.)
</p><p>
Third, mnemonics were not standardised the same way that ISAs were.  A given set of mnemonics only works on one ISA, but there might be any number of other mnemonic-sets that also work on that ISA.  (Despite this, a number of tropes tend emerge which are shared by all mnemonic-sets targeting a given ISA.)

</p><p>
At this point, we are ready to attack the problem at hand.
</p><p>
There is a popular group of ISAs variably known as:
</p><ul>
<li>x86
 <ul><li>x86-64?
  <ul><li>EM64T?
   <ul><li>x64??
    <ul><li>AMD64???</li>
    </ul></li>
   </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
 </ul></li>
<li>IA-32
 <ul><li>IA-32<b>e</b>???</li></ul></li>
</ul>
(The question marks have been added for comedic effect.
 In point of fact, they are about as funny as the overproliferation of names that this ISA seems to accumulate in much the same way that a pile of cow dung accumulates flies or that this sentence accumulates words.
 Unlike a pile of cow dung, however, no clarity emerges when you swat it; only more confusion.
 Which being said, you should still clean your CPU at least annually; use soap, warm water, and a soft rag to get the gunk out of the transistors.)

<p>
This ill-fated ISA, which has almost as many addressing forms as names and is so immensely complicated that a you need to read a 5000-page tome<sup id="b2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> plus an additional 400 or so pages of unofficial reference before you can even begin to be qualified to understand the consequences of a single of its instructions, will henceforth be referred to as â€˜â€œSIBâ€�â€™.
I give it that name not so much to deliberately sow confusion (though that is definitely a contributing factor) as because thatâ€™s the only name that everybody seems to agree is associated with it.
(This is also the reason its name is quoted: itâ€™s the only word, indeed the only idea in this missive I didnâ€™t make up from whole cloth, ripped cloth, cheese cloth, pins, pinheads, camembert<sup id="b3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>, angels, and heads of ã�®ã�£ã�ºã‚‰ã�¼ã�†.)

</p><p>
Because â€˜SIBâ€™ is, inexplicably, enduringly popular, a lot of assemblers have been made for it.
As I mentioned, though different assemblers are not always compatible with each other, tropes and commonalities tend to emerge.
In fact, there are two incompatible sets of tropes; they are generally called â€˜AT&amp;T syntaxâ€™ and â€˜Intel syntaxâ€™, and you can read about the differences <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">here</a>.

</p><p>
...but you knew all of this already.
If Iâ€™ve done my due diligence, you were incited by the title but are still looking for something to disagree (or agree) with strongly.
Patience!

</p><p>
I contend that the AT&amp;T syntax is harmful and bad, and should never be used, for any reason, under any circumstances, by anyone.
Hereâ€™s why:


</p><h2 id="the-real-biggy">AT&amp;T syntax is broken</h2>

<p>
This is the single greatest sin perpetrated by the AT&amp;T syntax.
If not for this, it would be sufficient to say that Intel syntax were superior.
If not for this, the use of AT&amp;T syntax would be at least be acceptable, at least be moral<sup id="b4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>, even if still in supremely poor taste.
If not for this, it would be <i>possible</i> to write correct programs using the AT&amp;T syntax.

</p><p>
Now, to be clear, I donâ€™t expect advanced safety features from an assembler.
I donâ€™t expect dependent types, or linear types, or even any types at all.
<i>But I would pretty damn well appreciate it if my assembler didnâ€™t <b>actively</b> try to sabotage me!</i>


</p><p>
Let me show you an example.
Hereâ€™s an annotated snippet of Intel-style â€˜SIBâ€™ assembly:

</p><pre>mov	eax, 28            ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
mov	eax, dword [28]    ; (2) load one â€˜dwordâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, â€˜dwordâ€™ should be replaced with â€˜dword ptrâ€™, or just elided entirely)-->
</pre>

<p>
Hereâ€™s another snippet, AT&amp;T syntax this time:

</p><pre>movl	$28, %eax          ; (1) store the immediate value 28 in the EAX register
movl	(28), %eax         ; (2) load one â€˜(l)ongâ€™ (4 bytes) from memory location 28 and store it in the EAX register <!--;     (on some assemblers, the â€˜lâ€™ can be elided)-->
</pre>

<p>
Good so far?
Reasonable?
Good.

</p><p>
I present to you two more candidates, again in AT&amp;T syntax:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) ???
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) ???
</pre>

<p>
Before you continue reading, I want you to imagine what it would make <i>sense</i> for those instructions to mean.
Should they even be correct?
If you happen to already know, try to forget (pray for oblivion from the horror...)

</p><p>
If you donâ€™t know, make your best guess.

</p><p>
Ready?
Here they are again, with annotations this time:

</p><pre>movl	28, %eax           ; (3) same as (2)
movl	($28), %eax        ; (4) load one long from the memory location indicated by global symbol â€˜$28â€™ and store it in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
Wait, what?

</p><p>
Go back and read that again and tell me in what world that could possibly be okay.
Tell me in what world an assembler that silently accepts the above forms, that is almost certainly corrupting your meaning in a way you donâ€™t intend, could <i>possibly</i> produce correct code.
Tell me you would <i>never</i> forget to put a <span>$</span> in front of an immediate, and that you would never accidentally put one in a displacement.

</p><p>
This doesnâ€™t even have anything to do with Intel syntax.
This isnâ€™t a win for Intel over AT&amp;T.
This is just AT&amp;T syntax being straight-up batshit fucking bonkers for no very good reason.

</p><p>
All it would take to redeem AT&amp;T syntaxâ€”okay, maybe not redeem, but at least elevate from <i>Cocytus</i> to <i>Phlegyas</i>â€”would be to make syntaxes (3) and (4) illegal.
Thatâ€™s it.
Want to help?
Send a patch to your local AT&amp;T-style assembler to make it warn for both of those forms.
Give it a command-line flag to err instead of warning.


</p><h2>AT&amp;T is backwards</h2>

<p>
Having eaten the proverbial elephant, it is time to start addressing the smaller fry.<br>
Smaller fry: you have done an admirable job of being a thorn in my side.<br>
Reader: following are reasons why the AT&amp;T operand order is backwards.

</p><p>
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re familiar with the issue, but hereâ€™s a quick refresher.
Intel first:

</p><pre>mov	eax, ebx           ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	eax, ebx           ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
AT&amp;T:

</p><pre>mov	%ebx, %eax         ; (1) load one dword from the EBX register and store it in the EAX register
add	%ebx, %eax         ; (2) load a dword each from the EAX and EBX registers, add them together, and store the result (truncated to a dword) in the EAX register
</pre>

<p>
In general, Intel instruction mnemonics take the form â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;destination&gt;, &lt;source&gt;â€™, where AT&amp;T uses â€˜&lt;op&gt; &lt;source&gt;, &lt;destination&gt;â€™.

</p><p>
Before continuing, I want to establish a couple of things.

</p><p>
First, the consistency argument is bunk.
The consistency argument in favour of Intel syntax is illustrated by the following example:

</p><blockquote>Putting the destination first is more consistent with other, higher-level languages like C.
<span>mov eax, ebx</span> is analogous to <span>eax = ebc</span>, and <span>add eax, ebx</span> to <span>eax += ebx</span>; in general, <span>op x, y</span> is analogous to <span>x op= y</span>.</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/social_oasis.jpg"><figcaption><h4>A man looks for Bitcoin Oasis</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you have heard about blockchain or cryptocurrency, then the term that initially comes to mind is <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>. Launched 12 years ago, it was the late 2017 bull run that created a media frenzy that propelled Bitcoin into the mainstream and our modern day lexicon.</p><p>Often labeled as the “original” cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has been the catalyst (directly and/or indirectly) behind many new innovations in the blockchain and digital asset space, most notably <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>. Shortly after the late 2017 bull run lost its steam, interest in these new technologies started to fade ― but here we are in 2021 with Bitcoin having risen like a phoenix from the ashes. As you would assume, an appetite for the blockchain and digital asset space has returned and now it is more important than ever that we understand what exactly is behind this unique asset, Bitcoin.</p><p>This article is meant to be a guide for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency and want to learn about <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, specifically its use case and the different ways to become involved in the broader blockchain and digital asset space. My goal is to educate you on the basics and make sure that you walk away with a newfound perspective and understanding of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash whose transactions are recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. In late October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (whose identity is still unknown) published a white paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em></a> on bitcoin.org (registered in August 2008) and subsequently posted it to <a href="https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html">a cryptography mailing list</a>. On January 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was created when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the initial block of the chain, which is called the genesis block.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin is a decentralized type of “digital money” that can be used by anyone around the world, at any time, and without restrictions or a central authority. Bitcoin is not backed by any bank or government and originally allowed users to freely send and/or spend it anywhere without trusting third parties.</p><p>At inception, the price of Bitcoin was approximately $0.01 and, as of today, the price has surpassed $40,000 per coin ― with many believing that it can grow exponentially higher to levels between $100,000 and $250,000 in the next year or so.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_1_blockchain-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>The transactions data are memorized through a chain-of-blocks</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Given that Bitcoin exists and operates within the confounds of the Internet, all user balances are kept on an immutable and fully transparent blockchain. Put simply, each Bitcoin transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network and grouped with several other transactions in the form of a block, which the network’s miners validate. Once the block is accepted, the transactions get recorded on the blockchain (which, as you may recall, is a public ledger). Whenever this process is successfully completed, the network distributes new Bitcoin to miners for each block that has been validated ― this is referred to as a block reward.</p><p>The peculiarity of the blockchain is its distribution and decentralized properties, as all the nodes share a valid copy of the public ledger. In the Bitcoin network, nodes play a very important role ― think of them as “protectors” who are constantly monitoring Bitcoin’s blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from illegitimate ones. The basic job of a node is to prevent attempts to double-spend Bitcoins that have already been spent elsewhere. In addition, the process of mining is essential to validating transactions, as it ensures the overall trustworthiness and security of the payment network.</p><h2 id="advantages-and-limitations">Advantages and Limitations</h2><p>Members of the cryptocurrency community, who range from the tech savvy to your average retail investor, have adopted various perspectives regarding the fundamental driver of Bitcoin’s value (both in financial and non-financial terms).</p><p>On one side, there are the Bitcoin Maximalists who believe that Bitcoin is the ultimate financial innovation and will assume a mainstream role in global society ― to maximalists, other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments are inferior. On the other side, you have cryptocurrency enthusiasts who believe Bitcoin’s technology is outdated and that other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have more expansive utility.</p><p>These arguments and differences of opinion (as it relates to Bitcoin) can often become confusing, so let’s dig deeper into some of the most common discussion points with hopes that you can decipher for yourself.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>A blockchain is managed autonomously using <strong>a peer-to-peer network</strong> and cannot be shut down ― the only way to stop it is through shutting down or banning Internet access. (Note: Even though a blockchain or Bitcoin cannot be shut down, some jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on citizens that limit or ban the holding or trading of Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies.)</li><li>There is no need to trust a third party. <strong>You are your own bank!</strong></li><li>Relatively quick and cheap transactions without intermediary fees (around 10 minutes on average per transaction), when compared to most leading cryptocurrencies.</li><li>Increasing adoption by merchants and individuals across the globe.</li><li>Largest market capitalization and name recognition, which will continue to promote its growth and (hopefully) price stability.</li></ul><h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of anonymity</strong> as transactions that take place in the Bitcoin network, along with many other leading cryptocurrencies, are fully transparent and can potentially be linked via chain analysis. In addition, strict AML/KYC regulations require many of the leading cryptocurrency trading exchanges to verify your most sensitive personal information.</li><li>Slow and expensive transactions, when compared to lesser known cryptocurrencies that can be sent within seconds and at a fraction of the cost.</li><li>Irreversible transactions. Once a transaction is sent, you cannot undo or cancel the transaction.</li><li>Achievement of its status as a currency will be challenging due to its volatile nature (i.e. swings in price) and regulations.</li><li>The core technology has some subtle limits that make Bitcoin outdated in comparison with other cryptocurrencies.</li></ul><p>Along with Bitcoin Maximalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, you have many individuals who simply like to be long-term holders of Bitcoin (because they believe in the fundamentals and value proposition) and others who speculate on the short-term price (e.g. day traders).</p><p>Whatever side you are on, there is no question that Bitcoin has established itself as a serious contender in the financial world and is here to stay for the time being. There may be other alternatives, but the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies still has the spotlight!</p><h2 id="how-to-obtain-bitcoin-from-an-exchange">How to Obtain Bitcoin from an Exchange</h2><p>Now that you have an understanding of Bitcoin and its utility, you may be interested in purchasing some. If that is the case, you have come to the right place as buying it is now easier than ever due to the growing number of exchanges and companies making Bitcoin accessible to the masses.</p><p>Some of the most well-known exchanges that allow you to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com/">Kraken</a>, <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi</a>. While all of these exchanges list Bitcoin, not all of them offer the same cryptocurrencies ― so, it is recommended to open accounts across a few exchanges to ensure that you are provided adequate exposure.</p><p>Once you have created an account on an exchange, you can transfer your local fiat money via ACH or bank wire to the exchange. From there, you can purchase Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in exchange for your local fiat money. In addition, after purchasing Bitcoin, you can exchange it for another cryptocurrency that you might not be able to purchase with your local fiat money. While some exchanges offer credit card purchases of Bitcoin, please keep in mind that the fees associated with this transaction are typically very high.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/bitcoin-getting-started/extras_2_exchange-80.jpg"><figcaption><h4>You can exchange central currencies (EUR, USD) to BTC, but sacrificing privacy.</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Using any of the exchanges listed above is the easiest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin, as the majority of the other cryptocurrency exchanges do not support fiat currencies. This being the case, you can only exchange other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum or Monero) for Bitcoin. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto">PayPal</a>, some of the largest financial technology companies, offer its users the ability to purchase Bitcoin. While this is extremely convenient for users of these platforms, the downside for PayPal (not Cash App) is that your Bitcoin must remain on its platform, so you cannot transfer or send it. Remember: Not your keys, not your coins.</p><p>If you are not keen on using any of the methods described above, Bitcoin ATMs are a great alternative. There are over 14,000 physical ATMs worldwide, most of which can be found in major cities at peculiar locations such as a shopping mall, burger restaurant, or a bar. All you need to do is deposit cash and enter your Bitcoin address. Once you have completed the transaction, the funds will be sent to you. This is a very simple process and typically does not require any identity verification, but beware of high fees!</p><h2 id="who-accepts-bitcoin">Who Accepts Bitcoin?</h2><p>Over the years, many individuals and businesses have begun accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. From time to time, you might have noticed stickers on a shop’s window that says “Bitcoin accepted here.” As mentioned above, after the bull run of late 2017 died down, overall interest in cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) amongst merchants began to wane. Today, Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space has bounced back from a pricing perspective and, with this, so has the interest amongst merchants who have triggered another wave of increased acceptance, most notably <a href="https://apnews.com/article/financial-markets-elon-musk-bitcoin-061817c6795e75d1c3c9e9d6cfc4a911">Tesla</a> disclosing that it has invested approximately $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and that the company plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.</p><p>There have been a few prominent …</p></div></div>

<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, if …</p></div></div>

	<p>
I remember my own struggle with calculus at university. Limits, integrals, differential equations. Lots of practice, lots of homework. Pages and pages of exercises. I loved math, the connection between algebra and geometry, the very pleasure of solving problems by making different concepts work together. But I hated doing the “paperwork”.
	</p>
	<p>
Taking it seriously, I still studied through the semester, studied harder the week before the exam, studied even harder the night before. I got 62/100. That's 1 point above the lowest possible passing grade.
	</p>
	<p>
Well, maybe math is not for everyone. But wait a minute! The next semester I took part in the Math Olympiad, went through the faculty round, then through the university round, went to the nationals, and even managed to score a few points there. Which counted as a pass on that semester's exam.
	</p>
	<p>
Professors were proud of me. And for almost a year, they thought that the first semester's score was a mistake. Until in the third semester, I scored 65/100.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Mathematics is a lot of things. It's the fun of problem-solving, it's the excitement of discoveries, it's the pride of accomplishments, and it's a ton of tedious computations, too. I never liked that last part. I still don't. That's why I'm so happy to live in the XXI century since I can give it away to computers and still enjoy the first three.
	</p>
	<h2>
<span id="index_sympy">SymPy</span> it is
	</h2>
	<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">official site</a>:
	</p>
	<p><i>
SymPy is a Python library for <span id="index_symbolic_mathematics">symbolic mathematics</span>. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.
	</i></p>
	<p>
Symbolic mathematics? Algebra system? Sounds exclusive. Sounds like it's a tool for practicing mathematicians and the students who desperately want to become one. But it isn't. It's for practicing engineers who have just enough math knowledge to state a problem but not enough patience to solve it.
	</p>
	<p>
It does integration and differentiation. It finds limits, and it expands series. It solves equations and systems of equations. It can even do statistics. And it does it all just like you would do on an exam. It doesn't just compute numbers, it computes formulas.
	</p>
	<p>
It's a Python library that does the boring part of math for you. Moreover, it does it fast, accurately, and without angst. In other words, it is everything I'm not.
	</p>
	<h2>
Let SymPy do some math for you
	</h2>
	<p>
Let's say we want to model the sine function with a polynomial. Let's pretend we have a reason. Now how do we do that?
	</p>
	<p>
How about, we gather all we know about the sine function in one bowl and let SymPy do the rest? Sounds good?
	</p>
	<canvas id="sine" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	<p>
We know that <i>sin(0) = 0</i>, right? Everybody knows that. Also, as you might have heard, you can approximate a small sine with its own argument: <i>sin(0.001) ≃ 0.001</i>. This means that the derivative of sine in 0 is 1.
	</p>
	<p>
The sine function climbs from 0 to π/2 and then it starts going down. In π/2 it's neither climbing nor descending, it's at its peak. This means that the derivative of <i>sin(π/2)' = 0</i>. Also, since the sine only climbs to 1, <i>sin(π/2) = 1</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
The sine is symmetrical relative to π/2. This means that it descends exactly as it climbs, and at the point where it reaches full π, its derivative is <i>sin(π)' = -1</i>, and the function itself <i>sin(π) = 0</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
Also, one less known (but easily computable) fact, the integral of the sine from 0 to π/2 is 1. Let's throw this into the bowl as well.
	</p>
	<p>
So, we have 7 facts. This implies 7 equations. This implies that our polynomial will have 7 coefficients and the highest degree will be then 6.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's translate it all into Python.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_1">from sympy import *

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x = symbols('a b c d e f g x')

sine = a*x**6 + b*x**5 + c*x**4 + d*x**3 + e*x**2 + f*x + g
sine_d = diff(sine, x)
sine_i = integrate(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_i.subs(x, pi / 2) - sine_i.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, pi / 2),
    sine_d.subs(x, pi) + 1,
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, pi / 2) - 1,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d, e, f, g))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
You can browse <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html">the tutorial</a> if you like but it should be more or less clear as it is. <i>sine</i> is our polynomial model. <i>diff</i> is differentiation. <i>integrate</i> is integration. <i>solve</i> is solve. Simple! The only cryptic thing here is <i>srepr</i>. It turns the solution into a special form of expression that looks like this:
	</p>
	<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(f, 'Integer(1)') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c, 'Mul(Integer(5), Pow(pi, Integer(-5)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(288), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(19), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(1092)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d, 'Mul(Integer(10), Pow(pi, Integer(-4)), Add(Integer(-252), Mul(Integer(5), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Mul(Integer(64), pi)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a, 'Mul(Integer(28), Pow(pi, Integer(-7)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(16), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(60)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e, 'Mul(Integer(12), Pow(pi, Integer(-3)), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(8), pi), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(35)))') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(g, 'Integer(0)') <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b, 'Mul(Integer(84), Pow(pi, Integer(-6)), Add(Integer(-60), Pow(pi, Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(16), pi)))')
	</p>
	<p>
Ok, this is not really helpful. We need the coefficients and SymPy gave us the way to compute these coefficients from <i>π</i>. Well, it's what it does, it computes things symbolically not numerically. Or does it?
	</p>
	<p>
Look! I'll add one more line and SymPy will compute our coefficients as floating-point numbers.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_2">from sympy import *
from math import pi

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, x = symbols('a b c d e f g x')

sine = a*x**6 + b*x**5 + c*x**4 + d*x**3 + e*x**2 + f*x + g
sine_d = diff(sine, x)
sine_i = integrate(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_i.subs(x, pi / 2) - sine_i.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, 0) - 1,
    sine_d.subs(x, pi / 2),
    sine_d.subs(x, pi) + 1,
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, pi / 2) - 1,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d, e, f, g))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
Have you noticed which line it is? Anyway, the result is now this:
	</p>
	<p>
(f, "Float('1.0', precision=53)") <br>
(c, "Float('-0.0049207268278655082', precision=53)") <br>
(d, "Float('-0.16323406244002545', precision=53)") <br>
(a, "Float('-0.0012523393437231091', precision=53)") <br>
(e, "Float('-0.00090780192609864056', precision=53)") <br>
(g, "Float('0.0', precision=53)") <br>
(b, "Float('0.011803020246125803', precision=53)")
	</p>
	<p>
The line was <i>from math import pi</i>. This overloads the <i>pi</i> in the scope to be a floating-point number, not a symbol. And voilà — SymPy is now numeric. We can take these numbers, put them into our polynomial and it will be our model.
	</p>
	<canvas id="sine_model" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	<p>
The model works wonders in the <i>[0; π]</i> range. Outside this range it diverges from the sine but we never specified that it shouldn't.
	</p>
	<p>
The polynomial bears all the properties we told SymPy about with our equations and nothing more.
	</p>
	<h2>
Now let SymPy write some code for us
	</h2>
	<p>
Let's say we want something that looks like the sine but isn't. Something we can tweak interactively. Like the sine but with the movable middle point.
	</p>
	<p>
We can start the same way. Let's retain the point locations. The integral criterion along with the derivatives in the endpoints are better to be lifted. But that's just my opinion, you can try to retain them yourself and see what'll happen.
	</p>
	<p>
The code that states the problem looks like this:
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_3">from sympy import *

a, b, c, d, x, px, py = symbols('a b c d x px py')

sine = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d
sine_d = diff(sine, x)

the_system = [
    sine_d.subs(x, px),
    sine.subs(x, 0),
    sine.subs(x, px) - py,
    sine.subs(x, pi)
]

res = solve(the_system, (a, b, c, d))

for var, exp in res.items():
    print(var, srepr(exp))
</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
When run, it prints out that:
	</p>
	<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c, "Mul(pi, Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-1)), Symbol('py'), Add(Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(3), Symbol('px')), Mul(Integer(2), pi)), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b, "Mul(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-2)), Symbol('py'), Add(Mul(Integer(3), Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2))), Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(pi, Integer(2)))), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a, "Mul(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(-2)), Symbol('py'), Add(pi, Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), Symbol('px'))), Pow(Add(Pow(Symbol('px'), Integer(2)), Mul(Integer(-1), Integer(2), pi, Symbol('px')), Pow(pi, Integer(2))), Integer(-1)))")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d, 'Integer(0)')
	</p>
	<p>
And now it's time to get back to that cryptic <i>srepr</i> thing from before. It stands for <i>symbolic expression</i>, and it's basically a ready-made syntax tree. It's like in Lisp only with somewhat more conventional parentheses. And since it's written in conventional C-style function form, it's incredibly easy to write an interpreter for it (see: <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/cd585775b6b5176426c6a22ccbdb683b71fe62dc/pages/sympy_makes_math_fun_again.html#L336">the code on GitHub</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
For instance, here is a simple tool that turns SymPy s-expressions into runable JavaScript code.
	</p>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
Just press the button — and that's it! Of course, you can prettify the code however you like. But you can also use in raw like this (see: <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/cd585775b6b5176426c6a22ccbdb683b71fe62dc/pages/sympy_makes_math_fun_again.html#L306">the example from this very page</a>).
	</p>
	<canvas id="not_sine" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
	
	
	<p>
But the best part of it, unless you're writing in some esoteric language, you don't even need an interpreter. SymPy can print out JavaScript code from the box with a single <i>jscode</i> function! It can also print in Rust, C++, Fortran, Matematica, and more. It's <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/printing.html">already there</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
They say that AI will replace programmers in the future. Well, for a certain part, the future is here. SymPy writes your code for you. Although, when writing code means translating equations without any creative thought involved, I don't mind being replaced.
	</p>
	<h2>
Conclusion
	</h2>
	<p>
I disagree with “math is not for everyone”. Math is vast and diverse. Surely there is enough math for everyone. But some parts of it are better left to computers.

<p>Roughly three years ago we started <a href="https://instagram.com/treetalks.lk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TreeTalks</a>, it was a very simple idea, we deliver cacti, succulents and indoor plants to people who ordered them online.</p>
<p>Our main target group was people and companies who wanted to have a cacti, or an indoor plants. People who are working in offices loved to have an indoor plant to decorate their desk, companies loved to gift plants for their employees.</p>
<p>We also implemented the idea around gifting, people can gift an indoor plant to their friends, partners, friends etc. Every pot will be customised according to their needs, everything will be hand-painted, and it will include a message or a quote suggested by the user.</p>
<p>The idea was a niche one, and there was only one other similar small business who was doing somewhat similar idea. And our business grew and grew, people were happy to get an indoor plant as a gift, especially a customised one. </p>
<p>Well, you get the idea. Business was great, business was growing. Yet there was something that always bothered in the back of my mind, and I knew it was just a matter of time before the inevitable.</p>

Their brand is recognised everywhere, there is no company that does branding better than Apple.</li><li><strong>Proprietary technology – </strong>A monopoly should have a proprietary technology, for example Google. Google’s monopoly on search is built on top of their proprietary search algorithm. There is no other company in search that has an algorithm better than Google.</li><li><strong>Network effect – </strong>Something Facebook and its group of companies have in common. Even if someone else come up with a better solution, still they can’t beat Facebook because of it’s network effect.</li><li><strong>Economics of scale – </strong>Amazon is a good example for a monopoly with economy of scale. Amazon even though started out as a website to sell books online had the potential to sell just about anything they want though their website. The books were just the foot on the door, once they started expanding they had the potential to expand in to anywhere they wanted.</li></ul>
<p>So once I first read these principals by Peter Thiel, I know that my business had nothing. Three was very low barrier to entry, anyone could do it, and there was nothing proprietary in what we did, no network effect, we had nothing.</p>
<p>So what this meant was that, anyone was able to copy our business and do what we did. </p>
<h2>What copycats do</h2>
<p>For the first two years, there was no competition. People tried to come up with places that offered similar service to ours, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>But since we are living in a pandemic, and people need to find some extra income, more and more people started copying our business. And copying our business was easy, why?</p>
<ul><li>There is no barrier to entry</li><li>No one need to invest a big capital</li><li>There are were only few resources needed to get started</li><li>No special skill needed, anyone with drawing skills can do it</li><li>No propriotory technology</li></ul>
<p>Now when I scroll through Facebook and Instagram I see someone starting an instagram page or Facebook page to do exactly what we are doing.</p>
<p>And one or two copycats are easy to manage, however, just like everything else copycats also have a network effect. When a person see someone copying something, they also feel like copying it. They too want to jump in and to cash in when there is opportunity. </p>
<h2>Copycats drags the price down</h2>
<p>Copycats when there are plenty creates competition among themselves. I know that competition is a good thing, when we started TreeTalks, and when there was one other business doing the something, we had a nice completion amongst ourselves, each tried to better the other, and grab more fans on social media. But this was a healthy competition, the competition between the two pushed us to the limits and created the best versions of ourselves.</p>
<p>However, the competition that we have today, competition among copycats is not a healthy competition. It’s a fight to sell the product at the lowest price possible. And customers also want the lowest price, but there is a limit where one should not cross, and need to have a reasonable profit to the effort that you put it.</p>
<p>The same thing can be seen in freelancer platforms like Fivver and WpWork etc. Freelancers (specially from South Asia) tend to drag the price down to a point where professional developers, designers would not like to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Copycats and competition, even though is good for consumer can be bad for the growth of an industry. </strong></p>
<h2>I knew this day would come</h2>
<p>I knew this day would come, I’m happy that I created a small niche brand in our country, and made a decent income along the way. And I guess like all good business it’s time to pivot. The brand that we created, and the customers we gained must be used as the foot on the door for us to get into something better.</p>
<h2>Think before you start</h2>
<p>When you start something, always think about what Peter Thiel said. Make sure your business ticks at least one or more points of a monopoly. </p>
<p>If it does then awesome, but if it doesn’t that’s also fine. But make sure to keep it in the back of your mind that you should always be ready to pivot, or change the direction. Because copycats are coming to get you.</p>
<p>Always try to be a monopoly.</p>

"The election will now shift exclusively to voting by mail."</p>  <p>The deadline to apply for mail-in special ballots has been extended to Feb. 15.

When he dropped the writ in January, the province had a steadily low caseload.</p>  <p>As the outbreak worsened this week, Furey repeatedly defended his election timing.</p>  <p>"I haven't given much thought to the election," Furey said Friday evening, prior to Chaulk's announcement and just as news broke of B117's arrival. "I understand there are questions about the election … but we don't have the answers."</p>  <h2>Accountability ahead: opponents</h2>  <p>Fitzgerald said she has spoken with the province's chief electoral officer&nbsp;but would not disclose the advice she gave him when pressed during the briefing, saying it's not her jurisdiction.</p>  <p>Furey's opponents had been calling for an election delay this week&nbsp;and applauded the decision to move to special ballots. NDP Leader Alison Coffin expressed concern, however, that some people may face barriers&nbsp;in registering for mail-in voting by Monday.</p>  <p>"We may see some court challenges come from this," Coffin said. "What I'm more concerned about is how irresponsible Andrew Furey's actions were."</p>  <p>Progressive Conservative Leader Ches Crosbie declined an interview&nbsp;but said in a statement his party would discuss Furey's election timing "another day," saying the public health emergency is the&nbsp;priority.</p>  <p>"Our province deserves a thoughtful conversation about why it took so long for us to reach the right decision in postponing this election and how we hold our political leaders accountable," the statement read.</p>    <p>Earlier on Friday, officials reported 50 new cases of COVID-19, with the vast majority in the St. John's metro region. The province has reported&nbsp;higher-than-average new cases since Monday, when rampant community spread was first identified.</p>  <p>Thousands of people are now in isolation, including 300 health-care workers.</p>  <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador">Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador</a></strong></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

He was certain nobody could have survived the crash but was proven wrong after he saw a woman wearing no shoes in a flight attendant uniform. She actually broke a world record for surviving the highest fall of 33,000 feet without a parachute sustaining injuries to her vertebrae, 2 broken legs, broken ribs and some other injuries.</p><p>Luckily She was able to survive because the accident caused a hole in the fuselage causing a suction force to occur. It would have sucked her out had she not been pinned down by a food cart that hit her. Vesna had been recently advised against that job because of her low blood pressure but that must have been what saved her heart from bursting on impact. She sustained some levels of amnesia causing her to forget the incident and soon was caught in the sky again, working.</p><p>She went on to live her life till she died in 2016.

In February 2007, Wisnierska was practicing for the paragliding championships in Australia when she flew under a storm cloud and was sucked into it. She was flown higher into the air at a breakneck speed of 20m/s in the midst of lightning flashes and hailstones the size of ping pong balls.</p><p>Soon She passed out but the winds didn’t call it quits as she was whisked to a height of more than 32,000ft (that’s 3,000 feet higher than the peak of mount Everest and almost the cruising altitude of a commercial jet). Eventually She woke up mid air and navigated herself to a nearby farm where she only suffered frostbite to her extremities.</p><p>To show you how lucky she was to survive, experts said that this kind of luck is needed to win 10 lottery tickets in a row.</p><h2>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/4550059/bear-attack-montana-todd-orr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Orr</a></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2508" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" data-orig-size="800,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-300x188.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice.jpg 800w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/todd-orr-man-survived-grizzly-bear-attack-twice-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="People who survived the impossible 4">Lucky enough to survive a grizzly bear attack? Big deal, try two attacks in thesame day.</p><p>On September 30, 2016, Todd went hiking in the forest of Montana when he stumbled upon a grizzly bear with her Cubs. Naturally, the motherly instincts of the bear kicked up and she attacked him.</p><p>Even though he was armed with pepper spray and was able to use it, the bear still gave him some injuries before running off due to the spray. He was about to get into his car when the bear came in for round 2, obviously to finish what she started.</p><p>She ran towards him, bit his shoulder and slashed one of his arms. Fortunately, Todd was able to remain calm and lay still, protecting his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>He received a few more hits before she left him, thinking he was dead, after which he got up and drove off to the hospital.

The anaconda was badly squeezing him and boy did it hurt, BAD.</p><p>The snake initially latched on to his right arm and then quickly coiled round him. He heard strange sounds as the snake opened her mouth and started swallowing from his helmet (I guess she did swallow him from the head despite his shoulder, must have been a REALLY huge snake)</p><p>He tried to move into a more comfortable position but the snake was just too strong. It’s a good thing he called it off because even though he had a snake proof suit, he could have been crushed in a matter of time.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but getting swallowed for pictures, videos and a livestream isn’t worth it.</p></div><h2>6. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/man-impaled-air-hose-enjoying-inflated-reputation/story?id=13693534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven</a><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Health/man-impaled-air-hose-enjoying-inflated-reputation/story?id=13693534" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mcormack</a></span></h2><p><img data-attachment-id="2511" data-permalink="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/danger%e2%98%a0%ef%b8%8f/people-who-survived-the-impossible/attachment/steven-dw-bayern-whakatane-jpg0/" data-orig-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,1001" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg(0)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-300x293.jpg" data-large-file="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" loading="lazy" src="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg" alt="People who survived the impossible" width="1024" height="1001" srcset="https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0.jpg 1024w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-300x293.jpg 300w, https://www.nowyouknowstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Steven-DW-Bayern-Whakatane-jpg0-768x751.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="People who survived the impossible 7">Back in 2011, this truck driver was standing on the rigging between his truck and a trailer when one slip created a nasty chain reaction. He landed on a valve connecting the trucks brake to the compressed air supply causing it to Pierce through his Left butt and within seconds, air was released into his body in pressures of about 100PSI.</p><p>His horrified co-workers watched as he inflated to twice his size, turning him into a life sized balloon. While he screamed in agony, his co-workers managed to lift him off of the valve and place him to his side before the paramedics arrived. The air rushed in and filled the space between fat and muscle, even other places like the space between his heart and lungs and behind his eyeballs.</p><p><a href="http://<iframe  id=&quot;_ytid_20528&quot;  width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;398&quot;  data-origwidth=&quot;708&quot; data-origheight=&quot;398&quot;  src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IZQbUjrI2U?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;&quot; class=&quot;__youtube_prefs__  no-lazyload&quot; title=&quot;YouTube player&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen data-no-lazy=&quot;1&quot; data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=&quot;&quot;></iframe>" target="_blank">http://<iframe id="_ytid_91324" width="708" height="398" data-origwidth="708" data-origheight="398" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IZQbUjrI2U?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;controls=1&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></a></p><p>The nurses tried to place a needle into him but the pressure pushed the needle outside.

<p>If you have a Cisco Meraki AP with an expired cloud license, its pretty much useless. However, if you have a RaspberryPi, some wires, and some patience you can pretty easily Flash <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> on Cisco Meraki. </p>
<p><em>Disclaimer : This voids your warranty and Meraki subscription so best done on decommissioned units that have not been updated in awhile. May not work on new units.</em> </p>
<h2>Things You’ll Need </h2>
<ol><li>Cisco Meraki MR33 AP (can be done on other models with serial pins) </li><li>RaspberryPi with GPIO Board + Monitor + Keyboard + Mouse </li><li>Three Pin-To-Pin jumper wires (can be salvaged from old IDE cables) </li><li>Ethernet Cable </li><li>Torx Screwdriver and a pry tool </li><li>A Laptop and this Google Drive <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jJa8LzYnY830v3nBZdOgAk0YQK6OdbSS">Link</a> (contains the files we need) </li></ol>
<h2>Flash OpenWRT on Cisco Meraki </h2>
<p>First, remove the 4 screws (behind the rubber stoppers) on the grey underside of the AP, then pry it apart at the seams. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> There are 4 screws behind the rubber ‘feet’ on the grey side of the AP. Undo them, then pop the AP apart by using a plastic or metal knife. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>On your RaspberryPi download all of the files in the Google Drive. Extract them with a ZIP tool, then put them in a folder. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Enable Serial GPIO on the RaspberryPi by typing “raspi-config’ navigating to <strong>Interfaces -&gt; Serial -&gt; Prompt 1 Hit NO -&gt; Prompt 2 Hit YES</strong>-&gt; You will see a confirmation , hit <strong>OK -&gt; Hit Finish (bottom right)</strong></p>

<p>Take note that we will use the ttyS0 interface </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Connect these GPIO serial pins on the RaspberryPi to 3 pins on the Meraki board. </p>

<p><strong>Step 5 : </strong>Now Launch the flashing script with the following command , you need to add the name of your serial interface with the <strong>–serial={interface path}</strong>. After the python script is running and you see “Uploading image” then power on your AP to boot it ,<strong> be careful not to let the serial wires move or shift. </strong></p>
<p>If done correctly you should pretty instantly see the following output after booting the AP :</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : </strong>One the upload is done. Connect an Ethernet cord to your AP from a laptop or the Pi , set your interface IP to <strong>192.168.1.2 </strong>and your gateway to <strong>192.168.1.1</strong> with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and verify it works by pinging 192.168.1.1 , if you get a response port 21 should also be open.</p>
<p> Now Upload OpenWRT to the AP via TFTPD64 by hitting the PUT button :</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="665" height="592" src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 665w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-old-src="//roamingviews.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" data-srcset="https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 665w, https://roamingviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x267.png 300w"></figure>
<p>The AP should now Reboot after this is uploaded, wait till pings return, now you can browse to http://192.168.1.1 and see the following or SSH to see OpenWRT! </p>

<p>This document is summarised in the table below. It shows the linear models underlying common parametric and “non-parametric” tests. Formulating all the tests in the same language highlights the many similarities between them.

<div id="the-simplicity-underlying-common-tests">

<p>Most of the common statistical models (t-test, correlation, ANOVA; chi-square, etc.) are special cases of linear models or a very close approximation. This beautiful simplicity means that there is less to learn. In particular, it all comes down to <span>\(y = a \cdot x + b\)</span> which most students know from highschool. Unfortunately, stats intro courses are usually taught as if each test is an independent tool, needlessly making life more complicated for students and teachers alike.</p>
<p>This needless complexity multiplies when students try to rote learn the parametric assumptions underlying each test separately rather than deducing them from the linear model.</p>
<p>For this reason, I think that teaching linear models first and foremost and <em>then</em> name-dropping the special cases along the way makes for an excellent teaching strategy, emphasizing <em>understanding</em> over rote learning. Since linear models are the same across frequentist, Bayesian, and permutation-based inferences, I’d argue that it’s better to start with modeling than p-values, type-1 errors, Bayes factors, or other inferences.</p>
<p>Concerning the teaching of <em>“non-parametric”</em> tests in intro-courses, I think that we can justify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children">lying-to-children</a> and teach “non-parametric”" tests as if they are merely ranked versions of the corresponding parametric tests. It is much better for students to think “ranks!” than to believe that you can magically throw away assumptions. Indeed, the Bayesian equivalents of “non-parametric”" tests implemented in <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06941">literally just do (latent) ranking</a> and that’s it. For the frequentist “non-parametric”" tests considered here, this approach is highly accurate for N &gt; 15.</p>

<p>… which is a math-y way of writing the good old <span>\(y = ax + b\)</span> (here ordered as <span>\(y = b + ax\)</span>). In R we are lazy and write <code>y ~ 1 + x</code> which R reads like <code>y = 1*number + x*othernumber</code> and the task of t-tests, lm, etc., is simply to find the numbers that best predict <span>\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Either way you write it, it’s an intercept (<span>\(\beta_0\)</span>) and a slope (<span>\(\beta_1\)</span>) yielding a straight line:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Fixed correlation

</div>
<p>This is often simply called a <strong>regression</strong> model which can be extended to <strong>multiple regression</strong> where there are several <span>\(\beta\)</span>s and on the right-hand side multiplied with the predictors. Everything below, from <a href="#t1">one-sample t-test</a> to <a href="#anova2">two-way ANOVA</a> are just special cases of this system. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <strong>Spearman rank correlation</strong> is a <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> on rank-transformed <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span>\(rank(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot rank(x) \qquad \mathcal{H}_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span></p>
<p>I’ll introduce <a href="#rank">ranks</a> in a minute. For now, notice that the correlation coefficient of the linear model is identical to a “real” Pearson correlation, but p-values are an approximation which is is <a href="https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_spearman.html">appropriate for samples greater than N=10 and almost perfect when N &gt; 20</a>.</p>
<p>Such a nice and non-mysterious equivalence that many students are left unaware of! Visualizing them side by side including data labels, we see this rank-transformation in action:</p>
<div>
<pre><code># Spearman intercept
intercept_spearman = coefficients(lm(rank(X2) ~ rank(X1), D_correlation))[1]

# Spearman plot
P_spearman = ggplot(D_correlation, aes(x=rank(X1), y=rank(X2))) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, lwd=2, aes(color='beta_1')) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=label_rank), nudge_y=1, size=3, color='dark gray') + 
  geom_segment(x=-100, xend=100, 
               y=intercept_spearman, yend=intercept_spearman, 
               lwd=2, aes(color='beta_0')) + 
  scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=c("blue", "red"), labels=c(bquote(beta[0]*" (intercept)"), bquote(beta[1]*" (slope)")))

<h3> Theory: rank-transformation</h3>
<p><code>rank</code> simply takes a list of numbers and “replace” them with the integers of their rank (1st smallest, 2nd smallest, 3rd smallest, etc.). So the result of the rank-transformation <code>rank(c(3.6, 3.4, -5.0, 8.2))</code> is <code>3, 2, 1, 4</code>. See that in the figure above?</p>
<p>A <em>signed</em> rank is the same, just where we rank according to absolute size first and then add in the sign second. So the signed rank here would be <code>2, 1, -3, 4</code>. Or in code:</p>
<pre><code>signed_rank = function(x) sign(x) * rank(abs(x))</code></pre>
<p>I hope I don’t offend anyone when I say that ranks are easy; yet it’s all you need to do to convert most parametric tests into their “non-parametric” counterparts! One interesting implication is that <em>many “non-parametric tests” are about as parametric as their parametric counterparts with means, standard deviations, homogeneity of variance, etc. - just on rank-transformed data</em>. That’s why I put “non-parametric” in quotation marks.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-code-pearson-correlation">
<h3> R code: Pearson correlation</h3>
<p>It couldn’t be much simpler to run these models in R. They yield identical <code>p</code> and <code>t</code>, but there’s a catch: <code>lm</code> gives you the <em>slope</em> and even though that is usually much more interpretable and informative than the <em>correlation coefficient</em> <em>r</em>, you may still want <em>r</em>. Luckily, the slope becomes <code>r</code> if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have identical standard deviations. For now, we will use <code>scale(x)</code> to make <span>\(SD(x) = 1.0\)</span> and <span>\(SD(y) = 1.0\)</span>:</p>
<pre><code>a = cor.test(y, x, method = "pearson") # Built-in
b = lm(y ~ 1 + x) # Equivalent linear model: y = Beta0*1 + Beta1*x
c = lm(scale(y) ~ 1 + scale(x))  # On scaled vars to recover r</code></pre><p>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out.

<p>It's been more than three years since I've been hooked into Crystal Lang. For
those who don't know, Crystal promises to be able to write high-level code,
borrowing syntax from Ruby while adding strongly-typed yet inferred parameters
and avoiding the null exception problem. It also provides a complete and powerful <em>stdlib</em> and uses concepts from new generation languages like Go Lang. </p>
<p>Oh, and a powerful on-compile time macro system making runtime reflection obsolete! </p>
<p>Did it fulfill its promises? Yes. At some costs.</p>
<p>I started developing in Crystal Lang out of curiosity and pleasure, as I thought
this is a fun language to work with. 
Then I challenged myself to see what I was able to write, and it ended up with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear</a></em>, an ORM I've built from scratch.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started working on a booking platform. Getting free hands on the technical side, I decided to design the backend in Crystal. </p>
<p>Nine months later and an app finished, I can give some insight about using Crystal in a professional environment; the <strong>good</strong>, the <strong>bad</strong>, and the <strong>ugly</strong>, and how to develop an app in a language that is still considered confidential and in a pre-release state.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>Crystal kept its promise in being a very expressive language. It allowed me to
write clean high-level business code, allowing to lower the gap between clients
requirement and code syntax. Big <em>oui</em> here!</p>
<pre><code>
post <span>"/contact_us"</span> <span>do</span> <span>|env|</span>
  form = ContactUsForm.from_json(env.request.body.not_nil!)
  Mail.deliver ContactUsEmail.new(form.email, form.title, form.message)
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The customer had some very complex rules when bookings were moved or canceled,
and I was aware that two teams of developers had given up on this project prior
to my work. </p>
<p>I decided to go for a Controller - Business Logic - Model 3-tier on
the backend and keep the View and Presentation on the frontend (using Typescript
and MithrilJS). </p>
<p>Because Crystal is strongly typed, the work to be done on spec
and coverage of the code is strongly reduced, in comparison to a Ruby or Python
code. </p>
<p>80% of the bugs occurring in those script languages have their root cause
laying in lose parameter type or nullable type. Both cases are covered at
compile time in Crystal. Basically, I wrote only 120 test cases on this
application, covering the different business cases of the user. In Ruby, for an
application of this scale, I would be around 250 to 400 tests.</p>
<p>At release, the application faced very few bugs. 
Some edges case we forgot with the client were failing. But so far, the compiler did an excellent job in preventing most of the bugs. </p>
<p>Because the language is compiled, it is wonderful to use within a Kubernetes cluster: The app starts in less than 200ms, allowing horizontal scaling, health-check and automatic restart of the app much more convenient than a big Rails application. </p>
<p>Memory usage is relatively low, peeking to ~250Mb and I never experienced any memory leak whatsoever. </p>
<p>And it runs fast. Really fast. For those who used to work with Rails, Django, or Laravel,
we are comparing snails with a cheetah there. </p>
<p>Actually, it runs so fast that I decided to do some complex data aggregation and transformation directly in Crystal instead of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>The major challenge I faced in keeping a good pace and being productive was the
compilation time. It takes around 20 seconds to compile/run spec on my i7 8750H.
We are talking of an app with ~9000 LOC, few shards (library), for a grand total
of probably less than 100k LOC. This compilation time is mostly due to the very
dynamic nature of Crystal lang, the work needed to be done at
compile-time  (<em> macro and type inference being the culprits </em>) , and the lack of
incremental compilation at the time of writing this article. 20 seconds seems
not much, but during a whole working day, it builds-up leading to a
non-negligible loss of productivity. For the defense of the language, the
problem is also at the developer level: it is just enough to lose focus, browse
few tabs on Reddit, check a video on Youtube, and can - too often! -  snowball
to minutes or more. Guilty I am!</p>
<p>Another challenge was the usage of the young library ecosystem. The language is
still confidential and some shards  (the name which is given to libraries in the Crystal
world) are not working with the latest version of Crystal, or lack of support,
as some authors just gave up on the language or have little to no time to
maintain them. 
I can't complain, as I am too responsible for this, as I gave little maintenance the last months over <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anykeyh/clear">Clear ORM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly?</h2>
<p>During development, I faced a few but worrying bugs, where the compiler was
literally crashing without any idea of where the problem came from. It also
happens that using some complex features of the language, like inheriting from
generic classes could lead to segfault during execution after a while. Issues
were raised and the Crystal Lang team fixed everything on short notice.</p>
<p>Since now, I'm not able to build the backend using <code>--release</code> flag due to
segfault at compile time. 
This is not a problem <em>per se</em>, as even without the optimization, the backend spends like 90% of its time waiting for PostgreSQL. </p>
<p>I still get a random crash of the application I gave up fixing for now.
Basically, the app can't access anymore to the PostgreSQL database after a
while.
This occurs on average between 3 to 30 days of running; I defined an
<code>/healthcheck</code> endpoint throwing a simple <code>SELECT 1</code>; to check the connection, called each second by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>With multiple pods redundancy, and thanks to low
memory foot-print and quick start-up time, pods defaulted got evicted and
recreated in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>If I did this app using Rails, would have I been more productive?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as I spent quite a lot of time debugging, improving, and
maintaining Clear ORM within the scope of this project. I think the
productivity difference would have been negligible.</p>
<p>What you would win by having a strict compiler avoiding your hours of debugging 
and specs definition, you lose by the compile-time, the need to rewrite some 
basic functionality you could get via gems. </p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend people using Crystal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are aware that something might break, as the ecosystem is still young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoiding monolithic application patterns will certainly reduce the compile-time
problems. Having micro-service architecture is a must-have if you want to
develop with Crystal, as each service will take much less time to compile, test
and deploy. </p>
<p>The low memory footprint and fast execution time fit perfectly with
this architecture. If you come from the Ruby world, you will feel at ease with
the syntax but will have to learn new design patterns of face issues with
compile-time or overly complex macro/code.
A common mistake is to try to use open hash, JSON, or collection to realize too late that strongly typed language doesn't like open structures</p>
<p><strong>Compared to Go Lang or Rust, how do Crystal fits?</strong> </p>
<p>Go Lang is very dull and <em>feels</em> austere in my opinion. It's not a bad
technology, but it feels not enough magical for my personal taste.
Rust is great but it remains less elegant to write business code with it. 
The magic Rust does with the memory still adds a burden in terms of readability,
with reference, lifecycle, and other symbols polluting the essence of the code
in my opinion. </p>
<p>Knowing that the Crystal Lang team is aware of most of the
problems above and working hard to release the v1.0 of the language, I'm
confident the language will know a bright future and all the traction it merits.</p>

			<p>Note: <em>I wrote a quite complete article on the Zen but for some reason it went down in seo history. I am tired seeing people write ‘in-depth’ article with commentaries from the top of their head and materials they pulled out of their pockets. I’m publishing the article in here.  The commentary part is built from the sayings of Brett Cannon, Guido, Chris Angelico, Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger &amp; co. Warning: read only if you are a fan of Python. Last notes: I do hope learners will get a great glimpse of how the Zen can help them structure their code and give them better insight and foresight. It’s a documentation  of how practically the Zen is applied in Python decisions.</em></p>

<li>Birth of the Path</li>
<li>Zen, Strunk and White</li>
<li>Master Tim Showers his Blessings</li>
<li>Authentic Commentary</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zen of Python saw light for the first time in 1999. It’s one of the many aspects that adds to the awesomeness of Python. It’s a set of expressions which corners the spirit of the language. It was enounced by Tim Peters, a reputable software engineer, master Pythonista and Python’s ‘most prolific and tenacious core developer’ in the words of none other than Guido [18]. This article bases itself mostly on the saying of core devs and highly reputable members. It makes a great gift to all those interested in the history of the sysadmin script which took the world by (pleasent) surprise.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598545343242-89b4c263a343?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The way the Zen came about was unique. It was a reflection from the unknown Patrick Phalen about the Python feel [1]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  … the more I use<br>
  and learn about the language, the more I find myself appreciating the<br>
  nice balance and heft Guido gave to it. Yet there doesn’t seem to be a<br>
  single document that sums up that “aesthetic,” but rather it<br>
  tends to appear piecemeal, over time, mostly in the Wisdom of Chairman Tim.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a call to infuse the Python spirit into aliens from Perl Land and beyond. It requested some 10 to 20 lines which sums up the Python view</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Would both Guido and TIm Peters be willing to collaborate on a short<br>
  paper — call it “The Python Way” for lack of a better title — which<br>
  sets out the 10-20 prescriptives they might offer to those who come to<br>
  Python from other languages and immediately want to find a way to bend<br>
  it into uncomfortable positions — (implement closures, etc.).
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a request to prevent Pythonistas from falling into the error of campaigning for changing the language. It advocated for imbuing yourself with the language’s flow and change your ways and views instead of the other way round. In the original mail, it quoted Fredrik Lundh as saying “sure looks like the ‘community’ thinks that changing the<br>
language is more important that using it…” [5]. Patrick clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What I have in mind is sort of a very brief Strunk-&amp;-White-like<br>
  “Elements of Style” for Python, which suggests fundamental idiomatic<br>
  recommendations for operating within the spirit of the language. A<br>
  distillation of Python Zen is what I’m talking about — something to go<br>
  off and contemplate when the “fix Python now” decibels become a bit<br>
  much.
</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555573989-14a9017746c3?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=749&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen school lays out hints and guidelines. You understand by your own exercise and by the company of someone seasoned in the craft</p>
<blockquote><p>
  it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master.[2]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen was a request to help Python people achieve the Python state of mind so that your code resonates well with the structure behind, conveying in the process the associated beauty, elegance and finesse. Those guidelines if well impregnated would make your code revered whithin the circle of true monks.</p>
<p>But, curiously enough, Tim tells [19]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I were to change anything, I’d drop the reference to “Zen”.  That wasn’t<br>
  part of the original, and was added by someone else.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the title is not from the author [23]</p>
<p>Strunk &amp; White is the name of two people, viz William Strunk and Elwyn Brooks White. Strunk wrote <em>The Elements of Style</em>, acclaimed by the Times as one of the most influencial books since 1923 [3]. White who was Strunk’s student and reviser after the professor’s death describes the book as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  a forty-three page summation of the case<br>
  for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English [4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>The effect of the book is described below, he being Strunk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  he omitted so<br>
  many needless words, and omitted them so forcibly and with such eagerness and obvious<br>
  relish, that he often seemed in the position of having shortchanged himself — a man left<br>
  with nothing more to say yet with time to fill, a radio prophet who had out-distanced the<br>
  clock. Will Strunk got out of this predicament by a simple trick: he uttered every sentence<br>
  three times
</p></blockquote>
<p>One effect of applying the Zen would then also be lighter code files.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484108678824-e6543e2e4230?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=752&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>Master Tim heard the plea, approved the demand and responded accordingly [6]</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Clearly a job for Guido alone — although I doubt it’s one he’ll take on<br>
  (fwiw, I wish he would too!).  Here’s the outline he would start from,<br>
  though <wink>:
</wink></p></blockquote>
<pre><code>Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
</code></pre>
<p>The 20th was left for Guido to fill in:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There you go:  20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I’m<br>
  leaving for Guido to fill in.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Venerable Tim shares exactly how the lines came about [15]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It was a throwaway python-list post. But like all great triumphs of literature, it was written during commercials breaks while watching professional wrestling on TV, and munching on a ham sandwich. All true!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, the author is emphatical: It’s complete and more than meets the demand [6]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If the answer to <em>any</em> Python design issue<br>
  isn’t obvious after reading those — well, I just give up <wink>.
</wink></p></blockquote>
<p>The above also reveals the purpose of the Zen: To address design issues. And it’s not a simple matter. Guido says [18]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the design philosophy I used when creating Python is probably one of the main reasons for its ultimate success.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Zen only gives the outlines, in contrast to Strunk and White which gives explanations and examples in addition. Thus the need for commentaries. These help the non-initiated without being a replacement for the company of the bright minds.</p>
<p>In a time of fluctuating and steered standards, the reference in the actual PEP8 document to Strunk and White in the usage of the English language caused a bitter, ugly and messy thread [7]. It caused some of the best people of the community to forego following  python-list [8], a casual reminder that being too open without limit hurts.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593297372323-2ba78409d0b1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>The Zen has become an important piece of the Python programming language. If you don’t know the Zen, you won’t strike the right chord to communicate with the community. Raymond Hettinger advises:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Before creating more tracker items, please take time to learn about how Python’s history, how it is used, and its cultural norms.  In particular, read the Zen of Python, consider what is meant by duck-typing, what is meant by “a consenting adults language”, what is meant by over-specification, etc.  Python is quite different from Java in this regard. [13]
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a practical aspect to it. It’s popular because it works [14]. It’s the golden guiding principle in pretty much everything Python.</p>
<p>Finally are the Zen points rules? What are they really. Many people take the Zen for rules. The ‘most opinionated linter ever’ at one time actually included the Zen to back their views [9]. It was situations like these which prompted me to write: The Zen Of Python Is A Joke And Here Is Why [10]. It was nice enough for Michael Kennedy and Brian Okken to call it a ‘must read’ on PythonBytes [11].</p>
<p>According to Nick Coghlan, the Zen gives you the idea, not everything [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This<br>
  challenge is reflected in the fact that the Zen of Python is<br>
  deliberately self-contradictory, as it articulates competing design<br>
  principles to take into consideration, rather than being able to<br>
  provide ironclad rules that avoid the need for human judgement in<br>
  determining which of those design guidelines are most salient in any<br>
  given situation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Self contradiction is also coincidentally, one of the criticised aspect of Strunk and White [17].<br>
The Zen also goes beyond coding, such as shaping the thought pattern of features [12]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The thing we work toward as core developers, and aspiring core<br>
  developers, is good design intuition that aligns with the Zen of<br>
  Python. That doesn’t mean we’re all going to be able to perfectly<br>
  articulate that intuition in every case, and even when we can, those<br>
  explanations are themselves generally going to be backed by intuition<br>
  rather than rigorous scientific research.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If ever i myself would have added a 20th one it would have been: “Use your judgement.”. But Nick illustrated it better.</p>
<p>As for the famous <code>import this</code> command, it was Barry Warsaw’s pick. He sneaked it in a this.py in 2001 along with the ROT13 obfuscation [16]. He also mentionned that it was a time ‘when the Python community had a sense of humor’.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561739091-9d698cb277ec?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=750&amp;q=80" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></p>

<p>Now the time is ripe to see what the Zen actually means. But before we should know that whatever the words<br>
and concepts mean in the Zen is not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><h2>Intro</h2><p>People use computer simulations to both understand the world and design for it. Those who need to know where a satellite will be at some future time build simulations of the forces acting on the satellite and propagate its motion from some known location and velocity. Those who design robots create simulations of the environments their robots will experience in order to test how the robots make decisions and move. And those designing power plants simulate weather, energy demand, and system failures to determine the best design for a range of conditions and uncertainty.</p><p>However, despite the importance and widespread applicability, few receive education on the subject. The best information is scattered in places one might not know to look, and even most simulation textbooks are narrowly targeted to specific applications or tools. The inevitable result is that many simulations suffer from basic problems that have easy solutions.</p><p>This article will set out the critical aspects of building good simulations — that is, simulations that are accurate, easy to develop and analyze, and fast. The first sections deal with how a simulation evolves over time, as this is the core of any simulation. Further sections deal with details that make simulations easier to develop, faster, and applicable to a large number of variations. The target audience is engineers, scientists, and programmers, whether new to creating simulations or experienced. A tiny amount of vector math and calculus is assumed, making this text accessible to first- and second-year undergraduates. By the end, the reader should be able to begin building quality simulations, avoid common pitfalls, communicate the reasons for their decisions to peers, and know where to look for additional resources on specific topics and for the mathematical rigor behind it all.</p><p>We'll start with the motivation for understanding the core of how systems evolve over time.</p><h2 id="TToDt">From \(t\) to \(t+\Delta t\)</h2><p>Let’s get started with a really basic example.

At some time, we know its position and velocity, and from this we want to simulate the future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon_illustration.png"><figcaption>Planet and moon</figcaption></figure><p>We know the planet pulls on the moon with gravity, so the moon’s acceleration at any point in time is:</p><p>$$\vec{a}(t) = -\frac{GM}{r(t)^2} \hat{\vec{r}}(t)$$</p><p>Here, \(\vec{a}(t)\) is the acceleration vector, \(\vec{r}(t)\) is the position of the moon with respect to the center of mass of the planet, \(\hat{\vec{r}}\) denotes a unit vector in the direction of \(\vec{r}\), \(r\) denotes the magnitude of \(\vec{r}\), and \(GM\) is the gravitational constant of the planet (remember high school?). Let’s ignore all other forces that might act on the moon for now, since this is overwhelmingly the biggest. How do we turn this into a simulator? It might seem obvious: if we know \(\vec{r}(t)\) and \(\vec{v}(t)\) for some \(t\), then at some time later, \(t + \Delta t\), if \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{a}\) are nearly constant across this \(\Delta t\), we would have:</p><p>$$\vec{v}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{v}(t) + \vec{a}(t) \Delta t$$
$$\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) \approx \vec{r}(t) + \vec{v}(t) \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}(t) \Delta t^2$$</p><p>Perhaps by taking a series of small \(\Delta t\) and updating the position and velocity along the way, we'll generate the future trajectory. That certainly seems easy enough, so let's try it out. We'll pick a moon in a circular orbit about the planet. It has a period, \(T\), of 30 time units (we can call them days, but it doesn't really matter) and is located at 1 distance unit from the planet. Since it's a circular orbit, the velocity has magnitude of \(2 \pi / T\) and is perpendicular to the vector from the planet to the moon. Finally, \(GM = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2\). We'll take a series of time steps, each \(\Delta t\) in length. Let's use \(\Delta t\) = 1 time unit, so there should be 30 time steps in the orbit, bringing the moon exactly back to where it started. Here are the results using the “multiply by \(\Delta t\)” method above, plotted on top of the actual future trajectory.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon2.png"><figcaption>Initial simulation</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a very good circle. What went wrong?</p><p>Let's zoom in on the very first time step. Note that as the moon moves, the acceleration should change to always point towards the planet, but since we've assumed the acceleration is constant across \(\Delta t\), the acceleration in this step is always to the left in this figure. This doesn't affect the position all that much, but look at the velocity compared to the true velocity (since this system has a closed form solution, we can compare to an exact value for truth). The stepped velocity wasn't “pulled back” towards the planet enough (since it always pulled left). The result is that the moon is now going a little too fast and to the outside of the true trajectory. This image is not to scale so that we might better see the small difference in the two velocities at the upper left.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon1.png"><figcaption>First time step</figcaption></figure><p>As this continues, the velocity will always have a systematic error, leaning to the outside with every step. The error builds up rapidly, and so our simulated trajectory is not useful. Of course, we used a really big time step. Only 30 time steps for the whole trajectory? That seems ambitious. Let's cut the time step down by a factor of 2. And then by another factor of 2. And then again, again, again, and again.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon3.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps</figcaption></figure><p>With our smallest time step above we're now taking 1920 time steps, and still the error is huge (given that these are planets).</p><p>Now let's fix it. Note that the stepped trajectory is always to the outside, no matter how small the time step. What if we used some method of stepping that wouldn't have this outward tendency? Something that would take a step, see that the new acceleration is significantly different from the acceleration of the previous step, and figure out what the acceleration was across the time step? Fortunately, some great mathematicians have figured out excellent, all-purpose ways to do this. For example, applying one of the most common and all-purpose methods (it's not tailored to orbits in any way), we can achieve less error than our most precise time step above with only 11 steps. Yes, 11. These are plotted as dots on top of the true trajectory below. Let's find out how.</p><figure><img src="http://www.anuncommonlab.com/articles/how-simulations-work/img/moon4.png"><figcaption>Multiple time steps with a much better solution</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ODEs">Ordinary Differential Equations</h2><p>First, we need to establish what types of things we're going to propagate. When we have systems with some <dfn>state</dfn> (like position and velocity) at some time and we calculate the derivatives of that state (velocity and acceleration for the example) at that time, we call this an <dfn>ordinary differential equation</dfn> (ODE) (and when we're dealing with motion, we call this the <dfn>equation of motion</dfn>). We usually stick all of the parts of the state together into a column matrix and call it the <dfn>state vector</dfn>.</p><p>$$ x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{r}(t) \\ \vec{v}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we have this for the time derivative:</p><p>$$ \frac{d x(t)}{dt} \equiv \dot{x}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v}(t) \\ \vec{a}(t) \end{bmatrix}$$</p><p>Then we describe the ODE something like this:</p><p>$$ \dot{x}(t) = f(t, x(t))$$
which just states that the derivatives depend on time and the current state and nothing else. It's also common to drop the explicit dependence on time, because it's generally understood. For our example, we have:
$$ \dot{x} = f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{v} \\ -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}} \end{bmatrix} $$</p><p>When we're keeping track of position by simulating its acceleration, it's a <dfn>second-order system</dfn>, because acceleration is the second-derivative of position. However, in terms of the state vector, \(x\), it's a <dfn>first-order system</dfn> (we calculate \(\dot{x}\) and not \(\ddot{x}\)). This can cause confusion, so we should just remember that the system is ultimately second-order, and we're just conveniently packaging up everything into \(x\) so as to use first-order techniques on \(x\).</p><p>In general, \(f(x)\) is our model of something, which might be nonlinear and even stochastic. The only assumption we make about the whole system is that it's differentiable (smooth-ish). It probably doesn't have a closed-form solution or we'd use the closed-form solution instead of simulating (our circular orbit of course has a closed-form solution, but that's just so that we can compare our simulation to something exact).</p><p>We'll talk about other types of systems (things that aren't ODEs) later. For now, this gives us plenty of great material since a plethora of physical systems are described as ODEs that boil down to \(\dot{x} = f(x)\), such as equations of motion, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, population growth, etc. Having a generic framework to describe these systems therefore lets us describe the solvers in a generic way, making them applicable to a great number of different problems.</p><h2 id="FixedStep">Fixed-Step Solvers</h2><p>In the orbit example, we held the acceleration constant across the time step, and this ultimately created a systemic bias to one side. Of course, we could easily have seen that the acceleration wasn't constant across the time step. For instance, we could have propagated by one time step, re-calculated the acceleration, and used this updated value to determine how the acceleration had changed across the time step, allowing us to revise the step. Drawing from this motivation, an excellent solution was created by Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta a long while back. They proposed taking a series of small steps forward, using the derivatives along the way to determine the effective derivatives across the entire time step in such a way that the errors could be made very, very small.</p><h3>Runge-Kutta Fourth Order Method</h3><p>The most common Runge-Kutta method is known as “the” fourth order method, and we'll call it RK4. It involves calculating the derivatives four times like so:</p><ol><li>First, calculate the derivative at \(t\), 
$$ k_1 = f(t, x(t)) $$</li><li>Form an intermediate update of the state, 
$$ x(t + \frac{1}{2} …</li></ol></div></div>

<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxG</span><span>-</span><span>minG</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minG</span><span>))</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxB</span><span>-</span><span>minB</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minB</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Wikipedia</a> offers an answer. Unfortunately there’s no citation,
but I’ve confirmed independently that it works. Here it is with some of my own math added as well.</p>

it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>Here it is where the palette is red, green, black, and yellow.</p>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t really emulate any of the yellow in the first example, while Floyd-Steinberg can. Once yellow is added
to the palette it looks pretty good though.</p>

            <p data-wow-delay="3.05s">Based on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Japanese from 2011, these 777 kanji characters are the most frequent kanji in the Japanese language today.  By learning these kanji first, and in this order, one is maximizing their learning efficacy and will immediately see these kanji in native Japanese media, as they occur the most often across all domains (literature, poetry, science, politics, technology, television, novels, and more).</p>
