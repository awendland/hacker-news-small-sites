<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="7c080239" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>The light path node in Blender has always been mysterious to me. While I have found it useful, many times I have not fully understood what it does or how it does it. To finally demystify it, I studied it a bit to learn how it works.</p><p>Hopefully, this article can help you learn what I learned about the light path node quicker.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the light path node in Blender? As we render, rays are cast into our 3D scene from the camera. As these rays bounce around in our scene, they get tagged as different types of&nbsp;rays. The light path node allow us to access this data and manipulate our material based on these ray types.</strong></p><p>I have limited this article to only discuss the different ray types and corresponding outputs on the light path node. This is the seven first inputs in the node.</p><h2>What is the light path node?</h2><p>The light path node is a node that we can use when creating materials for Cycles or Eevee in Blender. It is more feature rich when used in Cycles, but some outputs from this node is also usable in Eevee.</p><p>We will explain the node from a Cycles perspective since it is easier to understand the underlying concepts that we need to know about using the light path node effectively.</p><p>The light path node can seem mysterious at first. But what it enables us to do is to break the physics of how materials behave based on how we see the material.</p><p>That is mysterious&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>For example, we can say that when a material is viewed through a mirror, it will look different from when we view it directly.</p><p>We can also use the node for performance optimizations or to change the color of shadows and improve our glass materials by combining glass with transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>To understand how it works, we have to understand something about render engines. Therefore, we will start with a somewhat simplified explanation of a render engine itself, and we will use Cycles as the example.</p><h2>How does a ray tracer work?</h2><p>Cycles is a ray-traced engine. This means that to figure out what color each pixel should have in the final image we shoot rays from the position of each pixel into our 3D scene and let them bounce around and gather data about geometry, materials and lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>We shoot many rays for each pixel since they often bounce in random directions, and we need a large enough sample count to approximate the color each pixel should have.</p><p>As a ray bounce around in the scene, it will hit different things. We call each hit a bounce. On each bounce, a few things are tested.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those things that are tested is what we hit. Geometry? A light? Maybe the background.</p><p>In most cases we will probably hit geometry. If we hit geometry, the material for that surface will be analyzed. Depending on the components of that material, the ray will behave in different ways.</p><p>If it is mainly a diffuse material, it may bounce in a random direction. But there may be some glossy component making a certain number of the rays shot bounce in a more predictable outgoing angle.</p><p>As a ray bounce around, the ray itself also carries some information. The information we care about is what kind of ray it is. But also the ray travel distance or how many bounces it made so far.</p><p>Depending on where the ray is coming from it has one or more tags attached to it telling us what kind of ray it is. A ray can be one, or multiple types of rays at the same time.</p><p>We know that we send many rays for each pixel that bounce around in our scene. What this means is that we send light rays from the position of the camera rather than the lamp. This is a key element to understand.</p><p>As we continue to explore ray types and what we can do with them, we will also explore how we gather information with a ray and what information comes from where. In short, we gather information for each bounce.&nbsp;</p><p>But only rays that are shot from a certain pixels’ perspective can contribute to that pixels color. That is another key piece of information.</p><p>If a ray hits geometry, the material is analyzed, and the ray behaves according to the material node tree.</p><p>Rays get tagged differently depending on the last surface they hit.</p><p>We will now explore each ray type in more detail in the order they are listed on the light path node.</p><h3>Camera ray</h3><p>When we shoot a ray from the camera, we consider it a camera ray. That means that all rays start out as camera rays.</p><p>We can also say that a ray is tagged as a camera ray when we can see something directly.</p><p>When the ray hit something, producing the first bounce, it drops the camera tag and picks up a new tag depending on what it hits.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at an example:</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1158" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDExNTgiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExNTgiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMDhfMTdfa0dQSGcucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTE1OCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Here, the camera sees the blue object directly. The rays coming from the camera uses the lower socket of the mix shader since “is camera ray” is true, translating to the value 1.&nbsp;</p><p>When we analyze the floor though, we can see that the bounce light from the cube is green. Something to be aware of here, is that the pixels on the floor don’t get a green tint because a camera ray first hit the cube and then carries information with it to the floor.</p><p>Instead, it is the rays we cast directly onto the floor that then bounce to the cube that gives the green tint. As the rays come from the camera and bounce on the floor, they drop the camera ray and become diffuse rays since the floor is a white diffuse material.</p><p>As some rays then hit the cube, the material is analyzed and since the incoming ray is not a camera ray the “is camera ray” is false and the green diffuse shader gets returned instead of the blue one.</p><p>A key takeaway here is that a ray does not hit and take material information with it to its next destination. Instead, it bounces and sends information back to previous points it hit.</p><p>If the rays was cast from the light, the flow of information would be reversed from the rays perspective, and we would bring information to the next bounce until we reached the camera and could display the correct color for the given&nbsp;pixel.</p><p>This can be a bit confusing since we often talk about the bounce light as coming from the light hitting the cube and bouncing off the floor and into the camera, like it does in the real world. But in cycles, it is the opposite. We bounce on the floor, land on the cube, and send information back to the spot on the floor to get the correct color for the pixel showing this area.</p><p>Make sure you understand why the indirect light on this cube is green and in what direction the rays are traveling before you continue reading. It can get very tricky to understand other ray types if we are not clear about this.</p><p>We are just about to enter the next piece of complexity, the shadow ray. You see, each bounce splits the ray into an additional ray called a shadow ray.</p><h3>Shadow ray</h3><p>When a ray bounces, a shadow ray is split off from the original ray. The shadow ray is a simpler ray that always bounce toward a random light source instead of taking the material into account.</p><p>If the ray can hit the light directly, we know that the spot we bounce from is directly lit by this light source. However, if we can’t connect directly to the light, we are in shadow from this light.&nbsp;</p><p>With enough shadow rays and the information about each light, we can learn how much light hit each spot in our scene.</p><p>So how can we use a shadow ray and what can we do with it in our material? Well, we can color our shadows.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1066" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEwNjYiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNjYiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMzJfMjRfNGRDNGEucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTA2NiIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>To change the color of a shadow using the shadow rays, we use the transparent BSDF shader to tint or completely change the color of a shadow.</p><p>We can also use a texture with our transparent shader.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1109" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDExMDkiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExMDkiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDJfMjlfMTlfMzNfNTZfY2ZsRGkucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTEwOSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>So how does this work? We can say that the light path node changes how an object look to its surrounding.</p><p>In our camera ray example, the cube looks blue to the camera ray. But to the floor, the cube looks green.</p><p>For our shadow ray the cube looks transparent and therefore contributes to the color of the shadow. If we set the transparent BSDF to white, the cube will be fully transparent to the shadow ray and therefore won’t cast a shadow.</p><p>You can also try to use a glass shader to see how the shadow change if the cube is viewed as glass by the shadow.</p><p>Let’s now continue to the diffuse and glossy ray even if we kind of covered diffuse already.</p><h3>Diffuse and glossy ray</h3><p>So, we just expanded our view on rays by saying that an object with a light path node in its material can look different to it’s surrounding based on the incoming ray. This means that a diffuse material may view this object in one way while viewed directly by the camera it may look very different.</p><p>Same for the shadows rays even if we need to introduce some kind of transparency to see a real effect here.</p><p>We earlier also explored the diffuse ray, and it is pretty&nbsp;easy to understand as long as we know the direction of the ray and how information travels back from one bounce to another.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1315" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEzMTUiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMTUiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDNfMDJfMTJfMzRfNDRfVXFMeVYucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwMjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTMxNSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The materials we have here are sharp and glossy. Meaning roughness set to 0 on the left side, a rough glass surface on the right side and a glass material in the middle.</p><p>It may come as no surprise that both glossy surfaces become green. But what about the glass shader? The glass shader actually&nbsp;contains a glossy component. Remember how we said that light rays may carry more than one “ray type”. The glass shader is such an example. It carries both a “glossy ray” tag and a “transmission ray” tag.</p><p>We covered the diffuse ray as we looked at the camera ray. But we never tested the diffuse ray output from the light path node. Therefore, I just changed from the glossy ray in the example above to the diffuse ray to show you what it looks like.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="1315" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDEzMTUiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMTUiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZhcnRpc3RpY3JlbmRlci5jb20lMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwMyUyRjIwMjBfMDNfMDJfMTJfMzRfNDRfVXFMeVYtMS5wbmciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTAyNCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMzE1IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>You can see that the only place we have diffuse rays is when a ray bounce on the floor up on the cube, sampling data and use that information to determine the indirect color of the floor.</p><h3>Singular reflection and transmission rays</h3><p>The ray types we have left to learn about are singular reflection and transmission.</p><p>Before we continue here, keep in mind that these ray types are only available in Cycles and not in Eevee.</p><p>We will start with the singular ray.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bb49bdb516c4ad0f99fa5fc3909b4f5caf8d5253/1dd14/images/uploads/ad-test-results-2.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

In so many ways, a remarkable piece of engineering.  Efficient, comfortable, and not so bad in the cargo territory.  In it’s plugin form, it can run 20-25 miles on pure EV power, and after that, it still chugs along at 40mpg.  For people wanting to dip their toes into the electric vehicle world, it’s not a bad place to start, assuming you’re okay with the styling.</p><p>With all that, what the HELL went wrong when they ‘designed’ the dashboard and the information systems?  </p><p>I’m rarely speechless when it comes to engineering projects, particularly ones backed by such a well respected and successful company as Toyota.  But jumpin jehosephat.  Who the heck designed the dashboard?  It’s… it’s… nnnnng…. well… let me show you.</p></div>



<h2>The Dashboard – An Introduction</h2>



<p><br>First, lets take a look at the interior.  This is the 2019 Prius Prime dashboard, directly from Toyota’s brochure…</p>



<figure><a href="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg 1024w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-300x161.jpg 300w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-768x411.jpg 768w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1536x823.jpg 1536w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-2048x1097.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Now before I go straight to the jugular, lets note a few positive aspects here.</p>



<ul><li>A large, centrally located touchscreen.  I like that.  It’s easy to reach, everyone in the car can see it, it’s bright and visible. </li><li>The steering wheel has easy to reach controls, right under the thumbs.  Nice.</li><li>The upper display (directly in front of the window) has 3 smaller screens that can show a variety of information panels.  The most obvious one is a speedometer, but the other options are battery usage, mileage, map directions, etc.  As compared to the Tesla, which puts everything on one display in the middle of the car, these secondary displays that ALWAYS display certain information is a nice touch.</li></ul>



<h2>Well, that’s nice, but what’s your beef?</h2>



<p>Sounds all peachy so far, right?  I mean, it looks all shiny and clean, so what’s wrong?</p>



<p>Turns out, plenty.</p>



<p>Lets start at the meta level.  That big central display?  It only controls a small subset of the car systems.  It’s a bad design to have to go hunting for an external button or switch or toggle or display to get a basic function that the display should have on it.</p>



<p>Another problem with the central display are the buttons on the glass on either side.  Those are flush contacts.  You have to look at them to determine if you’re pushing them, and there’s no feedback when you do.  Talk about distracted driver problems.  No feedback contact buttons should be used VERY CAREFULLY in motor vehicles.  Why some of these buttons are glass and others in the car are standard switches, I have no idea.</p>



<h2>Okay, but lets hear the real fails.</h2>



<p>Okay, you asked for it, lets start running down some absolutely batshit decisions made on this car.</p>



<ol><li>Lets start simple.  Seat heaters.  Everyone loves ’em, right?  Took us literally googling and watching youtube videos to figure out how to turn them on.  The controls for the seat heaters are tucked under the dash, on either side of the central console.  Once I scrunched down in the seat, bent my head to one side, I was able to see them.  My wife, who is a foot and a half shorter than I am, never saw them either.  Who thought this was the appropriate placement for these switches?</li><li>Remember those little screens under the front windshield?  Nice, aren’t they?  Well, they are configurable.  You can change what each one shows.  At some point, my wife brought up “Hey, that middle display used to show how much battery time I had left, now it doesn’t.  How do you change that?” – I, a systems engineer, could absolutely not figure out how to change those displays.  The answer?  Tap the right arrow on the steering wheel right control pad.  No other feedback that this is how to do this – no menus, no prompts, no information – I had to google this one too.  There’s nothing on that nice big central display that lets you configure these smaller displays.  They are completely separate.</li><li>At one point we were driving around at night, and I was wondering why the central screen was so bright.  Most cars switch into ‘night mode’ when it gets dark, but this screen was blazing white.  Going through all the menus, I found a screen setting for ‘DAY MODE’ ON/OFF – what exactly that means is sort of a mystery.  There was no NIGHT MODE ON/OFF.  Just that one toggle.  Turns out, you need to use the OTHER screen control.  The one on the left side of the steering column around knee height.  There’s a dial there that on older cars would set the brightness of the dashboard instruments.  Some bright engineer at Toyota decided that if that little knob was spun to a certain point, the central console would always be in day mode.  the DAY MODE apparently can override this setting?  Who knows – but having to go off-screen to some random control when the option should have been RIGHT THERE on the screen is definitely a fail.</li><li>Backup beeper.  Did you know the Prius has a backup beeper?  Going by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-up_beeper">Wikipedia</a> : <quote>A back-up beeper, also known as back-up alarm or vehicle motion alarm, is a device intended to warn passers-by of a vehicle moving in reverse. They typically produce 1000 Hz pure tone beeps at 97-112 decibels.[1] Matsusaburo Yamaguchi of Yamaguchi Electric Company, Japan, invented the back-up beeper. It was first manufactured as model BA1 in 1963.[2] ISO 6165 describes “audible travel alarms”, and ISO 9533 describes how to measure the performance of the alarms</quote><p>Great idea, right?  Except the Prius backup beeper SOUNDS INSIDE THE CAR.  Not externally.  You can’t hear it outside.  Who exactly is this supposed to be warning?</p></li><li>The mapping software sucks.  I mean, you just can’t get around it.  It’s cumbersome, it’s painful to use, the search functions are absolute shit, and it’s just a nightmare to try and use productively.  Took us another zillion years to figure out how to turn off the turn by turn navigation (you can’t except via a buried setting – makes listening to music really terrifying – why can’t you just say ‘turn off turn by turn for now, I’m listening to something cool, I don’t need the interruptions telling me that I’ll be on this interstate until the heat death of the universe.’</li><li>Most functions are disabled while in motion.  This seems to carry over from day 0 of cars getting anything more complicated than an FM stereo head unit.  Someone somewhere said “We should disable any function that may be a distraction to the driver, with no option to get around it”, and so it was.  But, what if you’re traveling in a modern vehicle that thoughtfully placed the navigation system between the driver and passenger seat, where the passenger has the same access as the driver, wouldn’t it make sense to allow the passe… NOPE!  Locked out!  You can’t modify your route or destination or settings while in motion.  DENIED.</li></ol>



<h2>Denoument</h2>



<p>I’m sure I’ll be adding to this list as more things come up.  What’s bothersome about all this is so much of this can be fixed in software.  But as far as I can tell, Toyota is following the auto manufacturer trend of assuming once a model year of a car is complete, so is the software, and it doesn’t need to change.  They may do minor tweaks and fixes, but they do not actually revise the systems with major improvements (unlike Tesla, who put out <a href="https://www.teslafi.com/firmware.php">major software updates pretty much constantly</a>, frequently adding new features or overhauling others).  </p>



<p>It may sound like I’m bashing Toyota and ignoring flaws in other manufacturers.  That’s not the case at all.  I’ve written in the past about <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2019/09/02/ev-cars/everything-wrong-with-my-tesla-model-3-performance/">my issues with the Tesla Model 3</a>, and while I didn’t have a lot of complaints about my <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/05/09/geekitude/one-week-with-the-chevy-volt/">Chevy Volt</a>, there were some <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/07/30/hacks/ownstar-vulnerability-in-onstar-application-for-gm-vehicles/">frustrations with GM</a>.  (In fact, I had some UX problems with the Volt as well, but the Volt didnt’ have the big touchscreen that SHOULD have made those problems easy to fix.)</p>



<p>Modern car manufacturers absolutely need to get on board, and stop thinking of the dashboard with a touchscreen as just a ‘shiny’ version of the old knobs and dials dashboards.  It’s a fully functioning digital information and control system, and should be treated as such, with regular updates, and some put into UX design.  Tesla is the only company that is doing this right.  What the heck is everyone else thinking?</p>

      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

			<p><i>Happy Holidays. This week we are reprinting our top stories of 2020. This article first appeared online in our “Energy” issue in June, 2020.</i></p><p><span>D</span>ear Bella,</p><p>I’m going to imitate Rudyard Kipling and tell you a just-so story. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the world 100 years ago. He wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i>. And also <i>Just So Stories</i>, which began as bedtime stories he told his daughter Josephine. They were about how animals got their famous features, like the camel’s hump and the leopard’s spots. Kipling was a wonderful writer but he made up his animal stories. My story is based on science, which means many people, through many recent experiments, have concluded things might “just so” be the way of this story.</p><p>It’s also a story about evolution, which is nature’s research and development department. Like Kipling, I’ve given a human voice to certain things: Bacteria form committees and petition the research and development department for answers to their problems, as do plants and dinosaurs. And the R&amp;D department (which is to say, evolution) tries to come up with solutions. I’m going to call evolution “Mr. R&amp;D.” When he finds a problem, Mr. R&amp;D tests things out in different ways to come up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions have unforeseen consequences. So here we go!</p><blockquote><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. But why did dinosaurs have them?</p> </blockquote><p>Once upon a time, on a cold day in January, I was jogging through Regent’s Park in London, stepping carefully through flocks of geese, seagulls, pigeons, and ducks surrounding the boating lake. But, perhaps because of the book I had just been reading (Nick Lane’s <i>Oxygen</i>) my eye picked out a couple of geese that were strangers in this flock: Bar-headed geese, a boy and a girl.<br></p><p>But what were they doing in London in January? During the winter, they usually live in the middle of India, and in the summer they live in Kazakhstan or Mongolia. If you look at a map of the Earth, you can see the barrier between Kazakhstan and India is the Himalayan Mountain Range, the tallest in the world. Every year, millions of bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas and have been doing so for millions of years. They have been seen flying at 28,000 feet. They have flown over Mount Everest! How do they do that?</p><p>The answer seems to be that bar-headed geese, like all birds—hummingbirds, ostriches, pigeons—have super-efficient lungs. It makes our lungs—and the lungs of all mammals—look primitive. I’m sure when birds get together they gossip about how pathetic our lungs are!</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17339_169ea72d893b7bfe6a36b531a78b48af.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BIG AIR:</strong> Dinosaur’s lungs were so efficient that when oxygen levels rose over tens of millions of years, they were able to get very big—bigger than land mammals like elephants have ever gotten, or ever could get.</span><span>VectorPlotnikoff / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>All mammals, including us, breathe in through the same opening that we breathe out. Can you imagine if our digestive system worked the same way? What if the food we put in our mouths, after digestion, came out the same way? It doesn’t bear thinking about! Luckily, for digestion, we have a separate in and out. And that’s what the birds have with their lungs: an in point and an out point. They also have air sacs and hollow spaces in their bones. When they breathe in, half of the good air (with oxygen) goes into these hollow spaces, and the other half goes into their lungs through the rear entrance. When they breathe out, the good air that has been stored in the hollow places now also goes into their lungs through that rear entrance, and the bad air (carbon dioxide and water vapor) is pushed out the front exit. So it doesn’t matter whether birds are breathing in or out: Good air is always going in one direction through their lungs, pushing all the bad air out ahead of it.<br></p><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs! When I was growing up in the 1940s, there was a category in biology called Aves, which meant birds. But scientists have now folded Aves into a category called Dinosauria, and those dinosauria, like pigeons and seagulls and geese, are flying all around us today. If you want to know what a dinosaur probably tasted like, eat some chicken!</p><blockquote><p>Plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this.</p> </blockquote><p>So, dinosaurs had this super-efficient lung system, and they successfully strode the Earth as the dominant species, starting around 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid crashed into Mexico and most of them went extinct. Except for birds. But why did dinosaurs have this super lung system in the first place?<br></p><p>To answer that, we have to go way back, to when plants came out of the ocean onto land, about 450 million years ago. Earlier than that, plant life lived only in the ocean: The surface of the Earth was a desert.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, some pioneer plants got together and said, “Let’s go!” and migrated up onto land. But once the plants got out of the water, they discovered something they never had to deal with in the ocean: gravity. In the ocean, if you’re a plant, you can just float, because the density of a plant is not that different from water. Out of the ocean, the density of a plant is much greater than air, and so gravity can pull it down.</p><p>So for many tens of millions of years, plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this, and decided to form a committee to request an exemption from Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello. What’s your problem?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Our problem is gravity. We never had to deal with it in the ocean, and it’s a problem for us on land.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Why is gravity a problem for you?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: We want to do what we did in the ocean, which is absorb lots of sunlight, and the best way to do that is to have a long stalk, and then to have branches with leaves at the end of the branches and maximize our potential to absorb sunlight.</p> <p><b>MR. R&amp;D</b>: I understand what you want, but it will take me some time. Come back in a million years or so.</p> <p><i>The plants twiddle their thumbs for a million years.</i></p> <p><b>PC</b>: OK, a million years is up! Did you manage to discover something?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Yes, let me see, I think I have it in the drawer. Here it is: lignin.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: What’s lignin?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: It’s a rigid molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. If you absorb it into the cells of your body, it will interact with the molecules of floppy cellulose you already have, and this will create a very firm structure that will allow your cells to become like bricks. You can then stack one cell upon the other, and you can go as high as you want.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: How high?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Over 300 feet.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Wow!</p> <p>So the plants happily swallowed the lignin, and sure enough, it worked exactly as Mr. R&amp;D said, and within a short time stalks, trunks, branches, roots, leaves began popping up all over the Earth.</p> <p>The only problem was that when one of these trees reached the end of its natural life, bacteria and fungal spores got ready to decompose it, sharpening their knives. But when they got to the lignin, their knives stuck: They couldn’t digest the lignin. The very thing that made lignin strong defeated the bacteria and fungi back then. So, they did what we do when we eat a chicken dinner: They ate all the meat and left the bones, which is to say: the lignin.</p><p>Eventually another tree would die and fall on top of the first, and then the same thing would happen again, and another and another, and it kept going like this for hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions of years. In the end, over 100 million years of dead trees and ferns and undigested lignin were deposited under the surface of the Earth. We call the time when most of this happened the Carboniferous (carbon-making) age.</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17341_c9dcf2529a5f4bf66234540fbe60b74e.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BUG OUT:</strong> Around 300 million years ago, there was so much oxygen that insects, who have inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies (seen here in a lifesize model in Italy) had a wingspan of about three feet.</span><span>life_in_a_pixel / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember how evolution sometimes has unforeseen consequences? Well, this deposit of lignin produced an oxygen surge in the atmosphere. Because for every hydrocarbon atom that goes into the Earth, an oxygen atom is not used up in the decay process. Massive amounts of carbon (lignin) were going into the Earth, so massive amounts of oxygen were building up in the atmosphere. Today, oxygen is 21 percent of the atmosphere. But around 300 million years ago, oxygen was well over 30 percent. There was so much oxygen that insects, who have very inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies had a wingspan of three feet, millipedes were eight feet long. Amphibians—frogs and such—also have inefficient lungs, and they were able to get as big as dining room tables.<br></p><p>The microorganisms of the time eventually became aware of this surge in oxygen. The insects and the amphibians didn’t seem to care, because they were dependent on that rich source of oxygen. So the now-worried microorganisms got their committee (MC) together and went to see Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello, what I can do for you?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: We think there is a dangerous situation developing, because oxygen levels have gotten higher every year and they might now be at 35 percent.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: So?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: With indigestible lignin, there is nothing to keep it from continuing to go up.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: I see your point, because at 43 percent a lightning strike will cause the entire atmosphere to ignite since it is so high in flammable oxygen. And the whole experiment of life on Earth will be over. Yes, I agree we have to do something. Give me a million years and I’ll see what I can do.</p> <p><i>For a million years, oxygen levels continue to rise. The even more worried microorganisms come back to Mr. R&amp;D.</i></p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: The bad news is I don’t have anything physical to give you. But I can give you a koan.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What’s that?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: A koan is something you can think of that will help you in …</p></div></div>

<p>Pijul for VS Code is an extension for Visual Studio Code which adds integration with Pijul as a source control management system.</p>
<p>Why develop my own extension instead of contributing to the existing one? It didn't even occur to me to check if one already existed
when I started, and when I did my own extension had enough distinct features to set it apart.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>At present, this extension offers <em>most</em> of the basic features necessary for local Pijul development on a single channel. It includes basic
commands for initializing a repository in a VS Code workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, Reset, or Record one, some, or all of the files in the Pijul Repository.</li>
<li>Decorations in the file tree indicating the current state of each file.</li>
<li>VS Code comparison integration for diffing files with their last recorded versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else still needs to be done on the command line.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requires an existing Pijul installation. <a href="https://pijul.org/manual/installing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instructions for installing Pijul can be found here</a>.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the Source Control View, deleted files show up as their parent directory (This is the result of a Pijul CLI limitation)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code hasn't been published on the extension marketplace yet, so it needs to be built and installed from the source.
To do so, folloow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Install Visual Studio Code Extensions (VSCE)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>npm install -g vsce
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Package the extension</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>vcse package
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." to install the VSIX file you created in the last step </li>
</ol>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>With the eventual goal of releasing on the Extension Marketplace with the same level of quality as other source control extensions,
there are a number of areas which will require a great deal of further refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper handling of VS Code workspaces with multiple folders</li>
<li>Automatic detection of Pijul installations</li>
<li>More robust .ignore file handling</li>
<li>Greater configurability</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of Pijul features which still need implementation to reach a publishable minimum viable product, suitable for local Pijul development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amending changes</li>
<li>Moving and removing files</li>
<li>Ignore file mangagement</li>
<li>Basic change log</li>
<li>Basic channel management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long term, I would like to offer more in-depth Pijul integration, with the goal of providing a better experience than can be offered on the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote management</li>
<li>Inline <code>pijul credit</code> annotations</li>
<li>IntelliJ style changeset system</li>
<li>Splitting/Combining existing changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category probably could probably fit a couple more points that I haven't thought of.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code welcomes all contributions. Before contributing, please be sure to add the following hook to your Pijul config file:</p>
<pre><code>[hooks]
record = ["yarn run lint --fix"]
</code></pre>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Global Unique Identifiers</a> (GUIDs), also known as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) can be used as practically unique identifiers in systems.</p><p>GUIDs have many advantages. You can safely generate identifiers in a distributed setting, compared to a central identifier registrar. Many systems are vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">Insecure Direct Object Reference</a> attacks, and even though permissions should always be checked for any access, it’s much easier to exploit these with sequential IDs compared to GUIDs (<a href="http://debarghyadas.com/writes/hacking-into-the-indian-education-system/">a high profile example</a>). Sequential IDs can leak <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14524061">important information</a>. Modern databases have custom <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html">in-built</a> UUID types which have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29882952/3399432">less storage overhead</a> and perform better than using a text type. There’s tons of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">blogs</a> extolling the benefits of GUIDs.</p><p>But anecdotally, there’s too many cases where raw GUIDs are used as identifiers, even though they might not be the appropriate choice.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>By their nature, GUIDs are opaque values that don’t lend too much information about what they’re identifying. They’re also generally unergonomic due to their length and structure. It’s almost trivially obvious that GUIDs shouldn't be in URLs due to their <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls">poor aesthetics</a>. To steal an example from <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/">Coding Horror</a>, database queries at the REPL can become frustrating.</p><pre><code>$ select * where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}'</code></pre><p>Poorly formatted log statements/errors can become harder to debug, since the identifiers don’t tell us what they’re identifying: </p><pre><code><code>error processing BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10: nil</code></code></pre><p>This can be mitigated by having libraries that report stack traces/line numbers and help identify the exact line of code with the error, so in general, UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of type safety of using raw integers and raw UUIDs can cause <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/27/uid/">horrifying problems</a> and is emblematic of lack of type safety with identifiers. With poor naming in code, it’s very easy to cause problems. Consider a variation of the example from the linked blog:</p><pre><code>def get_team_and_user_ids() -&gt; List[Tuple[UUID, UUID]]:
  """Returns a tuple of (team_id, user_id) tuples"""
  ...

def ban(user_id: UUID) -&gt; None: ...

for (user, team) in get_team_and_user_ids():
    ban(user)</code></pre><p>The script might just error out since UUIDs between users and teams aren’t shared, but the consequences might have been worse with integer IDs.</p><h2>Designing your Identifiers</h2><p>Identifiers should be designed for the properties of object they’re going to be identifying. We can mix and match components based on the importance of mutability, debuggability, performance and privacy for the object. For example, identifiers for permanent or external objects like customers should be treated differently to ephemeral or internal objects like tasks/jobs.</p><p><strong>Structure identifiers with prefixes and hierarchies</strong></p><p>Often for internal objects, debuggability is key, and prefixes can help with debugging. For example, all task identifiers could have the prefix “task-”. This automatically makes context free debugging easier, and makes it easy to grep for all messages that have IDs:</p><pre><code>error processing task-2: nil</code></pre><p>Hierarchies help even more with debuggability. Let’s say that every “Job” spawns N “Tasks”. Tasks IDs might want to contain their job IDs, so that it becomes trivially simple to grep for tasks of a particular job. For example, a task ID would look like: `job-123-task-1`. This also helps in ad-hoc database queries to find relevant rows without complex JOINs. We have examples of this in real life, like area codes in phone numbers.</p><p>We can add constant prefixes/hierarchies to any existing ID type. Critics might point out that storing a prefix with a UUID is wasteful since we’d lose the benefits of database optimized UUID types. This can easily be mitigated by storing un-prefixed UUID in the database, and application code automatically prepends a prefix for client code to use, but this might add some complexity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content Addressability</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, we want a zero inconsistency approach to storing objects, so it might make sense to make the identifier (or part of it) the checksum of the content that is to be stored. This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified. Git does this with SHA1 commit hashes (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/">even though this is being migrated to SHA256 as of December 2020</a>). <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (build system) uses a Content Addressable Store for <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Semi sortability</strong></p><p>If you need basic sortability and don’t mind the privacy concerns, consider using a scheme like Segment’s <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">KSUID</a>. This side-steps use of sequential IDs which will be painful to migrate away from. <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid#2-collision-free-coordination-free-dependency-free">UUID1 has some known issues</a>.</p><h2>Type Safety</h2><p>At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs. SQLAlchemy, a database manipulation library in Python, lets user implement a custom <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator">TypeDecorator</a> (and has native support for Postgres UUIDs). Let’s reproduce an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398042/3399432">example</a> with some tweaks:</p><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import uuid
from typing import NewType

db = SQLAlchemy()

FooId = NewType("FooId", bound=UUID)

class Foo(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(FooId(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, 
                   default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</code></pre><p>With a custom type “FooId” being marked as the column type, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">type checking</a> will prevent other ID types or raw UUID types there.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’ve seen that there’s a fair amount of complexity involved in id management and decision making. Some high scale applications end up deploying <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">custom ID generation</a> services. Identifiers are an early, hard to reverse decision that affect even schemaless datastores, so they’re worth thinking about in advance, and the right decision can compound developer productivity and prevent painful infrastructure migrations down the road.</p></div></div>]]>

        <section>
            <div><p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a solid remote access tool. IMO it's a key enabling technology for distributed systems. However it's effective security is not ideal. It's authentication scheme with RSA key pairs and wire-level encryption is great. But key management is tricky, and opening the firewall(s) for bidirectional SSH (port 22) increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>This article describes an AWS innovation introduced in 2019 called the session manager. Yes, you really can improve that mouse trap. The session manager adds to ssh a layer of authentication and authorization based on IAM and only requires HTTPS <em>outbound</em> on the server end. SSH rides on top of the Session Manager via SSH's proxy capability.</p>
<p>Now, remote host access might be on the wane. Cloud native is trending us towards managed platforms (cloud functions, serverless, container orchestrators), where it is discouraged, if not impossible, to start a shell. But for now, we still need it.</p>
<p>Let us level set first on SSH before we get into SSH proxied via the Session Manaager.</p>

<p>Straight, plain-vanilla SSH has a client and a server component, communicating over the SSH protocol. A shell session is initiated to a server-side user account, and authenticated either by a password or private key whose public key has been pre-authorized on the server:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh"></p>
<p>Note that ssh client is usually a bundle of tools: secure shell, file transfer and copy (ssh, sftp and scp). All three use the above architecture.</p>
<p>For reference, starting the session looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{public-ip-or-fqdn}
</code></pre>

<p>AWS offers session manager clients as part of the AWS CLI (with an add on) and the Console (Browser interface). The client and server communicate over HTTPS and secure web sockets, via the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) gateway:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct"></p>
<p>A few points to reemphasize here:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is effectively no risk of inbound attack. The firewall (security group and/or network acl) only needs an 443 outbound rule. The ssm agent on the EC2 Instances poll the gateway for session requests.</li>
<li>You can remove jumphosts altogether, or at least move them to private subnets. These instances need no public IP, and outbound access is enabled via a NAT gateway.</li>
<li>It's easier to harden authentication and manage credentials at scale. Console password rules (complexity, expiry), CLI access key rules (expiry) and use of MFA can be centralized. With AWS SSO or cross-account role assumption, each user has one set of credentials to use and rotate. Of course on and off-boarding is simplified as well.</li>
<li>You can more easily authorize access. SSH keys are often shared across hosts for convenience. IAM policies can be configured to limit access based on instance ids, tags, subnets, etc. on a per-user, per-role or per-group basis.</li>
<li>You can more easily audit access for forensics or integrate DevSecOps processes. Session lifecycle is logged in CloudTrail, and you can log to S3 the <em>full</em> shell history (both commands typed <em>and</em> responses displayed).</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="iamuser">IAM User</h2>
<ol>
<li>An IAM policy. I like using to use this set:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetConnectionStatus",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:DescribeSessions",
                "ssm:StartSession",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceProperties"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerStartDescribe"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:TerminateSession"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:session/${aws:username}-*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerTerminate"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above allows a user to list all current and historical sessions. Last I checked (Nov 2019), you cannot restrict DescribeInstances to those started by the user, but it does fortunately restrict entry termination to those the user has started.</p>
<p>You have to choose between users being able to view all current sessions (but not enter or terminate them) and viewing none at all. Same for historical sessions.</p>
<h2 id="ec2instance">EC2 Instance</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An SSM agent. It's pre-installed with the Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for Windows Server, Ubuntu Server 16 and 18, Amazon Linux 1 and 2, and all the AL variants for Batch, ECS, ElasticBeanstalk, etc. However, it has taken AWS many months to roll out the latest agent that supports SSH Proxying. Last I checked (Nov 2020), Ubuntu 16 supports direct but not proxied ssh. (Run <code>snap refresh amazon-ssm-agent</code> in your user data or other bootstrap mechanism to update it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM policy via an ec2 instance profile (role). The AWS doc on this is a little scattered. I like to use this set:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerCore"
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:ListInstanceAssociations",
                "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to log session data (shell history), you'll need another set of permissions, e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>Assign the profile (role) to the ec2 instance. If you assign the role after the instance started, bounce the ssm agent to get it connected to the backend.</p>

<p>Now let's bring in our trusty ssh, scp and sftp.</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh"></p>
<p>You can also use this approach for:</p>
<ol>
<li>custom users with non-default authorized ssh keys</li>
<li>custom users with password only authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>The proxy config for Linux (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
</code></pre>
<p>For Windows/OpenSSH (<code>C:\Users\{username}\.ssh\config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=%p"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple aws profiles configured, export (set in Windows Powershell) the AWS_PROFILE variable prior to starting the session.</p>
<p>So now we can use the instance id, instead of the public ip or fqdn:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{instance-id}
</code></pre>
<p>It will look and feel just like a straight ssh session. Occassionally starting the session takes a few seconds, but the performance from there on is just as good as ssh, in my experience.</p>
<p>All the other facilities, like scp and sftp, and remote execution of a command, are available as well. Also you can use the bundled ssh-add utility to store your keys in a cache and drop the -i option.</p>

<p>What about access to data stores, like private RDS or Elasticsearch/Kibana instance? You can use your client tools, like a MySQL Workbench in the case of RDS MySQL, or a browser in the case of Kibana. You connect them to a local port, e.g. 3306 or 8443, that is an open ssh tunnel riding on the session manager.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts access from the MySQL CLI client to a MySQL RDS:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1"></p>

<p>You can amend the user policy to restrict access. My two favorites follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whitelist specific people in a common policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerDenyRestricted",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-0cdbc0106ed03bba5",
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-07e8b9fc88ee02bf8"
            ]
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:username": "first.last1",
                    "aws:username": "first.last2"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use a group or role reference.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Whitelist categories of instances in a user- or group-specific policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "StartSessionResourceTag",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ssm:resourceTag/Purpose": "jumpbox"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Of course you then have to restrict ec2 instance tag updates to admins.</p>
<p>Refer to these <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-restrict-access-quickstart.html">quick start policies</a> for more.</p>

<p>By default, all session start and end is logged to CloudTrail, like all AWS service activity. You could enable some DevSecOps process on using CloudWatch event rules, like looking for .</p>
<p>You can enable session data logging to an S3 bucket, but take care! The content is highly sensitive. For example, users may type passwords in shell command arguments and cat files with PHI data. Therefore the logs must be sent to a well guarded bucket, e.g. in an audit account that is only allowed temporarily access by forensics investigators.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1"></p>
<p>AWS Session Manager enables us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>harden our systems (reduce the attack surface, use multi-factor authentication and fine-grained authorization)</li>
<li>centralize identity and access management</li>
<li>centralize audit</li>
</ol>
<p>And all this with no degredation in the user experience.</p>
<p>IMO, it's a win-win for dev, ops and security teams.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>To say I was a gamer in my teenage years is an understatement. However, the gaming scene today is vastly different, and it's clear from Twitch and YouTube gaming that people really enjoy watching others play. For me, gaming has always been about the stories and the worlds that provides an escape from the present world. Second to that, I enjoy conversing with friends about all things gaming.</p><p>I am an adult now with responsibilities towards work and family. My passion for games got lost along the way. People say, if you really are passionate, you will make time. This is true to a certain extent. Life isn't always that simple.</p><p>Anyway, earlier this year, I was searching for a place where the topic of conversation is gaming without the negativity of the real world. Three of us (similar age and jobs) found comfort in <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>. I take full credit for this idea and execution because when I initially suggested Basecamp; I was told, the last thing we need in our life is another corporate app. The idea is to escape work. It's all a matter of perspective, one needs to look at a software objectively and use it for your use case.</p><h2 id="what-is-basecamp">What is Basecamp?</h2><p>Well, in this case, it's a one-stop shop for all things gaming between close friends. <em>In the real world, Basecamp is a premier project management + internal communication tool for remote WFH teams worldwide.</em> With over 3.3 million Basecamp accounts created, it seems well regarded in the project management world etc. I am no expert, but I am responsible for 10 of the 3.3 million Basecamp accounts, and we do not use these for work or any revenue generating activities.</p><h2 id="why-basecamp-personal">Why Basecamp Personal?</h2><ul><li>Multi Platform — Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and any modern browser</li><li>Privacy focused</li><li>Free</li><li>Flexible and modular</li></ul><p>We all work in big corporations, and you wouldn't believe that most apps/services are blocked by our IT department. On the other hand, Basecamp works perfectly.</p><p>At first, we were cautious of using Basecamp for free because, as you know, nothing in life is free. If you do not pay financially, you will pay through sacrificing your privacy and/or data (🤔 Gmail, Facebook etc). Fortunately, <strong>some things in life are still free with no other costs, and Basecamp Personal is a delightful example of this.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-we-use-basecamp">How we use Basecamp?</h2><p><em>Note: My friends were not keen on making our Basecamp setup public, so I attempted to recreate it and basing the characters in this story on David and Jason (<strong>for light-hearted fun only</strong>) to give you an example of how we use Basecamp Personal.</em></p><p><em>The ease of account creation is the single most reason I attempted to recreate our Basecamp setup. In addition, Basecamp only asked for my name and email address. Nothing else! No credit cards, no secret questions, no personally identifiable information. <strong>It's actually nice to have your privacy respected.

Replaying this together again in our adulthood, resurfaced memories of the time when all we did was enjoy and have fun in each other’s company through our passion for gaming.</p><p>Using Basecamp, we organised when we will play online, our respective characters and argued over who will pick which character. We also discussed our childhood memories. It’s fascinating because each of us vividly remembered stories that the others had forgotten. We shared Easter eggs we found. The music and the overall feel of the game is an enormous walk down nostalgia street.</p><h2 id="basecamp-for-task-management">Basecamp for Task Management</h2><p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things by Culture Code</a> is my task management app of choice and has been for over 2 years now. As much as I enjoy using Things, it bugs me that I cannot use it at work (Windows) and cannot attach files to my tasks. I actually tried to move to Basecamp for all things task management but the limitation of 3 projects (5 would be ideal) and lack of repeating tasks was a dealbreaker and the paid up version is $99 a month which is out of the question for me.</p><p>I will say this, if it suits your workflow, Basecamp Personal is excellent for personal task management. It's extremely flexible, intuitive, collaborative (up to 20 users), well designed and a very reliable service.</p><p>Considering how unreliable our current corporate solution is, I pitched Basecamp to my organisation’s IT head. It’s likely this will gain any traction as changing software for an organisation of 30,000 people is no easy task.</p><p>My intention behind this post is to demonstrate the importance of having an open mind and think outside the box, thus allowing you to objectively evaluative the best use of tools in your arsenal. Basecamp is viewed as a business software solution. However, it's clear from my use case, that one shouldn't pigeonhole software into categories.</p><h5 id="my-heartfelt-thanks-to-the-entire-team-of-basecamp-and-the-founders-for-providing-basecamp-personal-free-of-charge">My heartfelt thanks to the entire team of Basecamp and the founders for providing Basecamp Personal free of charge</h5>

December 30, 2020 | https://questinglog.com/2020-year-in-review/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://questinglog.com/2020-year-in-review/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>2020 was my second full year running <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a> as a screencasting business, and it enjoyed some growth. Looking at my dashboards, it's fallen short of the <a href="https://questinglog.com/2019-year-in-review">goals I set last year</a>, but it's still considerable progress given all that's happened.
<small>(Disclaimer: These numbers haven't been audited and are simply what I've pulled from various accounts and spreadsheets. The year isn't quite over, either)</small></p> <p>Alchemist Camp is a site with many screencasts for programmers learning Elixir. Most of them are free and on <a href="https://youtube.com/alchemistcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, but many are restricted to paying subscribers. I've also launched a couple of adjacent products.</p> <h2 id="_2020-goals-recap"><a href="#_2020-goals-recap">#</a> 2020 goals recap</h2> <p>I had set four goals for 2020:</p> <ol><li>Double gross subscription sales to $28k</li> <li>Keep lifetime retention above 60%</li> <li>Launch the second product I've been working on before the first of March</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference</li></ol> <p><strong>#1 (miss)</strong>: Growth has been very slow since March.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/growth-chart-2020.d126cd0d.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p><strong>#2 (barely)</strong>: Retention of existing subscribers was decent, and barely cleared goal #2 as long as people who subscribed and churned multiple times only count as a single churn.</p> <p><strong>#3 (hit)</strong>: I got a 2nd product launched by March! It was the <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit</a> I'd already announced would be a freebie for my existing Alchemist Camp subscribers last Black Friday.</p> <p><strong>#4 (miss)</strong>: I've been in Taiwan all year since arriving from Japan at the end of February and wasn't able to make it to an Elixir conference in the US. I won't count this one due to the pandemic.</p> <h2 id="new-products"><a href="#new-products">#</a> New products</h2> <p>I released two new products this year, both for Elixir devs.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter"><a href="#phoenix-igniter">#</a> Phoenix Igniter</h3> <p>Phoenix Igniter is a <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit for building Phoenix apps</a> that includes various boilerplate code I've found myself writing repeatedly across projects. It's in beta, and is useful for me but I'm having a hard time getting any user feedback.</p> <p>Thus far, it's been entirely driven by what I want on my own projects. It's a one-time purchase product, so sales are very spikey. I gave it away to every Alchemist Camp subscriber during Black Friday of 2019, so there are considerably more users than paying customers.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/igniter-chart-2020.21f716f4.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>I have high hopes for Igniter. Ultimately, I can see it appealing to a much broader group of devs than my screencast subscriptions on Alchemist Camp can.</p> <h3 id="_5-little-potions"><a href="#_5-little-potions">#</a> 5 Little Potions</h3> <p>5 Little Potions is an <a href="https://alchemist.camp/little-potions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebook for beginner Elixir learners</a> and I'm currently about 45% of the way writing it. I had a few goals in starting this book. First of all, I wanted to have something substantial for beginners. About the first 15 screencasts or so I did for Alchemist Camp are aimed at beginners, but the last 150+ have been aimed more at peers and people digging into specific topics.</p> <p>I also felt like coding some games instead of just business-focused web apps!</p> <p>It hasn't brought in a lot of revenue, due to the low price, but I think it's a great way to reach more learners. As I finish the 3rd, 4th and 5th games in the book and get ready for its launch, I expect to see quite a few more people buy.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/potions-chart-2020.fe47bae1.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>Okay! Let's have a look at the stats...</p> <h2 id="financial-stats"><a href="#financial-stats">#</a> Financial stats</h2> <h3 id="alchemist-camp"><a href="#alchemist-camp">#</a> Alchemist Camp</h3> <ul><li>Alchemist Camp revenue: $18,846.63 (+35%)</li> <li>Wage per hour: ~$38 (+52%)</li> <li>Paying subscribers: 96 current</li> <li>Lifetime retention: 60%</li> <li>Expenses: $4901.56 (-1%)</li> <li><strong>Profits: $13,945.07 (+55%)</strong></li></ul> <h3 id="expenses-breakdown"><a href="#expenses-breakdown">#</a> Expenses Breakdown</h3> <ul><li>Stripe: $2,295.98</li> <li>ConvertKit: $441</li> <li>Digital Ocean: $316.86</li> <li>Domain names: $120</li> <li><strong>Services Total: $3,222.84</strong></li> <li>Technical books: $724.15 (Mostly Manning, Pragprog and No Starch Press)</li> <li>Screencasts and courses: $954.57 (about 50/50 business and technical)</li> <li><strong>Educational Total: $1,678.72</strong></li></ul> <p>This year's expenses ended up almost identical to last year. However the breakdown is very different. Stripe cost considerably more, due to a combination of higher volume, increased fees and using more services. In particular, Stripe moved its customers from Subscriptions (for which I was a free forever plan) to Billing, which has a percentage fee on every transaction.</p> <p>Another major cost increase was due to my moving from Mail Chimp to ConvertKit. I was spending $49/month for marketing email services for most of the year. It wasn't worth it for me in the end, so I migrated to SendFox.</p> <p>My educational spending was less than half what it was last year. That's not because I'm any less of a believer in investing in it, but mostly due to being behind my revenue goals and finding better bargains.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter-starter-kit"><a href="#phoenix-igniter-starter-kit">#</a> Phoenix Igniter (starter kit)</h3> <ul><li>Phoenix Igniter revenue: $1,140</li> <li>Stripe fees: $44.16</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,095.84</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-little-potions-ebook"><a href="#_5-little-potions-ebook">#</a> 5 Little Potions (ebook)</h3> <ul><li>5 Little Potions revenue: $1,575</li> <li>Gumroad fees: $129</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,446</li></ul>  <ul><li>YouTube Views: 77.7k (+26%)</li> <li>Monthly Unique Visitors: ~12k (excluding bots)</li> <li>Accounts created (all time): 4705</li></ul> <h2 id="big-wins"><a href="#big-wins">#</a> Big wins</h2> <ol><li>My RSI is nearly healed!</li> <li>Podcasting with Justin Vincent</li> <li>Overcoming crazy obstacles</li> <li>The idea muscle</li> <li>Doubling down on learning</li></ol> <h3 id="healing-wrists"><a href="#healing-wrists">#</a> Healing wrists</h3> <p>Three years and a month ago, I could barely use a phone or mouse at all. It hurt just to brush my teeth. I had <em>severe</em> repetitive stress injuries and was in a pretty bad bind.</p> <p>Even <a href="http://localhost:8080/2020-year-in-review/#wrists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, I was still far from better. It's a big part of why I've put so much time into reading, podcasting and other hands-free activities the past couple of years.</p> <p>But now, I'm finally feeling about 90%. I still do stretches and still do 100% of my computing from an ergonomic keyboard (or iPad + pencil), but I can actually bang out an 8-hour day of coding and typical computer use and feel okay the next day. I'm not pushing it, but I'm <em>thrilled</em> about the improvement!</p> <h3 id="the-reactor-am-podcast"><a href="#the-reactor-am-podcast">#</a> The Reactor.am podcast</h3> <p>The level of serendipity I experience in my life sometimes astounds me and this is one of those cases. In my yearly review last year, I wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>But then this spring, a funny thing happened. I got sucked into this long-running podcast called <a href="http://techzinglive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techzing</a> and started listening to the archives (which go back ten years) and I heard some interviews they did with Amy Hoy.</p></blockquote> <p>Well, things have progressed. I just finished recording the 44th episode of <a href="https://reactor.am/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactor.am</a>, a mastermind-based podcast a few hours ago. My co-host is Justin Vincent—one of the two co-hosts of Techzing. He's got far, far more entrepreneurial experience than I do and it's been a good learning experience.</p> <p>This certainly wasn't remotely a goal or something that even seemed within the realm of possibility a year ago, but it's been great! If we're living in a simulation, I'm pretty sure I'm a player character 😎</p> <h3 id="overcoming-crazy-obstacles"><a href="#overcoming-crazy-obstacles">#</a> Overcoming crazy obstacles</h3> <p>I was in Taiwan on a 90 day visa-free entry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PPfl4XRxh4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when borders started closing</a> due to the pandemic and managed to get an entrepreneur visa good for a year.</p> <p>Then later in the spring, my bank closed my account and disabled my debit card due to an error, while I was abroad... in the middle of the pandemic. That was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCra7EaPQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly a crisis</a> since 100% of my income flows through the account and I needed things like food, housing and water.</p> <p>But, I managed to hustle and overcome both obstacles mostly intact. All I lost was some sleep and some time. All-in-all, that's not bad for 2020.</p> <h3 id="the-idea-muscle"><a href="#the-idea-muscle">#</a> The idea muscle</h3> <p>I've been religiously sticking to James Altucher's <em>Idea Muscle</em> practice, picking a topic and generating at least 10 ideas every day. It seems like a small thing, but after a month or two, I really started feeling a difference. I attribute both the book I'm currently writing and my increased screencasting productivity to it.</p> <p>I've been doing all of it on an iPad and just using Apple notes with the pencil and it's been just as good in terms of writing, thinking and processing as a paper and pencil were last time I tried this but it's easier to save and review them.</p> <h3 id="doubling-down-on-learning"><a href="#doubling-down-on-learning">#</a> Doubling down on learning</h3> <p>I've continued aggressively trying to deepen my technical skills while picking up some new ones that will help me make progress as a founder. Humble Bundles and ebook purchases in general have been paying off the most.</p> <p>One great thing I've realized is that an iPad + pen is a near ideal tool for active reading. I can fearlessly highlight the heck out of any book I read and later erase any highlights I don't want to keep.</p> <h2 id="what-didn-t-go-so-well"><a href="#what-didn-t-go-so-well">#</a> What didn't go so well</h2> <ol><li>Growth</li> <li>Decision paralysis</li></ol> <h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth">#</a> Growth</h3> <p>My audience is growing just as slow as it was a year ago. I noted an increase in competition in the market then and it seems to have continued, likely in part due to the pandemic.</p> <p>At that time, I wasn't too concerned and saw such competition as likely to grow the market overall and mostly have little effect on me. Now I'm not so sure.</p> <p>Elixir is a <em>tiny</em> market, and I'm seeing the low-end of it getting flooded with new courses while the total number of people learning it or using at work is fairly flat.</p> <p>This is part of why I've broadened my business into adjacent territory with the book and the starter kit and why I'm looking at still other opportunities involving software as opposed to educational products.</p> <h3 id="decision-paralysis"><a href="#decision-paralysis">#</a> Decision paralysis</h3> <p>I know I can make faster progress than I have so far, but it's <em>very</em> difficult to evaluate what business efforts are worth investing time into.</p> <p>I'm currently evaluating a <em>lot</em> of options, including finding contract work and investing money as well as time into a project.</p> <br>   <br> <h2 id="goals-for-2021"><a href="#goals-for-2021">#</a> Goals for 2021</h2> <ol><li>Break $75k total revenue</li> <li>Launch a SaaS product, likely a micro-SaaS</li> <li>Find a banking setup I can rely on while living outside the US</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference???</li> <li>Grow sales in all three existing products</li></ol> <p>Despite everything, I'm feeling even more confident this year than I did last year. I may experience some pain revolving around banking and residency status again, but I'll find my way through it and keep investing in the long-term.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25587873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

December 30, 2020 | https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/stories/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/stories/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><p>When Snapchat launched Stories in October 2013, no one could have anticipated the ripple effect this would have across the software ecosystem. In the 7-years since its launch, every major consumer internet company has adopted its own flavor of Stories to give its users that familiar, lean back content consumption experience that they’ve grown accustomed to. Even though there’s no singular app that has monopolized consumer attention, it’s clear that the Story content format is the real winner of the mobile-first world. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6429b1d18aec12ac96faf585a80c0ac5d02672fc/20951/img/posts/stories/stories.png" alt="Examples of mobile stories formats"></p><p>The way companies with an ads-based business model make more money is relatively straightforward: get users to spend more time consuming relevant content and seeing more ads. For over a decade, consumer internet companies have been tweaking and improving upon the traditional feed-based content consumption model. First there was Google’s paginated results, followed by Facebook’s infinite scroll and Pinterest’s masonry grid. Each is designed to balance exploiting what the app already knows about its users with exploration of new topics adjacent to the user’s current preferences.</p><p>Stories were the first new discovery paradigm that completely changed the way social apps began to think about engaging with their users. Beyond just how users consume content, Stories also changed the way people thought about creating content. By making Stories temporal, the quality bar was lowered so users don’t have to overthink whether something they share should be a part of their permanent record on the internet. Suddenly, users weren’t worried about polluting their own self image (or their friends’ feeds) which made it a lot easier to create content at a much higher volume than they did with feed posts. </p><p>From a metrics perspective, it makes sense why this new paradigm is so attractive: Stories users end up spending more time in-app across more frequent sessions and end up direct messaging each other more, creating a virtuous feedback loop of engagement. In early 2019 Instagram reported that they had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/instagram-stories-500-million/">500 Million daily active users of Stories</a>, with 1 Billion monthly active users of the app overall! That DAU-to-MAU ratio is astounding, and something that’s understandably envious to the rest of the consumer app ecosystem.</p><p>While the cat’s out of the bag that Stories are the winning format for mobile, marketers are left scratching their heads about how to handle supporting all of these new native formats. Depending on a marketer’s type of business and target audience, they now has to deal with Instagram (Grid, Stories, Reels, IGTV), Snapchat, TikTok, Google (SEO, AMP Stories), Pinterest (Pins, Stories), Facebook (Posts, Stories), Twitter (Tweets, Fleets) and LinkedIn (Posts, Stories). </p><p>The proliferation of at-scale social networks presents a massive opportunity for marketers to reach their audience unlike ever before, but it comes with a very real cost. Each channel has its own rules, best practices and creative sizes which means a “one size fits all” approach just simply doesn’t work. Practically speaking this means that if a marketer wants to cross-promote a blog post across social networks today, they have to produce 4+ creative formats and publish it to 5+ channels. This leads to a meaningful decrease in velocity and increase in the time between publishing a blog post and actually being able to promote it. When combined with the fact that all of this hard work goes away after 24 hours, it’s clear that this is a very real challenge today.</p><p>Almost overnight, the bottleneck for marketers has become creating all of the design assets they need to maximize their reach and maintain their quality bar. Companies like the New York Times have dedicated 20+ person design teams just focused on solving this problem, but for the average company this isn’t even a distant possibility. More likely, the marketer has a shared design resource with other parts of the company, and is relegated to jump into design tools themselves to try and make ends meet. </p><p>Stories are the straw that broke the marketer’s back, and with their recent widespread adoption will come a new wave of products that are meant to make the process of generating stories and other social content dramatically easier. Today marketers have 3 choices for producing stories: native creation tools, templated design tools, or pro design tools. </p><p>We’re at the beginning of a new era of design tooling that generates beautiful, on-brand social content automatically. This fourth type of tool will let marketers remix their existing content into all of the relevant formats to power their social strategies. These tools won’t automate the role of the designer or marketer, but instead elevate their position from being the executor to the strategist. </p><p>Aesthetic’s generator tool is the first of its kind to do exactly this, and is able to auto-generate images and videos for use across all major formats today. We’re actively working with thought-leading marketers across a wide range of industries and are onboarding new users every week.

<p>Traditionally at the year end I like to note most significant trends that I see unfolding in the DevOps world. I did not know about the level of disruption that Covid would cause when I put “Remote Asynchronous Workforce” on the <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/01/04/devops-2020-tectonic-shift/">last year’s list</a>. As we now know this actually turned out to be the #1 trend of 2020, which to me actually was the brightest spot of the otherwise grim year.</p>



<p>Now, going to 2021 here are the trends that I would like to highlight:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Bundles and Software Bills of Materials.</strong> The industry is actively looking to automate push-button deployments but at the same time preserving transparency and traceability of software components. From the one side we want a black box with the whole suite of what we are deploying. From the other side we want to be able to quickly replace a component which security or stability was compromised. That’s why bundles are so important. Read more about bundles in my recent post <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/11/15/devops-bundles-new-name-of-the-game/">here</a>.<br></li><li><strong>Complexity vs Simplicity paradox.</strong> Business wants simplicity and quick roll-outs of ad-hoc software components. To achieve that they are actively looking at so-called “no-code” or “low-code” tools. Similarly, in DevOps world “Serverless” or “No-Ops” tools become increasingly popular. At the same time, this approach creates a huge scalability gap between initial prototyping and production deployments. This problem is only starting to unfold and I expect we would be hearing more about it in 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Vertical integration in DevOps vs “Best Tool for the Job”.</strong> Philosophy of DevOps tooling is currently split between companies like GitLab who are pushing for single suite of tools to handle all your DevOps needs and many others who build specialized tools which do better job in their niches. I wrote a post about this some time ago <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/03/20/lego-world-no-1-devops-solution-fits-all/">here</a>. What I currently observe is increased marketing effort from companies advocating vertical integration to gain market share. I believe in the end of a day this is harmful to the overall software quality and that the “Best Tool for the Job” approach would be the preferred one. But in any case it would be interesting to observe the community reaction to this marketing push.<br></li><li><strong>Widening gap between high performers and low performers.</strong> Not sure if this will happen in 2021 or a little later, but there is a growing sense of urgency for low performers to do better or be wiped out by competition. Essentially, the trend we are waiting for is mass migration of low performers (in DevOps terms) to modern tooling and modern philosophies. This creates massive challenge and massive opportunity at the same time for DevOps practitioners.<br></li><li><strong>Kanban.</strong> Kanban is often more appropriate than Scrum for DevOps-oriented organizations. Still, the adoption level of Kanban remains sub-par to that of Scrum. However, I see the trend that this is changing. People enjoy Kanban boards and gradually move to adopt wider Kanban principles (starting with things like WIP-limits).<br></li><li><strong>CI is the new Version Control – CD will come next. </strong>These days it is hard to imagine a software project without version control. And starting one is as simple as typing “git init”. Now with Dockerfile, Continuous Integration piece is not much harder. So essentially, every piece of software now relies on working Version Control <strong>and </strong>its Continuous Integration pipeline. These are pretty much 2 things you do right away when you start a software project. And I believe this trend will be solidified in 2021. Continuous Delivery would come later, but it will come inevitably. See my post on <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/06/04/7-best-practices-modern-cicd/">best CI/CD practices</a> for more details on the current state of things.</li></ol>



<p>I believe these are the most important trends that are happening right now in the DevOps world. Happy 2021, I truly hope it would be much happier than 2020!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>It all started at my first job. I’ve been around 6 months in the company and was happy getting used to the ropes of my current job. In those 6 months, I quickly pushed to prod (without even knowing it) and was learning very fast. I still remember when my boss called me to his office: We are going to do some changes and you’ll lead this new 3 person team. I thought to myself: Cool, I’ve learned some books about leadership, this could be fun.</p>



<p>The tricky part was the members of the team. They were a couple of technicians who had more than ten years on the job and more than twenty years in the company ( I was twenty years old). One of them was even a team lead recently. I did not understand the mechanics of that re-org at the time and still don’t have all the information about what was happening. I wish I had some cool story about why I was chosen to lead the team, really don’t know.</p>



<p>It was not a walk in the park, things started to get ugly before they could get better. As expected they pushed back a lot, they did not like the change, me, or anything that was happening. It’s funny, looking back I think my ego should have been hurt based on all the times they tried to avoid working with me and change things. I guess I was so confused with everything that I had no time for that.</p>



<p>When we started to work together, one thing was clear: they were not in the mood to take orders from a kid. I was not in the mood to give orders to them. This particular situation helped me a lot and shaped the way I work ten years later.</p>



<p>Given that it was almost impossible to give orders and avoid starting a world war. I started listening, that’s what I did the most in the first weeks. I listened and asked questions. Not like interrogations, more like curious questions. I think the key to the questions what that I wanted to learn from them. I was not a trick, I was very interested in what they were doing.</p>



<p>I still remember some kind of pranks they pulled on me. They would tell me they had run out of a particular material they needed. I had made a lot of calls and research to try to find it for them, then they magically found some in the warehouse or the car they used. I did not know these were pranks, I learned later when they had another team lead (I laughed that time).</p>



<p>With some retrospective, I think these pranks were not just to pick on the new guy. I think they were testing me. They wanted to see what I did, would I forget about the problem, slack off, blame it on them, or take ownership and be part of the team. Most of the time I came with solutions and discussed alternatives with the team. Some weeks later I think they started to trust me.</p>



<p>There was a point where I started to notice that I could help with some things. Not so much in executing, but there were some things they needed help with. Mostly operational excellence. They were relieved to have someone handle that. Every week we were becoming a better team.</p>



<p>Patience was a foundation for this team. At least from my side. I did not rush things out (I was not even sure how to do that) and never try to impose my ideas or way of working. I trusted a lot the team and things started to look better.</p>



<p>Not everything was perfect. We had disagreements and sometimes we preferred different approaches. This is normal in all teams, the good part is that we started to have a process. We had a daily meeting, talked about what we needed to do that day and we talked briefly at the end of the day. Every side learned to cede sometimes and when months have passed we were playing by ear.</p>



<p>Even though we were a productive team and technically very respected, what I always treasure from these experiences is human relationships. I still have a great time whenever I talk to these two people and we have a blast remembering the good old days. Based on what they say, they learn a thing or two from me, but I learned a ton from them and that experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I came across this <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1204031.pdf">paper</a> which looks at ways to teach students complex systems courtesy of Jessica Kerr’s <a href="https://jessitron.com/2020/10/11/clockwork-to-complexity-scale-in-time-and-software/">blog</a>.</p><p>Based on how students reason about complex systems, they were placed in 4 categories in order of increasing sophistication: <em>Completely Clockwork, Somewhat Clockwork, Somewhat Complex and Completely Complex</em>.</p><p>“Clockwork responses are those that show deterministic, linear, single-cause, non-networked, centralized, or static system interactions or states, whereas complex responses are those that demonstrate nondeterministic, nonlinear, multiple causes, networked, decentralized, or dynamic system interactions or states”.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/325111ba-e7ab-4fb2-8bb1-743e63fe634d_1600x632.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In my experience this translates extremely well to the progression of a developer and their understanding of the complexity of the ecosystem they operate in. So, I wanted to attempt to derive a learning progression for developers.</p><p>At each level of development, I recommend a few books. Each book hopefully is a thread you can pull on, if you want to go deeper into a particular topic.The book recommendations are subjective, but I believe that one can chart their own curriculum following the basic model. The recommendations that I make are just based on my own experience and aim to serve merely as guidance.</p><p><strong>Completely Clockwork</strong></p><p>My recommendations for this level would be:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rDymed">Refactoring</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2L4q3HJ">Clean Architecture</a></p></li></ul><p>At this level most of the work is involved in making changes in a single service or component. This is where most of the <em>‘coding’</em> happens. The amount of time that will be spent reading your code will be multiples of the amount you would take to write it. You will work more with existing code rather than writing new code. A corollary of this fact is that you need to know how to make your code easy to change.So your focus should be on writing readable code and making it easy to change. With these considerations in mind, I recommend the following books&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somewhat Clockwork</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rFMkfH">Designing Data Intensive Applications&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o1QDjf">Building Microservices</a></p></li></ul><p>Distributed systems are ubiquitous. Even when you are making a change to a single service, that service most likely lives in an ecosystem of other services and a plethora of other distributed tools. As you grow in seniority you need to understand how best to interact with other services in your vicinity and also the tradeoffs involved with each tool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somewhat Complex</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eAl7">Domain Driven Design</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o2KenM">Team Topologies</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3mYTWpZ">SRE Book&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eWrX">Accelerate&nbsp;</a></p></li></ul><p>We are now in the scope of system of systems. A practitioner operating mostly at this level needs to be able to use models to explain the system and its interactions. These models are not just to explain the software system but also the teams that surround that software. You need to understand the best models for organizing teams to drive maximum impact. Additionally, as the operator of <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">complex systems</a> they wear two hats : that of the producer and that of the protector against failure. The practitioner needs to be able to handle this duality well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Completely Complex</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">Wardley Maps</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/38Msirg">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></p></li></ul><p>According to the paper, a completely complex system is a dynamic process, which is constantly in a state of flux. Any patterns here are emergent. Changes have both short term and long term repercussions. You also realize that the system is self organized for the most part. This sounds a lot like the modern organization. At this scope you are typically operating as the technical leadership. You need to be able to form technical strategies grounded in the needs of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>So to summarize, this is what we end up with as a progression plan for developers over varying degrees of complexity.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div></div></div>]]>

This post is a part of a series on x86-64 assembly programming that I'm writing.

</i>
</p>


<p>
Well, I'm finally bringing this series back from a months-long hiatus! In the
<a href="https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-2.txt.html">last post</a>, we started implementing an
emulator for a simple instruction set of our own. We sketched out the overall
architecture, and implemented a few instructions for moving data between virtual
registers and memory, learning about the corresponding x86-64 instructions
along the way. In this one, I want to focus on arithmetic and logic operations,
which will allow our emulator to do stuff that is a bit more interesting than
just moving bytes around. But before we jump into that, I want to briefly talk 
about how numbers are represented in a computer.
</p>

<h2>Number Representation</h2>

<p>
If you've made it this far in the tutorial, chances are that you understand the
basics of how the binary notation for numbers works, and don't need an
explanation of what bits and bytes are. So I'm not going to spend time on that.
</p>

<p>
However, there are some particular details related to representing signed
integers. Theoretically, this topic should be a part of any computer
science curriculum. But not every coder has a formal CS background, and even
among those that do, most either don't remember or have never encountered
these things in practice - because one simply doesn't have to think about them
for the vast majority of time when programming computers.
</p>

<p>
But number representation <i>is</i> important for understanding the arithmetic
instructions that we're going to be looking at; therefore, I feel like I can't
simply gloss over the topic.
</p>

<p>
If you already know how signed integers work in most computers, this might be a
good refresher, otherwise you might learn something new!
</p>

<h2>Representing Integers</h2>

<p>
Computers can't represent "numbers" in the abstract, mathematical sense.
They're finite, discrete machines and there's not enough memory in the world to
store a representation of an arbitrarily large quanitity, or even the
representation of a rather small, but "weird" quantity like
<a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">tau</a>.
</p>

<p>
We cope with that limitation by conceding that we'll never be able to represent
an arbitrary number. Instead, we use the resources at our disposal to represent
a subset of all numbers. We look at all the bit strings of a fixed
length, and agree that each of them represents a particular number.
However many different bit strings we can deal with, that's how many different
numbers we can represent.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can represent 256 distinct numbers using 8 bits, because there
are 256 different bit strings of length 8. Generally speaking, it is entirely up
to our interpretation <i>which</i> 256 numbers these strings represent.
For example, you could decide to interpret each of the 8 bits as a binary digit,
so that the entire 8-bit bitstring is nothing more than its corresponding
number, written out using the binary numeral system. On the other hand, you
might decide that the first 6 bits specify the "whole" part of the number, and
the remaining 2 bits specify the "fractional" part (this is called fixed-point
representation and used to be commonplace before the wide spread of
hardware-accelerated floating point arithmetic). It all depends on which subset
of numbers interests you at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
Certain instructions of a given processor have baked-in assumptions about the
representation used by their parameters, and behave accordingly. For example,
the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/addps">addps</a> SSE instruction
assumes that its parameters are floating point numbers adhering to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard. We're
more interested in instructions doing simple integer arithmetic, but those also
assume a certain representation, as we're about to see.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at some of the possible ways to represent integers in a
computer. For the sake of simplicity and readability, I am going to use eight
bits for everything, but all of this extends to a larger number of bits in a
straightforward manner.
</p>

<p>
In case of positive integers, the simple and straightforward mapping is to
just use a given integer's binary representation, as we've mentioned before.
If the representation doesn't take all of the available eight bits, we'll pad
out the number with zeroes from the left (the additional whitespace in the
middle of the bit string is added just for readability):
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2</td><td>10</td><td>0000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>3</td><td>11</td><td>0000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>4</td><td>100</td><td>0000 0100</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
So far, so good. But things start to get sticky when we introduce negative
numbers into the mix. How would you represent a number like -5? Sure, if you
were doing math with a pencil and a piece of paper, you could just write "-101"
instead of "-5" and be done with it, but you can't exactly do that with a
computer.
</p>

<p>
The initial instinct might be to use the leftmost (most significant) bit to
indicate the sign. If the very first bit of a bit string is 0, then we assume the number to be
positive. If it is 1, we assume the number to be negative.
This way of coding signed numbers is called "sign-and-magnitude representation"
and it was used in some very old machines.
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-3</td><td>-11</td><td>1000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-2</td><td>-10</td><td>1000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>1000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Astute readers might have noticed an interesting problem here.
We've assigned the string "0000 0000" to 0, but how are we to interpret the
string 1000&nbsp;0000? It's -0, so the effective value it represents is just 0.
It looks like we ended up with two representations for a zero - one "positive"
and one "negative".
</p>

<p>
While having two representations for the same number is kind of ugly, it's
actually the least of our worries. In fact, the standard for floating point,
IEEE 754, mentioned earlier, does have the notion of "negative zero", and it's
no big deal. But nevertheless, the sign-and-magnitude representation is not used
on any modern machine that I am aware of. That is because there is a <i>much</i>
better way of representing signed integers, that not only avoids having two
representations for 0, but actually ends up being much easier to deal with in
hardware. However, in order to really understand why this alternative
representation we're about to propose is better, we need to take a little
detour.
</p>

<h3>Learning to Add</h3>

<p>
Let's mentally put integer representation on the backburner for a minute.
Let's think about how CPUs work on the lowest possible level (the lowest that I
can grasp myself anyway).
</p>

<p>
The most basic component of a CPU is a switch that can be controlled by an
electrical current: when a current is present, the switch is ON, and when there
is no current present, the switch is OFF. You could build a crude switch like
that yourself using a few pieces of metal, insulation and some wire - it's
called a relay.
</p>

<p>
Some early machines might have used relays (which were huge and unreliable), but
modern machines use a different kind of switch - the transistor, which is 
semiconductor-based. It's extremely reliable, and can be made so tiny that 
it's possible to cram billions of these things into a small space. Still, the
principle is the same - a transistor is a simple switch, controlled by
electrical current, it's just miniscule in size.
</p>

<p>
By wiring switches together in a particular manner, one can build <i>logic
gates</i> - tangible hardware implementations of the AND/OR/NOT/XOR/etc.
functions that most programmers are familiar with. For example, here's a diagram
showing how you can build an OR logic gate from two switches:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/sw_OR_tmb.jpg">
<br>
<small><i>Image credit: simplecpudesign.com</i></small>
</p>

<p>
If any one of the switches (labelled A and B respectively) is turned on, the
output (labelled Z) will have current.
If both A and B are off, Z will have no current. Switches act as "operands" for
the logical OR operation, and the output Z represents the result.
</p>

<p>
Logic gates can be further wired together to make more complex circuits, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
So, fundamentally, a CPU is a giant collection of interconnected logic gates
that consist of tiny electrically operated switches. With that in mind, I invite
you to consider the question: how does a CPU actually do arithmetic? For
example, how does it add two positive integers?
</p>

<p>
Turns out, you can wire together logic gates to make circuits that can perform
arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider adding two single-bit numbers. Forget about negative numbers for
now, let's just handle positives. Note that result itself can be larger than
1 bit, so we'll add a second, "carryover" bit to it. There are only 4
possibilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>0 + 0 = 0 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>0 + 1 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 0 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 1 = 0 in the result bit, 1 in the carryover bit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The pattern in the result bits looks like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a> for a
familiar boolean operation - exclusive OR (aka XOR). The pattern in the
carryover bit looks like the truth table of a boolean AND operation. So, a
circuit for adding two single-bit values can be built with a XOR gate and an AND
gate. It's called a half-adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/ha.png">
</p>

<p>
When we try adding two 2-bit numbers, things start to get real hairy. We need to
take into account the carryover bit from adding the first two bits when adding
the second two bits. So we can't just string together two half-adders to add two
2-bit numbers. We need to design a circuit that adds <i>three</i> bits: two 
"regular" bits and one carryover bit from the previous single-bit addition.
Such a circuit is called a full adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/fa.png">
</p>


<p>
By stringing together a half-adder and a full adder, we can finally get a
circuit that can add two-bit numbers:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/2-bit-addr.gif">
</p>

<p>
In general, by stringing together several full adders one after another, we can
build blocks for adding numbers with more bits. Such blocks are called
ripple-carry adders.

<p>I’ve been in a reflective mood lately, probably because it’s the end of a very eventful year. Change is all around us and technology is the enabler.</p>



<p>On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own experiences with technology-driven change in the reinsurance industry, where I worked as an analyst from 2017 until recently.</p>



<p>During these three short years, I observed a radical shift in data analysis methodologies. Excel-based models, which had seemed top-of-the-line suddenly were too slow and too rigid; Integration with 3rd party data sources, which was once a luxury, became the norm; And analysts began to utilize scripts to accomplish many labor-intensive tasks typically performed by hand or in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Enabling this change is a suite of accessible Python-powered tools. These technologies are rapidly displacing the old way of doing things, ushering in a new wave of reinsurance models and the talent needed to support them.</p>



<p>Admittedly, the following observations do come from a very niche industry. But I believe that the broader trends discussed here will also apply to other legacy companies and sectors.</p>



<p>In this post, I explore the following topics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> – An introduction to reinsurance</li><li><strong>Section 2 – </strong>The need for technological disruption in the reinsurance industry</li><li><strong>Sections 3 to 5</strong> – How Python is replacing Excel</li><li><strong>Section 6 </strong>– Arguments against adopting new technologies</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> – The evolution of the reinsurance industry</li></ul>



<p>If you are curious about the transition from Excel to Python but aren’t interested in reinsurance, skip to section 3.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="406" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>1. Reinsurance, from an analyst’s perspective</h2>



<p>Most people understand insurance, but few have heard of its rather exotic sounding cousin: reinsurance. So, before I begin, here’s a quick intro:</p>



<p>Just as individuals transfer risk to insurers in exchange for a premium, insurers too must mitigate their risk by transferring some or all of their liabilities to one or more reinsurance companies. This enables insurers to protect themselves in the case of a large event, such as a hurricane, which affects many individual policyholders. Without reinsurers, insurance companies would not be able to survive catastrophes and would be much more risk averse, ultimately impacting the end consumer.</p>



<p>Reinsurance programs come in a variety of flavors to suit the need of the reinsured. I’ll spare you the details but suffice it to say that all potential reinsurance programs must first be analyzed. In industry speak, this is the process of “pricing a deal”.</p>



<p>For each deal, brokers gather relevant data from the insurance companies and send it to potential reinsurers as a “submission”. It is the underwriting analyst’s responsibility to parse this data, enter it into Excel-based models and produce a number.</p>



<p>This number, the loss ratio, represents the expected loss divided by the total premium and typically ranges between 10% to 150+%. LRs above 100% mean that the premium is not sufficient to cover the losses that we expect based on our model. In other words, we’d be writing the deal at a loss.</p>



<p>In reality, reinsurance companies have pricing hurdles well below 100% because they have other money outflows to account for such as brokerage (intermediary fees) and G&amp;A (general and administrative expenses).</p>



<p>The point is, Excel is the key piece of software that enables underwriting teams to assess new business. Throughout the company, different teams use different models, each with different processes and different pricing hurdles. But the one common theme is that all of the models are based on Excel spreadsheets. That’s just how the industry works. Everyone uses Excel for everything.</p>



<p>Well, until recently.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>2. Change is coming</h2>



<p>In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including:</p>



<ol><li>The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets</li><li>The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models</li><li>The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices</li></ol>



<p>Excel fails miserably at these tasks.</p>



<p>First, expressing complex reinsurance deals requires tabs and tabs of structural details, interlinking formulas and limiting assumptions. It’s a mess to build and a headache to understand. Have a lot of data? That’s more tabs and formulas to add to the model. Performance slows dramatically and minutes of your life are wasted waiting for bloated spreadsheets to finally open.</p>



<p>Second, you’re forced to use the VBA programming language if you want to query external data or implement user-defined functionality. According to one Stack Overflow survey, VBA ranked “most dreaded” of all the languages, which wholly sums up my feelings. The development environment is not user friendly, the syntax confusing, there’s no support for unit testing –&nbsp;I could go on.</p>



<p>Third, Excel is fragile. Views and logic are intermingled, making it very hard to troubleshoot errors. Also, models aren’t put into source control, so you can’t restore an old version. Massive spreadsheets with dozens of tabs frequently crash without warning, much to the dismay of underwriting analysts (like myself).</p>



<p>During my three years in reinsurance, I witnessed a dire need for new tooling. And, from what I observed, it is clear that this tooling will be powered by Python.</p>







<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>3. The future is Python</h2>



<p>As a technical underwriting analyst with programming skills, I was among the first to build and benefit from what I think are the next generation of pricing tools. These tools fall into two main categories:</p>



<ul><li>Excel models running Python code</li><li>Python notebooks in the browser</li></ul>



<p>Both options offer enhanced analysis capabilities while still catering to a non-technical or semi-technical end user.</p>



<p>Now, let’s explore each technology in more detail.</p>



<h2>4. Excel models running Python code</h2>



<p>The first category of new technology is based on augmentation. Rather than adding VBA code to your Excel spreadsheet, you can use Python instead. This is possible thanks to 3rd party Excel add-ins such <a href="https://www.pyxll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyXLL</a>, which brings the power of Python data analysis into the humble spreadsheet.</p>



<p>When you open Excel, the add-in makes your Python code accessible either as functions or as macros. This means that you can write Python code in the development environment of your choice, add unit tests, integrate with 3rd party libraries and push to source control.</p>



<p>PyXLL facilitated a step change in how we construct reinsurance models. Specifically, here’s how our setup looked before and after augmenting our model with Python:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Python</strong></td><td><strong>After Python</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We used an Excel spreadsheet-based model with dozens of tabs containing complex formulas, endless pivot tables and unintelligible VBA code.</td><td>The tangled mess of VBA was re-written into independent Python modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</td></tr><tr><td>The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open.</td><td>The Excel spreadsheet is now just a view, so it is lightweight and quick to open.</td></tr><tr><td>There was no visibility into errors. “Debugging” meant manually breaking apart lengthy Excel formulas.</td><td>The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently.</td></tr><tr><td>We were limited by the assumptions made when the model was first created, with little ability to add new features.</td><td>The codebase lives in source control, enabling multiple collaborators to work in tandem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developers can use their preferred development environment.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A robust peer review process helps to perpetuate high quality code.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Using PyXLL, we built an underwriting pricing model powered entirely by Python code. We were able to express structural complexities of deals at a level never before achieved. And we were able to add simulation-based pricing techniques that simply cannot be done using spreadsheets alone.</p>



<p>The impact of PyXLL on how we build models and ultimately price business cannot be understated.</p>



<p>Which leads us to the second technology that is changing the way we perform underwriting data analysis…</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>5. Python notebooks in the browser</h2>



<p>The second novel approach to reinsurance risk assessment and pricing is enabled via Python notebooks. These are web-based documents that can contain narrative text, live code, charts and visuals, plus results from your data analysis. </p>



<p>Python notebooks are all about collaboration, visualization and rapid iteration. They are a way to execute code with minimal setup and overhead, making it easier for new programmers to explore data outside of Excel. One of my favorite parts of notebooks is how easy it is to access your data, whether that’s from a file, SQL databases or an external source.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what a data analysis project looked like for me with and without Python notebooks:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Without Python Notebooks</strong></td><td><strong>With Python Notebooks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Manually query SQL databases and copy data into Excel. Keep data fresh by re-querying SQL and copying in new data.</td><td>Drop in a csv file, connect directly to an internal SQL database or utilize a 3rd party API to retrieve external data.</td></tr><tr><td>Perform analysis using Excel functions, pivot tables and VBA code. Functions quickly became unwieldy and difficult to troubleshoot.</td><td>Manipulate data easily and rapidly using Python libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborate with a colleague by closing Excel and letting your colleague know that the spreadsheet is available for them to work on.</td><td>Collaborate with colleagues by sharing the notebook.</td></tr><tr><td>Copy tabular results and charts into Word or Powerpoint and add written narrative as necessary.</td><td>Export results to csv or generate professional-looking PDFs to give directly to key stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Add explanatory narrative directly to the document alongside related code blocks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Create interactive charts and static visuals using libraries like <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plotly</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seaborn</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matplotlib</a>.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leverage existing libraries like <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SciPy</a> or <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scikit-learn</a> to …</td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Over the past decade or two, behavioural scientists have had a great ride. There have been bestselling books and Nobel Memorial Prizes. Every second government department and corporate has set up a team.</p>
<p>But recently, the wind seems to have changed. We’re told that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/behavioral-economics-latest-bias-seeing-bias-wherever-it-looks">behavioural economics is itself biased</a>.</p>

<p>I believe this challenge is deserved.</p>
<p>For too long we have been opining about people’s irrationality – that is, the irrationality of others – and that if only we designed the world more intelligently, people would make better decisions.</p>
<p>We often make these judgements based on narrow lab experiments that we generalise to the outside world. But as we well know, sometimes those experiments don’t replicate in that narrow lab environment. And even of those that replicate in the lab, many become an ineffective, or even dangerous tool when we try to apply them in the complex outside world.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story to illustrate.</p>
<h2>The hot hand fallacy</h2>
<p>This story comes from great <a href="https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA14943">work by&nbsp;Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo</a>. It stands as one of the starkest examples of where I have been forced to change my beliefs.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence from the lab that people have misperceptions about what randomness looks like. When a person is asked to generate a series that approximates the flipping of a coin, they will alternate between heads and tails too often, and balance the frequencies of heads and tails over too short a sequence. When people are asked to judge which of two different sequences of coin flips are more likely, they tend to pick sequences with more alternation, despite their probability being the same.</p>
<p>What happens we look for a failure to perceive randomness in the outside world? Out of the lab?</p>
<p>When people watch basketball, they often see a hot hand. They will describe players as “hot” and “in form”. Their belief is that the person who has just hit a shot or a series of shots is more likely to hit their next one.</p>
<p>But is this belief in the “hot hand” a rational belief? Or is the hot hand an illusion, whereby, just like they do with coins, they are seeing streaks in what is actually randomness?</p>
<p>In a famous examination of this question, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6">Thomas Gilovich,&nbsp;Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky</a> took shot data from a variety of sources, including the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics, and examined it for evidence of a hot hand.</p>
<p>What did they find? The hot hand was an illusion. As Daniel Kahneman wrote in <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> when describing this research:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The hot hand is entirely in the eye of the beholders, who are consistently too quick to perceive order and causality in randomness. The hot hand is a massive and widespread cognitive illusion.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Possibly even more interesting was the reaction to the findings from those in the sporting world. Despite the analysis, many sports figures denied that it could be true. Red Auerbach, who coached the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships, <a href="http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL15_SP_1991_Article_02.pdf">said</a> “Who is this guy? So he makes a study. I couldn’t care less.”</p>
<p>This provides another insight, about which Gilovich wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]he story of our research on the hot hand is only partly about the misperception of random events. It is also about how tenaciously people cling to their beliefs even in the face of hostile evidence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, this isn’t just about the misperception of the hot hand, but also about the failure of people to see their error when presented with evidence about it.</p>
<p>Let’s delve into how Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky showed the absence of a hot hand.</p>
<p>Imagine a person who took ten shots in a basketball game. A ball is a hit, an X is a miss.</p>
<p>What would count as evidence of a hot hand? What we can do is look at shots following a previous hit. For instance, in this sequence of shots there are 6 occasions where we have a shot following a previous hit. Five of those shots, such as the seventh here, are followed by another hit.</p>
<p>We can then compare their normal shooting percentage with the proportion of shots they hit if the shot immediately before was a hit. If their hit rate after a hit is higher than their normal shot probability, then we might say they get a hot hand.</p>
<p>This is effectively how Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky examined the hot hand in coming to their conclusion that it doesn’t exist. They also looked at whether there was a hit or miss after longer streaks of hits or misses, but this captures the basic methodology. It seems sensible.</p>
<p>But let me take a detour that involves flipping a coin.</p>
<p>Suppose you flip a coin three times. Here are the eight possible sequences of heads and tails. Each sequence has an equal probability of occurring. What if I asked you: if you were to flip a coin three times, and there is a heads followed by another flip in that sequence, what is the expected probability that another heads will follow that heads?</p>
<p>Here is the proportion of heads following a previous flip of heads for each sequence. In the first row of the table, the first flip is a head. That first flip is followed by another head. After the second flip, a head, we also have a head. There is no flip after the third head. 100% of the heads in that sequence followed by another flip are followed by a head.</p>
<p>In the second row of the table, 50% of the heads are followed by a head. In the last two rows, there are no heads followed by another flip.</p>
<p>Now, back to our question: if you were to flip a coin three times, and there is a heads followed by another flip in that sequence, what is the expected probability that another heads will follow that heads? It turns out it is 42%, which I can get by averaging those proportions.</p>
<p><strong>8 possible combinations of heads and tails across three flips</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Flips</strong></th>
<th><strong>p(H<sub>t+1</sub>|H<sub>t</sub>)</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>HHH</td>
<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HHT</td>
<td>50%</td>

<tr>
<td>HTH</td>
<td>0%</td>

<td>HTT</td>

<tr>
<td>TTH</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TTT</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Expected value</strong></td>
<td><strong>42%</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That doesn’t seem right. If we count across all the sequences, we see that there are 8 flips of heads that are followed by another flip. Of the subsequent flips, 4 are heads and 4 are tails, spot on the 50% you expect.</p>
<p>What is going on in that second column? By looking at these short sequences, we are introducing a bias. The cases of heads following heads tend to cluster together, such as in the first sequence which has two cases of a heads following a heads. Yet the sequence THT, which has only one shot occurring after a heads, is equally likely to occur. The reason a tails appears more likely to follow a heads is because of this bias whereby the streaks tend to cluster together. The expected value I get when taking a series of three flips is 42%, when in fact the actual probability of a heads following a heads is 50%. As the sequence of flips gets longer, the size of the bias is reduced, although it is increased if we examine longer streaks, such as the probability of a heads after three previous heads.</p>
<p>Why have I bothered with this counterintuitive story about coin flipping?</p>
<p>Because this bias is present in the methodology of the papers that purportedly demonstrated that there was no hot hand in basketball. Because of this bias, the proportion of hits following a hit or sequence of hits is biased downwards. Like our calculation using coins, the expected proportion of hits following a hit in a sequence is lower than the actual probability of hitting a shot.</p>
<p>Conversely the hot hand pushes the probability of hitting a shot after a previous hit up. Together, the downward bias and the hot hand roughly cancelled each other out, leading to the conclusion by researchers that each shot is independent of the last.</p>
<p>The result is, that when you correct for the bias, you can see that there actually is a hot hand in basketball.</p>
<p>When Miller and Sanjurjo crunched the numbers for one of the studies in the Gilovich and friends paper, they found that the probability of hitting a shot following a sequence of three previous hits is 13 percentage points higher than after a sequence of three misses. There truly is a hot hand. If Red Auerbach had coached as though there were no hot hand, what would his record have looked like?</p>
<p>I should say, this point does not debunk the earlier point about people misperceiving randomness. The lab evidence is strong. People tend to see the hot hand when people flip coins. It is possible that people overestimate the strength of the hot hand in the wild, although that is hard to show. But the hot hand exists.</p>
<p>Let’s turn back to one of the quotes I showed earlier.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]he story of our research on the hot hand is only partly about the misperception of random events. It is also about how tenaciously people cling to their beliefs even in the face of hostile evidence.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers expanded the original hot hand research from a story about people misperceiving randomness, to one of them continuing to do so even when presented with evidence that they were making an error.</p>
<p>But, as we can now see, their belief in the hot hand was not an error. The punters in the stands were right. Their accumulated experience had given them the answer. The researchers were wrong. Rather than the researchers asking whether they themselves were making an error when people refused to believe their research, they double downed and identified a second failure of human reasoning. The blunt dismissal of people’s beliefs led behavioural scientists to hold an untrue belief for over thirty years</p>
<p>This is a persistent characteristic of much applied behavioural science. It was an error I made many times when I first came to the discipline. We spend too little time questioning our  understanding of the decisions or observations other people make. If we believe they are in error, we should first question whether the error is ours.</p>
<h2>Priming</h2>
<p>Here’s another example. There is a body of behavioural science research known as priming, that suggests …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Matestack Ui Core Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>In this step-by-step guide, I will show you how to create a Twitter clone in pure Ruby with Matestack, following the great screencasts from Chris McCord <a href="https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI">Phoenix LiveView Twitter Clone</a> and Nate Hopkins <a href="https://youtu.be/F5hA79vKE_E">Stimulus Reflex Twitter Clone</a>. We will use the Gem <code>matestack-ui-core</code>, which enables us to implement our UI in some Ruby classes rather than writing ERB, HAML or Slim views. Furthermore we don't need to touch JavaScript in order to create reactive UI features, such as updating the DOM without a full browser page reload or syncing multiple web clients through Action Cable!</p>

<p>I've added a screencast (two parts) showing you what you will be doing in this tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mue5gs6Wtq4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Mue5gs6Wtq4/0.jpg" width="350"></a></p>

<p><em>This guide utilizes the full power of Matestack and uses <code>matestack-ui-core</code> as a complete substitute for Rails views. If you only want to create UI components in pure Ruby on existing Rails views, please check out <a href="https://docs.matestack.io/docs/ui_components/100-rails_integration">this guide</a></em></p>

have to reload the browser in order to see the new post! That's why we need to add the <code>async</code> component.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"> 

<p>browser-extension-reload is a server, userChrome scripts for Firefox and a Sublime Text plug-in it uses WebSocket.</p>

<p>When you load Firefox it will send the list of add-ons with their respective ids and paths to Sublime Text and as you make change to your files it will match the file path against the ones sent by the server.</p>

<p>You can have multiple directories watched for a single extension and you can load as many extensions as you want.</p>

<p>The tutorial is in three parts: server, userChrome (Firefox) and the Sublime Text plug-in.</p>

<p>Please read the carefully the README of each repository as you go.</p>



<ul>
  <li><code>git clone https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-server</code></li>
  <li><code>npm install</code></li>
  <li><code>npm start</code></li>
</ul>



<p>See <a href="https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-firefox/">https://github.com/thoughtsunificator/browser-extension-reload-firefox/</a></p>



<p>See <a href="https://gist.github.com/thoughtsunificator/12e18fb559e7f3e274574bcf4ce3dcb7">https://gist.github.com/thoughtsunificator/12e18fb559e7f3e274574bcf4ce3dcb7</a></p>



<p>You must run the server first then Firefox and finally Sublime Text.</p>

<p>It will not work if you do not respect this order.</p></article></div>]]>

December 30, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/useful-shell-prompt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/useful-shell-prompt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There are only a few apps I use every day and shell — ZSH — is one of the most used. It’s been that way since the beginning of the ’00s and back then I spent a lot of time configuring my prompt to be a good balance between compact/readable and useful. I found that I dislike fancy two-line prompts, information on a right-hand side (because of its awkward behavior), and stuff like that. So the result looks like that:</p>
<pre><code>piranha@rigel ~&gt; █
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>█</code> is a cursor. It shows username, <code>@</code> to separate it from hostname - or <span><code>#</code></span> if this is uid 0 shell, then hostname, and a home-abbreviated path. One of the fancy things is that space before the cursor is Unicode glyph <code>\u00A0</code> - non-breaking space - which is bound in ZLE to delete everything to the beginning of a line. Unfortunately, this does not work with Terminal.app, so it just sits there waiting for a better time. This setup along with colors had no changes for over a decade.</p>
<p>But a week ago a saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid/status/1316081732467081217">tweet</a> with an idea to change prompt’s prompt (the <code>&gt;</code> thingie) to a red color when previous command exited with an error status. This motivated me to cleanup and update my prompt to a newer conventions. This is a result:</p>
<p><img alt="prompt screenshot" src="https://solovyov.net/media/prompt.jpg" height="60px" width="127px"></p>
<p>You can see I removed my username since it really gives me no information, no reason to spend space on that. I also really like white background, but if you don’t, changing colors is easy — I’ll explain how everything works.</p>
<p>Let’s break down it bit by bit. The prompt syntax is a little hard on the eyes - in case if you have ideas on how to write this so next time I won’t have to dig deep into ZSH documentation, I’ll be glad to listen.</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, few things are interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%(x.if-true.if-false)</code> construct (documented <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Conditional-Substrings-in-Prompts">here</a>) shows either <code>@</code> if I’m a normal user or a red <span><code>#</code></span> if I’m a root.</li>
<li><code>!</code> there means “True if the shell is running with privileges”.</li>
<li>You can clearly see <code>@</code> after the second dot, but what does <code>%F{red}%B#%b%f</code> mean? <code>%B</code> means “start bold”, <code>%b</code> means “end bold”.</li>
<li><code>%F</code>/<code>%f</code> duo is “start/stop color” - it can either accept old-style color numbers (where 1 is red) or color names, which is easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
</code></pre>
<p>Those are easy to understand, just refer to <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html">documentation</a> — <code>%m</code> is a hostname before the first dot, <code>%~</code> is a path where <code>$HOME</code> is abbreviated to <code>~</code>.</p>
<pre><code>p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'
</code></pre>
<p>This is a new part. <code>?</code> means “True if exit status of the last command was 0”. So if a command exited nicely (with a status code 0), then it’s going to be blue <span><code>&gt;</code></span>, in other case it’s going to be red <span><code>&gt;</code></span>. Voila! :-)</p>
<p>End result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>p_at='%(!.%F{red}%B#%b%f.@)'
p_host='%F{blue}%m%f'
p_path='%F{blue}%~%f'
p_pr='%(?.%F{blue}.%F{red})&gt;%f'

PS1="$p_at$p_host $p_path$p_pr "
unset p_at p_host p_path p_pr
</code></pre>
<p>You can see I’m unsetting color in every variable and unset those variables — cleaning up after yourself is a valuable habit, especially with a shell. :-)</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the same could be done for bash (or tclsh, or whatever), but I’m not using it so… If anybody wants to contribute a similar configuration for other shells, I’ll gladly link to a post or add it here.</p>

<p>Many people are looking for a habit tracker bullet journal guide or example. In this post, I’m going to show you how I take the spirit of the bullet journal concept and apply it to Roam Research.</p>



<p>There are many things that can be tracked, but for my example I’m going to show you what I track and how I track it. I’ll also give you the exact “code” I use so you can set this up yourself to create your own habit tracker bullet journal for Roam.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll make it a habit to<a aria-label=" take good notes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mikegiannulis.com/how-to-take-good-notes-part1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> take good notes</a>, which I think could be a life-changing habit to add to your life.</p>

<p>Famed management guru Peter Drucker said it best.</p>



<blockquote><p>What gets measured, gets managed.</p><cite>Peter Drucker</cite></blockquote>



<p>So, if you want to create lasting change in your life, you need to start tracking your habits and becoming “aware”. The truth is you already are relying on habits to run your life. It’s the nature of being human that we rely on habits to reduce our cognitive load.</p>



<p>By becoming conscious of our habits, we can track them and over time get rid of old habits and create new habits. But the key is that we must be aware and we must track. Otherwise, we will slide back into our “old ways” and the change we seek will stop.</p>



<h3><span id="What_Should_I_Track_With_My_Habit_Tracker_Bullet_Journal">What Should I Track With My Habit Tracker Bullet Journal?</span></h3>



<p>There are so many things that you can track, the list is really up to you. However, in general, there are a few areas that most of us should be tracking. I’m going to list out for you now what I am presently tracking.</p>



<p><strong>List Of Habits To Track:</strong></p>

<p>Now if you are using a habit tracker bullet journal, this video shows how you to do that:</p>

<p>Now, if you are using Roam Research yet then you need to go sign up. It’s relatively inexpensive and it can absolutely change your life. It’s a sort of note taking tool that really has changed my entire life.</p>

<p>And I also want to say that I didn’t create this idea of Habit Tracking in Roam. I watched a lot of Youtube Videos about this and the ones that were most helpful were <a aria-label="Anonym.s  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2Dh3N7QpuZP6LLhUMkMqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonym.s </a>and <a aria-label="Shu Omi.

<h3><span id="Video_Walkthrough_Of_Setting_Up_Habit_Tracking_In_Roam_Research">Video Walkthrough Of Setting Up Habit Tracking In Roam Research</span></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="How To Track Habits Using Roam Research [[Walkthrough]]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6VWMFZqA3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Here’s a video walkthrough if you prefer learning that way.</figcaption></figure><p>What you want to do is to create a table inside of Roam. You can create a table by typing /table and pressing enter.</p>



<p>You will then see something that looks like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="490" height="253" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table.png 490w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default-table-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"></figure><p>Underneath the table, you will then want to create the things you want to track. For my sample, I will use my Supplements tracking.</p>



<p>Make sure you tab over one to the right so that you are indented underneath the table (The blank bullet in my screenshot). Press tab to indent.</p>



<p>Start by giving a name to what you will be tracking. In my case, I will type “Supplements”. You should now see this is the top left name of the table. </p>



<p>Now, press enter and tab over one and type out Monday. Press enter, tab again, and type Tuesday. Do this until you have completed the days of the week. Note that you can start on any day of the week you want or you could do this weekly if you wanted like Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, etc.</p>



<p>When done it should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="354" height="234" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week.png 354w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-of-week-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></figure><p>If you look at your Table now, you will have 8 column titles… starting with Supplements and running all the way through Sunday.</p>



<p>Now that we have the columns, we need to start putting in the rows. To do that, press enter again and use “shift + tab” until your bullet is now even again with “Supplements”. Then type the first thing you want to track. You should keep these all on the same indentation just pressing enter after each one.</p>



<p>In my case I would type:</p>



<p>Testosterone (enter)<br>DECA (enter)<br>HCG (enter)<br>AI Blocker (enter)<br>Vitamin D (enter)<br>In Perium (enter)<br>Collagen (enter)<br>Fortagen (enter)</p>



<p>At this point you’ll see that you have rows and colums and it should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="825" height="332" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table.png 825w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table-300x121.png 300w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-table-768x309.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px"></figure><p>If you have any extra rows showing up at this point that’s ok. It should fix itself when we do the final step here which is to add a checkbox so we can mark a field as “complete”. </p>



<p>To do this, we want to go back to the  different things we want to track. Let’s start with Testosterone again. Click on the Testosterone line and press enter. Now tab one over. If you had any weird formatting issues, they should be gone now.</p>



<p>What we want do to now is add a checkmark that can be toggled On/Off. Thankfully, this feature is built into Roam Research.</p>



<p>So go ahead and type /todo and this will create a checkbox for you. If you are feeling fancy you can also type the code in directly which is {{[[TODO]]}} or you can hit CMD Enter or CRTL Enter and this will also insert the TO DO box.</p>



<p>Press enter and tab over again. Insert the TODO code. Do this again and again (enter and tab) and you should see the checkboxes being added underneath the day of the week. </p>



<p>It should look like this when done:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="313" height="232" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes.png 313w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/todoboxes-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px"></figure><p>And your Table should look like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="820" height="78" src="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo.png 820w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo-300x29.png 300w, https://mikegiannulis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/table-todo-768x73.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></figure><p>To finish off the table, you will just repeat the same step again underneath each of the things you are tracking.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you, you can “cheat” and use this code below. Although, I recommend doing it yourself a few times so you know how to better tweak it later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p>
<p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p>
<p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p>
<p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p>
<p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p>
<p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p>
<p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p>
<p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when youâ€™re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p>
<p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote>
<p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p>
<p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p>
<p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p>
<p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p>
<p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Promotional text:

Over the holidays, spent some time reflecting on the past 7 years of Sourcegraph and the state of developer tools in general. Very excited to see what the future holds (and to bring the future sooner with our work). It's time to buildâ€”developer tools: https://beyang.org/time-to-build-dev-tools.html

-->
<h2><span>It's time to build developer tools</span><span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2020.12.29</span></h2>
<p>We are living through a golden age in developer tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+is+eating+the+world">Software is eating the world</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=every+company+is+a+software+company">Every company is now a software company</a>.</p>
<p>Every software company needs developers—and developer tools.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of companies building tools for developers is booming. If you are a developer who loves the art and craft of programming, if you like working on <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/optimizing-a-code-intel-indexer/">technical problems beyond scaling CRUD</a>, or if you love the idea of accelerating technological progress by building tools for people like yourself, you should think about working on dev tools!</p>
<h2>Historic forces, immense opportunity</h2>
<p>Every company that now writes code has discovered (or is discovering) that software development is really tricky. The world needs more software, but it’s not as simple as hiring more developers. Building software doesn’t scale or parallelize easily. Serial dependencies coupled with unforeseen complexity lead to gross underestimates of timeline and budget, which in turn lead to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them">bad</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-so-many-high-profile-digital-transformations-fail">business</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/heres-why-ge-fords-digital-transformation-programs-failed-last-year.html">outcomes</a> and even <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/08/19/10-great-companies-that-lost-their-edge">existential</a> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp">crises</a>.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of developing software quickly and efficiently at scale, more and more companies are building and buying developer tools. It’s no longer just the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts, and Amazons of the world spending serious money doing so.</p>
<p>To satisfy this increasingly apparent need, a rapidly growing new industry of developer tool companies has arisen in recent years. Individual names like GitHub, GitLab, and HashiCorp are now well known and the emergence of the field has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/16/developer-tools-quietly-become-a-growth-story/">not</a> <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/rise-of-the-developer">gone</a> <a href="https://alven.co/the-debrief-go-to-market-in-dev-tools-part-1/">unnoticed</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate how quickly the market for developer tools has grown in the past decade.
When Quinn and I started Sourcegraph back in 2013, we quickly discovered that “dev tool” was a dirty word among investors. Developer tools, it was thought, were super valuable, but most of them were single player tools that didn’t make enough money (e.g., JetBrains, Sublime Text), internal tools built for the specific needs of a particular big tech company (e.g., Google Code Search), or open-source projects that no one paid for and which you could only make money from by selling services and support. Investors told us there was just one billion-dollar company that sold to developers—Red Hat—and it was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>Developers were building lots of valuable software that was sold to other folks—salespeople, marketers, designers, etc.—but when it came to their own work, the common refrain was, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes">“the cobbler’s children have no shoes”</a>. An article in TechCrunch lamented, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/22/will-developer-tools-startups-ever-find-investors/">“Will Developer Tools Startups Ever Find Investors?"</a></p>
<p>But then, somewhere along the line of the past seven years, something changed. Evidence of this shift is in the valuations: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">GitHub acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/-gitlab-valued-over-6-billion-in-secondary-share-sale.html">GitLab valued at $6 billion</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/hashicorp-soars-above-5b-valuation-in-new-175m-venture-round/">HashiCorp at $5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/czech-startup-founders-turn-billionaires-without-vc-help">JetBrains estimated at $7 billion</a>, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But though the big numbers with lots of zeroes raise eyebrows and make the headlines, they are just the byproduct of the underlying factors driving big changes in where and how software is built. To list a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Competition from Big Tech and tech-enabled startups moving into every industry is driving every company to prioritize software as a core competency.</li>
<li><strong>Big Code:</strong> The amount of code in the world has been growing rapidly, and more and more companies have reached a tipping point previously reached only by the largest tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise OSS:</strong> The maturation of “the cloud” as a software platform built on top of open-source software (Linux and Kubernetes), in contrast to older software platforms, which were vertically integrated proprietary ecosystems (e.g., Windows + .NET + Visual Studio).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other trends at play here, but one thing is certain: almost every valuable or growing company is now building software and most have realized they need great developer tools to compete.</p>
<p>This is fantastic news. “Tech” has traditionally been a distinct sector of the economy, and the ability to build software effectively at scale was confined to a handful of big technology companies. Now, companies in every sector understand that code has to become a core part of their DNA. And this means the impact of code and software is amplified. No longer does the value proposition of software have to flow through some product or service offered by a “tech company”—companies across every sector of the economy are now learning how to build great software themselves.</p>
<p>As the broader economy learns to build software, progress will accelerate. All the promises that the future holds—<a href="https://grail.com/">cures for cancer</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">life-saving</a> <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/">medicine</a>, <a href="http://uber.com/">mass</a> <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">individualized</a> <a href="https://comma.ai/">transportation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-rockets-fly-with-software-you-can-find-on-your-android-phone/">rocketships</a>, and more—will arrive sooner in large part thanks to code. Software has long been recognized as a technological accelerant. But developer tools are now a <em>second-order accelerant</em> on technological progress. This is an immense opportunity.</p>
<p>How best to pursue it?</p>
<h2>Large companies, open source, and startups</h2>
<p>There are three places where you can work on developer tools. (There may be more, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on these.)</p>
<p>The first is inside a large non-developer-tool company. Many large companies that build software are investing heavily in internal tools. There have been a lot of great dev tools created inside large companies, and many such tools have inspired the creation of similar tools outside the company. Blaze, the build system of Google, inspired other build systems like Pants and Facebook’s Buck and was later itself open-sourced as Bazel. Large companies also offer the benefit of a large, stable salary. The downside is that the direct impact of your work will likely be limited to a single organization. It’s possible that your work will be open-sourced down the road, but there is no guarantee, and it can often take years to get the necessary legal and bureaucratic approvals to do so. And, of course, you don’t have a direct piece of the financial upside if the tool becomes super widely used.</p>
<p>The second place you can build dev tools is on an open-source project. Working in the open guarantees you will receive recognition for your work, and you also have the benefit of not having any pesky pricing considerations standing in between your users and your product. If mass adoption is your primary goal, then open source holds great appeal. Many of the most widely used developer tools—Git, Linux, Emacs, Vim, etc.—are open source projects. The downside, of course, is lack of revenue. Most open-source authors and maintainers have an alternate source of income (often working at a large tech company). Patreon and GitHub Sponsors are great, but it’s likely that only a small fraction of open-source creators will ever earn enough to make a comfortable living through sponsorship alone. The number of hours you can devote to working on open source will be constrained by where you can find sources of income.</p>
<p>The third place is at a developer tools company. Most such companies will be startups, because of the rapid growth in market size for dev tools over the past few years. Dev tools companies offer the benefit of aligned incentives: your users, your customers, and even your fellow engineering teammates are often the same people. If you build a great tool, then your users are happy, you get paid so you are also happy, and you and your teammates can also make use of the same tool, so that should make you doubly happy! Dev tool startups have the additional benefit of financial upside (assuming part of your compensation is an equity stake in the business). This upside could be substantial. Personally, I think we are in the early days of the developer tools market. I believe the impact of high-quality, broadly useful dev tools will someday far exceed the impact of <a href="https://www.google.com/">ads-driven web search</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">PC operating systems</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/">social media</a>. Which is to say, I think that the value of developer tool companies will someday exceed the combined value of the most valuable tech companies today.</p>
<p>Of course, startups also carry a downside risk. There is a high chance that the company will fail to meet its lofty goals, or may need to lay people off, or fail completely. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the best place to work. Personally, the principle I follow is, “Maximize expected utility subject to minimizing the risk of ruin,” where the definition of “utility” and “ruin” is up to you to define.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you opt for large companies, open source, or dev tool startups, there is still the question of how to evaluate which specific opportunities and tools are worthy of your time. For that, you’ll need to rely on a combination of intuition and worldview, which we’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2>Scratch your own itch, but understand the big picture</h2>
<p>Jamie Zawinski once said, “The best motivator in the world is scratching your own itch.” He was talking about developer tools, and he was right. Most developer tools start with a programmer noticing they have a problem, imagining a way to fix the problem through software automation, and then writing the code that implements that automation. Building for yourself means you get to wear the hat of product manager, engineer, and customer simultaneously. This is a fantastic recipe for building something truly useful, not just for yourself, but for other people who feel the same pain. As you evaluate the landscape of enterprise developer tools, you should rely heavily on your own intuition for where pain points exist and which products offer effective solutions.</p>
<p>However, you’ll also want to combine your direct intuition with a broader view of how software development works—what is common across companies and sectors and what is different and specific to the segment of the market you are building for. It’s important to understand where your itch fits into the overall picture, how others experience that itch, and how <em>their</em> itch fits into <em>their</em> picture.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Making things look nice can take a long time, either due to lack of resources or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">abundance of opinions</a>. This could delay launches, frustrate people, and waste precious energy. Those are high costs for startups or companies hoping to move fast.</p>

<p>Is it worth it?</p>

<p>Long ago I got fed up with delaying marketing campaigns because an email had to look nice. I tested styled versus unstyled emails and found that <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">making emails look nice was <em>not</em> worth it</a>.</p>

<p>After years of repeating some form of that test, and generally noticing that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">simplistic</a> <a href="https://www.ncino.com/">and</a> <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">rough-around-the-edges</a> <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">designs</a> <a href="https://www.duckcreek.com/">don’t</a> <a href="https://jfrog.com/">seem</a> <a href="https://unity.com/">to</a> <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/">affect</a> <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">outcomes</a> <a href="https://www.changehealthcare.com/">of</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/">enterprise</a> <a href="https://tintri.com/">software</a> <a href="https://www.avalara.com/">companies</a>, I developed a bias towards <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">simplicity</a> and shipping things before they look nice.</p>

<p>From time to time I like to test my assumptions. Maybe looking nice matters more now than before, or maybe the effects I saw only applied to email, or maybe I’m just looking for reasons to do <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/">less work</a>?</p>

<p>For the latest experiment I ran two ads on LinkedIn, targeting executives at enterprise software companies, to see which of them got more clicks. One ad looked nice (or nice enough), like something a marketing team would spend a couple of hours to discuss and produce. The other ad looked like, well…</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b38efe41c13f8c6ce04f4b37ce9cc1190d842109/13687/images/uploads/ad-test.png" alt="A/B test of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p>One is a beautiful work of art, the other is Option A and took $148 plus a few days of waiting.</p>

<p>Let’s see how they performed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80dc44df97f02f04bbe43976e9b36fedfb201656/0f78f/images/uploads/ad-test-results.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bb49bdb516c4ad0f99fa5fc3909b4f5caf8d5253/1dd14/images/uploads/ad-test-results-2.png" alt="A/B test results of pretty vs ugly ad"></p>

<p><strong>An ad that took me 15 seconds to create had a 2.5x better clickthrough rate than one done by a paid designer.</strong> If this were an actual campaign it would mean 2.5x more sales leads or user signups at a lower acquisition cost, on top of shipping faster with less overhead.</p>

<p>From time to time we need a reminder about what’s worth the effort, and what isn’t.</p>

        <p>This post is for everyone who is trying to start a company right now. </p><p>The headlines make it seem easy. </p><p>20 year old kids raising millions of dollars to build the next Snapchat. Smug digital nomads posted up on a beach in Thailand making $75k/month. That lifestyle design dude who made $200k selling a Twitter course this year. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's fucking hard. </strong></p><p>At least it was for me. </p><p>I wanted to be a millionaire by 30. I was broke at 25. </p><p>I launched dozens of products, navigated through the minefield, and came out of it with business that exceeded all my expectations - millions in annual recurring revenue. </p><p>Here's the true story. </p><h2 id="year-0-inspiration-">Year 0 (inspiration)</h2><p>About 10 years ago I unofficially graduated university. </p><p>I had the credits to finish early, but stuck around to take one last class. That class </p><p>New Venture Design - it paired up business and engineering students to build a company. </p><p>That class changed my life.</p><p>My accounting major put me in the "useless business guy" category, so I consciously recruited the only two software engineers in the class. </p><p>The project we dreamed up was a daylighting system for commercial office buildings we called Luminex. </p><p>Essentially, reflective venetian blinds that tracked the sun and automatically reflected light into the ceiling - so you can work at your computer with natural light and no glare. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-5.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png 625w"><figcaption>Rendering of the project</figcaption></figure><p>Still one of my best ideas. </p><p>Instead of testing it in the market, the primary objective of that class was to compete in business plan competitions. Which just means pitching to students and professors. It had nothing to do with building a successful business. </p><p>We won three competitions - &nbsp;taking home $15,000 in prize money. </p><p>It was a great way to cap off my university career. </p><p>We graduated in May 2011, and decided to pursue the idea full-time. </p><h2 id="year-1-optimism-">Year 1 (optimism)</h2><p>One school never paid out their $5000 prize (thanks for nothing, UNBC!). </p><p>So with $10,000 in winnings to our name, we were ready to take on the world. </p><p>Along with our business plan competition spoils, I personally had $8,000 saved. </p><p><strong>I never considered getting a real job. </strong></p><p>I didn't jive with the dogma business school pushed on its impressionable young students. Recruiting events with a bunch of 20 year olds putting on suits to impress 23 year olds in suits for the privilege of making $40k/year working 80 hours a week. &nbsp;The weird reverence for McKinsey and KPMG. </p><p>I had some experience making my own money - running a window cleaning company that grossed $45k one summer - and once you've charged your friends out for $30/hr and paid them $15, it's hard to imagine working for anyone else. </p><p>The three of us were ready to build a hardware company. With $10,000. </p><p>A month after jumping into the abyss, we quickly realized we had no idea what we were doing and no money to do it with. The extent of our market validation was a few random people telling us our idea was good, and a prototype with some really decent software on it. </p><p>It took 3 months to realize it was never going to work. One engineer quit. </p><p>We were down to a partnership with no plan, no direction, no strategy, and no money. Yet, I still had a weird optimism that I'd figure it out. </p><p>I made $7,000 this year. </p><h2 id="year-2-survival-">Year 2 &nbsp;(survival)</h2><p>At the time, I was living in an amazing downtown apartment with two friends. </p><p>We squeezed 3 of us into a 2 bedroom + den apartment, on a grandfathered $2200/mo lease. My share was $800. </p><p>My friends all had real jobs at this point, but it never crossed my mind to get one. </p><p>I didn't want to move back home. I didn't want to get a job. I didn't even know what a job looked like (still don't!). </p><p>My only goals were to make that rent payment, drink a few beers, try to meet women, and eat. My business partner and I turned to what we knew. </p><p>Craigslist. </p><p>More specifically, web development on Craigslist. </p><p>We started building average Wordpress websites for small businesses, averaging $1000 to $4000 per month in sales from posting ads on Craigslist. </p><p>To supplement that kinglike income, we also started blogging on Seeking Alpha - writing stock investment advice for $80-$300 per article. </p><figure><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/296864-apples-future-is-in-the-icloud"><div><p>Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing</p><p><img src="https://seekingalpha.com/samw/static/images/favicon-192x192.png"><span>SeekingAlpha</span></p></div><p><img src="https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png"></p></a></figure><p>I had never bought a stock, and here I was - writing about Apple's future. </p><p>I should have bought Apple stock. </p><p>We shipped dozens of projects. </p><p>A website that paired up students and businesses, an events listing website, a Wordpress theme directory, a platform that helped companies pre-test job applicants skills, and many other forgotten ones. </p><p>The worst one was probably office composting. </p><p>Urban Dirt picked up your organic waste (in a rented Zipcar, as I didn't own a vehicle), and dropped it off at a composting facility for $30/week. </p><p>We got 10 customers for that business, and nearly landed the contract for Rogers Arena (Home of the Canucks) through a cold call. Hundreds of dollars of revenue wasn't enough, so we decided to make a huge bet on making our own fertilizer out of used coffee grounds from Starbucks. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This image gives me shivers.</figcaption></figure><p>We spent weeks drying coffee grounds on homemade racks and packaging it in paper bags to sell at farmers markets. We sold $40 worth. </p><p>I rented my room out on AirBnB on the weekends and slept on my couch to make ends meet. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. </p><p>I made $30,000 in 2012. </p><h2 id="year-3-momentum-">Year 3 (momentum)</h2><p>To summarize - two years into my entrepreneurship journey I was somewhat scraping by building crappy websites for random businesses, blogging about stocks that I wasn't invested in, and slanging fertilizer. </p><p>Broke. </p><p>Depressed. </p><p>Yet, not ready to quit. </p><p>I don't remember the genesis, but one project we ended up building was an applicant tracking system. I'm sure I've told the story about how we wanted to hire for our web design agency and needed a way to track applicants so we built this software to solve our own problem. </p><p>That's a lie - our agency never hired anyone. We probably built that software because I saw it somewhere and it looked like something we could build. </p><p>Anyways, we built an applicant tracking system (it worked!) and I hustled my ass off to sign up customers. </p><p>A few companies (thanks Charlyne, Heidi, and Gord) believed in us enough to pay us a little bit of money for it. From there, we had a few more ideas around the recruitment space - again, likely borrowed. One idea was a really cool tool that helped asynchronously test out job applicants skills before they got hired. </p><p>Similar to Codility, but for everyone. </p><p>We couldn't get customers. People just wanted an applicant tracking system. </p><p>We tried to make that applicant tracking system sexier, by allowing companies to add pictures/videos of their companies to their job postings. Like Unbounce for your job postings. No one wanted it. </p><p>We got desperate. </p><p>To promote our product, we decided to host an online job fair. We dreamed up the idea for an online event where candidates could visit company "booths," chat with recruiters, and drop their resume. </p><p>We set a 6 week deadline to launch and promote it. </p><p>I hit the phones hard, and signed up 40 companies. My cofounder built the software. We got press in some of the countries' <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/bc-tech-fair-delivers-online-job-fair">biggest publications</a>. Thousands of candidates pre-registered for the event. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>We went live on 2pm on Monday, July 23rd. </p><p>Our servers crashed. </p><p>I punched a wall. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattfromlater">Matt</a> (who we were sharing an office space with) got our servers back up, and the site held together for a few hours. Overall it was a very average experience, but enough to get us on the radar of Growlab - Vancouver's version of YCombinator. </p><p>Growlab was a group of experienced entrepreneurs and mentors who invested $20,000 in startups with the goal of helping them raise more money. That online job fair got us on their radar, and we got into the program. </p><p>One minor issue - we had no idea what the fuck we were doing. </p><p>At this point we had 4 products in the market with a handful of users. </p><p>An applicant tracking system (~1k MRR) </p><p>Asyncronous skills testing (alpha product)</p><p>Unbounce for job postings (~50 users)</p><p>An online job fair platform (1 event) </p><p>We had no vision, and no direction. </p><p>Growlab invested $20,000. This was the most money I'd seen in a bank account in 3 years. If we met minimum criteria, the Business Development Bank of Canada would invest another $150,000 into the company after 3 months. &nbsp;</p><p>We decided to focus on KarmaHire - Unbounce for job postings. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1039w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It hurts my brain to think about trying to get that thing off the ground back then. </p><p>I tried everything. </p><p>Automatically creating job postings for companies on Indeed, and then sending them the postings. Cold calling from 7am to 8pm (on the damn PHONE). </p><p>I was under the gun, and nothing was working. </p><p>My stress levels were through the roof. I was telling a story every week to our investors that had a hint of truth to it, and failing to make that reality come true. </p><p>Unnamed mentor gave me some of the worst fucking advice I've gotten. </p><blockquote>"Never let the truth get in the way of a good story."</blockquote><p>I've always had a guilty conscience, and while by the letter of the law I was telling the truth - it hurt my soul to extrapolate tiny data points into a broad narrative. </p><p>My stress levels peaked one Wednesday in May. </p><p>I got to the office at 7am, ready to start cold-calling. I reached into my backpack and realized I forgot my laptop at home. </p><p>I cracked. </p><p>I stumbled out of the office in a daze, walking home with no regard for red lights or traffic laws. I nearly got hit by a car. Twice. </p><p>I was completely checked out. The only thing that brought me back to sanity was the fact that my Grandma picked up the phone when I called her. We talked about nothing of substance, but she told me she loved me. </p><p>I made it home and slept for 6 hours. And went back to work the next day. </p><p>We survived Growlab, and impressed the BDC enough to raise that $150,000. </p><p>It may have been the haircut more than the product. </p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgqK0Bi5lME?start=21&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>The techiest of tech bros.</figcaption></figure><p>A lifeline, and a hint of validation. </p><p>Despite its challenges, Growlab accelerated my learning 10x.

      <h4>Leon Wieseltier</h4>
      <h3>Steadying</h3>
      <p>For some time now it has felt like history is itself the pandemic. In our country and elsewhere, it has been in overdrive, teeming with evils, flush with collapses, abounding in fear and rage, a wounding contest between the sense of an ending and the sense of a beginning, between inertia and momentum, with all the terribilities of ages of transition. What is going has not yet gone and what is coming has not yet come. We have become connoisseurs of convulsion. At sea is our new sea.</p>
<p>For better and for worse, axioms and assumptions are dying everywhere around us. Such vertiginous hours always come with both clarities and confusions — there is no promise of illumination. The guidance we need in our circumstances will not be provided by the circumstances themselves: they are too many and too contradictory and too volatile; passion increasingly unconstrained and power increasingly unconstrained. As the sense of injustice grows, injustice seems to keep pace with it. There is a piercing sensation of flux, of uncontrollable effects and unmanageable consequences. The masks on our faces are emblems of an entire era of vulnerability. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep our heads. A disequilibrium of history demands an equilibrium of the mind. Steadiness in the midst of turbulence is not complicity with the existing order. It is precisely in such binges of history that we must teach ourselves to sort through the true and the false, the good and the bad, the continuities and the discontinuities, the right statues and the wrong statues, the humane and the utopian.</p>
<p>Everything will be different: this is a ubiquitous sentiment. In all our upheavals — social and epidemiological — so much seems to be wrong and so much seems to be slipping away that one may be forgiven for enjoying a fantasy of total change. All these horrors, all these outrages, all these marches, and the world stays the same? So the first thing that needs to be said in the effort to keep our heads is that everything never changes. More, the idea that everything will change usually plays into the hands of those who want nothing to change. The cycle of revolution and reaction has never been the most effective engine of progress. Nothing suits the interests of the old regime like utopianism. The thirst for change will not be slaked by the cheap whiskey of apocalyptic thinking. The only certain outcome of the apocalyptic temper is catharsis, and one way of describing the decline of our politics in recent decades is that it has increasingly become a politics of catharsis, in which crisis is met mainly by emotion. (Populism is just mass emotionalism, and the emotions are often ugly ones.) Apocalypse is not an analysis, it is the death of analysis. It sets the stage only for salvation, but salvation must never become a political goal. This is especially true in a democratic society, where the only saviors are, alas, ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the struggle against injustice imposes upon us a paradoxical psychology: it demands both impatience and patience. Impatience about injustice, patience about justice. This is hard to do. It looks too much like, and in many cases it may well be, complacence. It is certainly difficult to preach incrementalism to the injured. So why not be impatient about justice, too? There are historical and practical reasons why not. History is stained by tales of instantaneous justice, by the consequences of the rush to perfection, by the victims of the victims. The ethical calculus of means and ends is never teleologically suspended, if just causes are to remain just. Nor is it a quantitative calculus: when I first studied the modern history of the Jews I drew a variety of conclusions from the Dreyfus affair, and one of them, which was an important moment in my moral education, was that Zola and his comrades appropriately threw an entire country into crisis for the sake of <i>one man</i>. Similarly, due process is not a legal formality, a procedural exercise that slows the way to a satisfying climax; it is the very honor of a liberal society.</p>
<p>More concretely, the establishment of justice involves not only revisions in opinions but also revisions in institutions. A dreary point! But anyone who denies the institutional dimension, in all its exasperating machinery, is not serious about the change. Paroxysms, unlike laws, vanish. This was the year in which the campaign for racial justice found support in virtually all the sectors of American society, with the exception of the White House — an unprecedented national epiphany that cannot be dismissed as “performative”, because culture matters; but the road from protest to policy is long and winding. It is not a betrayal of the ideal of social justice to tread carefully and tenaciously, with a mastery of the scruples and the methods that would make a reform defensible and durable. Tenacity is what patience looks like in the middle of a struggle.</p>
<p>I will give an example of the complicated nature of the mentality of change. One of the consequences of recent social movements in America — #MeToo (which came also to my door, with its lesson and its recklessness) and Black Lives Matter—has been to reveal how poorly we understand each other. Or more precisely, they have exposed the extent to which the failure to understand others may be owed to the failure to understand oneself — the limitations of one’s own standpoint, the comfortable assumption that one appears to others as one wishes to appear to them, or to oneself. This is nonsense, though sometimes you learn so the hard way. There are limits to our epistemological jurisdiction. The failure to observe these limits is solipsism, and we all begin as solipsists, awaiting correction by social experience.</p>
<p>Our epistemological jurisdiction stops at the encounter with another person. She is another epistemological kingdom, not more perfect but certainly different, with something important to add, and a perceptual contribution to make. I may like to think that I am what I present myself to be, but I am also what she sees me to be, because she sees me as I cannot, or will not, see myself. I am never in control of my self-representation and never complete in my self-awareness. We always show more of ourselves than we think we do, which is why we may learn from the responses of others. We spill beyond our intentions and our conceits, and what we gain from this overflow is criticism.</p>
<p>But criticism, too, must be assessed critically – there is no exemption. The enlightenment that one acquires from the judgments of others is owed only to their accuracy. It is certainly not warranted by the belief that a person’s identity or socio-economic position or experience of hardship confers an absolute authority, a special relationship to truth, a vatic privilege. What a simple world it would be if pain were a sufficient guarantee of credibility. But it is not – indeed, the opposite is the case, pain is myopic and sees chiefly itself, which is one of the reasons it hurts. Finally we are all left with the modesty of our grasp. No whole classes of people are right and no whole classes of people are wrong.</p>
<p>The ineradicability of ambiguity from human relations, the ignorance of ourselves that accompanies our ignorance of others, the whole fallible heap, creates an urgent need for tolerance and, more strenuously, for forgiveness. Historians will record that in the early decades of the twenty-first century we became an unforgiving society, a society of furies, a society in search of guilt and shame, a society of sanctimonies and “struggle sessions” American-style. They will admire our awakening to prejudice but lament the sometimes prejudicial ways in which we acted on our progressive realizations. In this respect America should become more Christian. (There, I said it.) For all our elaborate culture of self-knowledge, for all the hectoring articulateness of our identity vocabularies, we are still, each of us, our own blind spots. We should welcome every person we meet as a small blow against blindness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://libertiesjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/insignia-break.png" width="300" height="127"></p>
<p>The partiality of perspective: this is the great teaching of the contemporary tumult. The problem is that we have not only begun to acknowledge our partiality, and the partiality of others, we have also begun to revere it, and this is a mistake. We are gagging on all our roots. If pain does not provide access to truth, neither does particularity. The worship of particularism is one of the great impediments to social justice, and in its exhilarating way it coarsens us all. In our moral and social thinking, our obsession with otherness has concealed that the foundation of moral and social action is sameness. The “other” is exotic, but there is nothing exotic about the homeless man on the street: he is the same as me, a human being, except that he is hungry and I am not. The difference in our circumstances is not a difference in our definition. When I hand him a few dollars I am not extending myself toward an alien being; I am practicing species solidarity. I am not discovering his humanity; I am responding to it. I am acting, in other words, universally, and none of the social problems that afflict us will be solved unless we recover the universalist standpoint that sees beyond the visible divisions, and is not trapped in, or enraptured by, the specificities of our tribes. Pluralism secures the right to turn inward, but it also broaches the duty to turn outward. By surrounding us with other partialities it legitimates our own partiality, but it also reveals that there is more to the world than what is merely ours.</p>
<p>A great deal has been written in recent years about the discovery of our commonplace biases and the techniques for overcoming them. Much of this literature is psychological, but …</p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time datetime="2020-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">December 30, 2020</time></p><p>For a few months, I’ve been collaborating on the
<a href="https://inet.af/netaddr"><code>inet.af/netaddr</code></a> package for Go which introduces a
new <code>netaddr.IP</code> type as an alternative to the standard library’s
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#IP"><code>net.IP</code></a> type. There are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/inet.af/netaddr#readme-motivation">a variety of reasons
for this</a>, but those are
not the focus of today’s blog.</p><p>The folks over at <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> have been working on
improving the performance of the package in various ways, including shrinking
the size of types and trying out faster internal IP representations.
Specifically, one topic that came up was <a href="https://github.com/inetaf/netaddr/pull/57">how to shrink <code>netaddr.IP</code> from 32
bytes to 24 bytes</a>, the same size
as a Go slice header.</p><p>Because a <code>netaddr.IP</code> can also have an associated zone for IPv6 link-local
addresses, the type previously contained a Go string, which occupies 16 bytes.
This is a good use case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">string
interning</a>, a technique which
can be used to reduce the number of string allocations. It is highly likely that
a small number of zone identifiers will be used repeatedly throughout a program,
so string interning seems like a great fit for this problem.</p><p>In addition, another need for <code>netaddr.IP</code> is to guarantee that identical input
strings will also have identical backing data pointers in the intern pool. This
ensures that the input strings are usable internally as map keys, can occupy
less space in the pool, and can be used to occupy only one word of memory within
the type rather than two, as a Go string header would.</p><p>The result of this work is the package
<a href="https://go4.org/intern"><code>go4.org/intern</code></a> which uses some pretty neat <code>unsafe</code>
tricks to implement efficient string interning using weak references and Go
finalizers. We’ll start by showing off the safe implementation and gradually
introduce the concepts needed to understand the unsafe one as well.</p><p>All credit for the ideas and implementation of <code>go4.org/intern</code> goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave
Anderson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/commaok">Josh Bleecher
Snyder</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a>. I simply watched the discussions
unfold on the issue tracker and thought that the code and the ideas behind it
were too interesting to not write up and share!</p><h2 id="safe-string-interning-in-go">Safe string interning in Go</h2><p>The basic idea of string interning is to retain a global pool of strings which
can be created or fetched on the fly, so that each string is allocated exactly
once for values which are identical. It’s worth noting that since our code will
accept empty <code>interface{}</code>, you could use it with any type which can be used as
a map key. This blog will focus on strings, but the same API could be used for
comparing the equality of a large struct type as well.</p><p>In its most basic form, you could implement <code>go4.org/intern</code> (with a caveat!) by
writing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

<span>// A Value pointer is the handle to an underlying comparable value.
</span><span>// See func Get for how Value pointers may be used.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Value <span>struct</span> {
	<span>// Enforce that Values cannot be used directly for equality comparisons.
</span><span></span>	<span>// We'll explain why a bit later.
</span><span></span>	_      [0]<span>func</span>()
	cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}
}

<span>// Get returns the comparable value passed to the Get func
</span><span>// that returned v.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> (v *Value) Get() <span>interface</span>{} { <span>return</span> v.cmpVal }

<span>// Our pool of interned values and a lock to serialize access.
</span><span></span><span>var</span> (
	mu      sync.Mutex
	val = <span>map</span>[<span>interface</span>{}]*Value{}
)

<span>// Get returns a pointer representing the comparable value cmpVal.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// The returned pointer will be the same for Get(v) and Get(v2)
</span><span>// if and only if v == v2, and can be used as a map key.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// Note that Get returns a *Value so we only return one word of data
</span><span>// to the caller, despite potentially storing a large amount of data
</span><span>// within the Value itself.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> Get(cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}) *Value {
	mu.Lock()
	<span>defer</span> mu.Unlock()

	v := val[cmpVal]
	<span>if</span> v != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Value is already interned in the pool.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> v
	}

	<span>// Value must be created now and then interned.
</span><span></span>	v = &amp;Value{cmpVal: cmpVal}
	val[cmpVal] = v
	<span>return</span> v
}</code></pre></div><p>Usage of the package is straightforward at this point:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> TestBasics(t *testing.T) {
	foo := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)
	foo2 := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)

	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != foo2.Get() {
		t.Error(<span>"foo values differ"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != <span>"foo"</span> {
		t.Error(<span>"foo.Get not foo"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo != foo2 {
		t.Error(<span>"foo pointers differ"</span>)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The global pool in the library stored the string <code>"foo"</code> on the first call to
<code>intern.Get("foo")</code> and the same <code>*intern.Value</code> was returned and stored in both
<code>foo</code> and <code>foo2</code>.</p><p>However there is a caveat to this approach: the pool can never shrink. If we
keep adding more distinct values to the pool, it will continue to grow in size
and allocate more memory until our program eventually runs out of memory and
crashes. Even if we don’t add more values, we’ve still stranded some of our
memory for the entire duration of the program’s execution.</p><p>In fact, this is the tradeoff made by <code>go4.org/intern</code> for the “safe” operating
mode of the package. If you run your program with the environment variable
<code>GO4_INTERN_SAFE_BUT_LEAKY=true</code> then no unsafe tricks will be used, and the
intern pool will continue to grow as more items are added. For some programs,
this may be an acceptable tradeoff, but there’s much more to be discussed!</p><h2 id="breaking-the-unsafe-rules">Breaking the unsafe rules</h2><p>In order to make use of string interning while also cooperating with Go’s
garbage collector to remove and free unused values from the pool, it is
necessary to bend the package <code>unsafe</code> rules. This is what inspired me to author
this blog: I’ve written a lot of unsafe code in the past but have never
intentionally stepped outside the guard rails that the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer"><code>unsafe.Pointer</code> rules
provide for you</a>.</p><p>Specifically, we have to violate rule number 3:</p><blockquote><p>(3) Conversion of a Pointer to a uintptr and back, with arithmetic.</p><p>… Note that both [uintptr and unsafe.Pointer] conversions must appear in the
same expression, with only the intervening arithmetic between them:</p></blockquote><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// INVALID: uintptr cannot be stored in variable
</span><span>// before conversion back to Pointer.
</span><span></span>u := uintptr(p)
p = unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code></pre></div><p>In a hypothetical future version of Go, it is possible that the value stored at
the address pointed at by the <code>p</code> in the Go heap could be moved in between the
conversion and assignment <code>u := uintptr(p)</code> and the pointer arithmetic <code>p =
unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code>.</p><p>Because we are relying on the invariant that the Go garbage collector (as of Go
1.15) does not move data in the heap, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a> came up with a clever pseudo-package
which users can underscore import if they intend to violate this particular
package <code>unsafe</code> rule:
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc"><code>go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc</code></a>.
If a program or its dependencies import this package and a future version of Go
uses a moving garbage collector which may rearrange items in the heap, the
package can be updated to fail compilation when the program’s behavior is now
invalid.</p><p>Technically, Go <em>does</em> have a moving garbage collector for its stacks as of Go
1.15. See <a href="https://github.com/go4org/unsafe-assume-no-moving-gc/issues/3">Matthew Dempsky’s issue for more
details</a>. Because
<code>go4.org/intern</code> stores values in a global map, the values will never be stack
allocated and thus this is not a problem for this particular use case.</p><p>Now that we’ve set the terms of engagement, it’s time to dive in to the unsafe
implementation.</p><h2 id="unsafe-string-interning-in-go">Unsafe string interning in Go</h2><p>We’ll be implementing the package <code>intern</code> code with the same API as before, but
with our newfound <code>unsafe</code> tricks and some <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">Go runtime
finalizers</a> as well.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

down <code>Get</code> and <code>finalize</code> specifically to discuss how these interact with each
other and the Go runtime.</p><p>Starting with <code>Get</code>, we acquire the mutex around the map of interned values,
which now stores the values as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_reference">weak references using
<code>uintptr</code></a> rather than a concrete
<code>*Value</code> type. This ensures that the values are not protected from garbage
collection, and thus we must manually manage their lifecycles by using</p></div></div></div>

But I’m really excited, because I just got the Tetris title screen working!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9JwbvM5phtNcpgBj_2Un5C3QWVLTn24SWN43trTYG7ryH4enLNU6vbMzqMYwridlrhT8HswNBQNVUk19vTe87fsSwvJf0W-IsUEx6j8u13I1zKrktnzabBUzOf3lZcNor0lvGxV" title=""></span></p><p><span>This is the first time I’ve worked on an emulator and </span><span>oh boy</span><span>&nbsp;do I regret taking this long to get around to it. This has been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Not only do I feel like I’m truly gaining a more fundamental understanding of the internals of a machine (which is sort of the point), but it is SO exciting suddenly seeing someone else’s software pop up on the screen.</span></p><p><span>I’m still working on this journey myself but I thought I’d share what I’ve done so far to hopefully encourage others to give this a go.</span></p><p><span>It all started with the bootrom. The gameboy didn’t have an operating system. It simply had a simple bootrom that showed you that famous Nintendo logo (which is actually </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA">a novel DRM scheme</a></span><span>). It’s a very simple program that you can read line by line making it pretty easy to work out where I was going wrong. I started by making a “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></span><span>” which was just a big ol switch statement going through </span><span><a href="https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/">each opcode</a></span><span>. This is definitely the most labour intensive part of the project. There are a lot of opcodes.</span></p><p><span>What you quickly discover while implementing opcodes is that the gameboy memory is basically just an array. So next I created registers and an “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a></span><span>” (the gameboy didn’t really have an MMU but this made things easier to manage). After around four days, I had the Nintendo logo rendering!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xRho4Dq1Fo1vUdM6BNTShSDwfBupG_CSlcrlkG2m9MhC_O75h1T1krLYA16RbOXUSH0BO-W_6u-2B6opnDkgzO3BYHmHJLxgrWbaPEJfbhumMPHAZp0acPT2iL_86tIv3zCLl6DB" title=""></span></p><p><span>Simple rendering is pretty straightforward. The Gameboy would write to a certain region of memory reserved for video so all you need to do is read from there to know what you should render. Once I got that far - I was completely hooked. My approach of just implementing more and more Gameboy hardware was working.</span></p><p><span>There are already a ton of resources that go into far more detail:</span></p><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html">http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU">http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/">https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/</a></span></li></ul><p><span>If you have the time and you’re interested, I would strongly suggest you give this project a go.

<div id="post-body"><p>I have recently bought an e-book by a <a href="https://gumroad.com/dellannaluca">Gumroad author</a> named <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca">Luca Dellana</a>. I have to admit I did it mainly to see how successful authors on Gumroad package their offerings. I was initially skeptical about the book, dismissing it as just another attempt to capitalize on the self-help trend. As I kept reading, however, I found a few clever references washing away my initial skepticism. One quote in particular, stuck in my mind, and I cannot seem to stop thinking about it: </p><blockquote>"If you think about it, the very important never feels urgent. Instead, <strong>most things which feel urgent are important <em>for someone else</em>, not for you."</strong></blockquote><p>Something so simple and yet so difficult to put through common sense. Modern life is full of urgency - from the moment we wake up to the time we go back to bed. Things coming from different directions, fighting for our undivided attention, non-stop.</p><p>The key is this. We acknowledge the presence of <strong>urgency</strong>, however, most of us wrongly attribute <strong>importance</strong> to it, putting the actually important stuff aside. In reality, things that matter usually become urgent when it is too late. In most other times, they are important for someone else, not for us.</p><p>Think about that project at work that so badly needed to be finished before the holidays. It must have brought a ton of pressure to you and your team, hasn't it? Yet, chances are, you would hardly remember it on your deathbed. Neither will your boss or their boss, either. The only person for whom it makes any difference is the one who created the business. If that is not you, I have news - you need to shift your focus. Start with your family and friends, for example. Or your health and passion. The kinds of things you always thought you would resort to doing someday, once you become rich and retired.</p><p>Do them now, instead of when it gets too late.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>«If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it will protect all of you.»<br>
<em>Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I like the quotation above. It’s a powerful statement and one of the reasons why I am not concerned when I hear positions I deeply detest. Well, as long as they are detested by society as well. Because if these people are heard, we just might have something similar to freedom of speech (we don’t have that first amendment in Germany).</p>
<p>But, damn, it’s not easy to listen to positions you don’t like.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of that issue when I tried to listen to a “<a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast/culture-wars-with-andrew-doyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Wars with Andrew Doyle</a>” episode, <a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast-episode/the-misogyny-of-trans-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in which he had Julie Bindel as a guest</a>. She’s a feminist, lesbian, and judging by what I have heard of her, does not like men very much. It’s all patriarchy, men &amp; violence, the whole narrative. At least that how that episode appeared to me.</p>
<p>And after less than half of the episode, I had enough.</p>
<p>I might agree with (part of) her criticism of trans-activists, but the way she talks about men — damn, she appeared to have been stuck in the past. Or rather, in an extremely antiquated view of men. It’s strange how in many other areas we talk about the overlap between men and women being greater than the differences (not in physical strength, but you get the idea), but when it comes to power somehow we are talking about two distinct populations.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>That stick-in-the-mud perspective lost its appeal years ago. Just look at the number of homeless, suicides (actual, not attempts), murders, and much, much more. And sure, when it comes to murder, most of the murderers might me male, but would you really care about the sex of the murderer when you get murdered? I wouldn’t. I found her attitude appalling. And I am — again — very glad I am not a woman. If I had people like her ostensibly speak for me … I’d be mad as hell. Like when it comes to what makes a woman, or whether sex work is demeaning. Seriously? Why not let each person decide for <em>themselves</em> what the fuck that means and how they see that work?</p>
<p>I thought people — and that includes women — should decide for themselves?</p>
<p>And yeah, on another level, it was really funny (for a part of me) to hear that all those <em>unfair</em> strategies, all this emotional reasoning feminists used against men (and women who disagreed), is now used by trans-activists against feminists.</p>
<p>You’ve made your bed, you’ve used those strategies, now how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>But yeah, I take no pleasure in watching the world burn. So no, I don’t really take pleasure from seeing those kind of feminists tasting their own medicine. But even so, I found her views so appalling that I stopped listening. Which I also found interesting. I thought of myself as someone who is willing to differing perspectives, but I guess I found my limits.</p>
<p>And that is actually something valuable I will take from this “conversation”, well listening to that podcast: Nobody listens to you if you disparage their person, no matter how much they might agree with your point.</p>
<p>So, it was <em>surprisingly educating</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p><em>This is the fourth installment of my “year in review” series. 
For a recap, here’s <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-years/">2018</a> 
and <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/the-year-everything-changed/">2017</a>.</em></p>

<p>2020 was my fourth year of building my own internet businesses.
Like everyone else, my 2020 did <em>not</em> go according to plan.
And yet, things worked out in the end.</p>

<p>It was a year of big swings: starting with a taste of celebrity—followed by 
the collapse of my biggest business—and closing with record-breaking success.
Eventually I ended up almost exactly where I planned,
only the route was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of my 2020 in nine pictures.</p>

<h4 id="january-officially-an-indie-hacker">January: officially an Indie Hacker!</h4>

<p>In January, I met and recorded a podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>,
founder of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and a hero of mine. 
When <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/147-cory-zue-of-place-card-me">the podcast aired</a>,
I had a tiny taste of celebrity, hearing from people throughout the Twitter-verse
who were inspired by my story.
It was the most fun moment of my Indie Hacking career.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/first-subscription/me-and-courtland.jpg" alt="Meeting Courtland Allen"></p>

<p>Me and Courtland Allen in his Cape Town Airbnb. January, 2020.</p>

<p>Courtland also convinced me to double down on my <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">wedding place card app</a>—called Place Card Me—leading
to <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/first-subscription/">my first ever subscription revenue online</a>.</p>

<p>The year was looking good!</p>

<h4 id="march-the-pandemic-shakes-things-up">March: the pandemic shakes things up</h4>

<p>Fast forward to mid-March, and the world decided to take Covid-19 very seriously, very fast.</p>

<p>Place Card Me—my primary side-business—saw its revenue plummet to $0 almost overnight.
Not seeing a way to pivot, I decided to pause work on the project indefinitely—now
9 months and counting—and shift my focus to <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Pegasus, my Django boilerplate for SaaS apps</a>.
Sorry, Courtland!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/place-card-me-5-weeks-corona.png" alt="Place Card Me Revenue Feb-March"></p>

<p>Place Card Me’s revenue, late Feb - April 1. It has sinced picked up a bit, but remains
well off 2019’s numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Africa—where I live—introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world,
including banning alcohol sales and disallowing outdoor exercise.
I had to resort to running in circles around my flat.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/lockdown-run.png" alt="Lockdown Run"></p>

<p>My lockdown running route. Hundreds of circles around my small flat. March, 2020.</p>

<p>The lockdown also took away our childcare, so my wife and I split the work day in half.
My productive hours ended at noon, most of my time went to my day job,
and my side-businesses languished.</p>

<h4 id="may-my-first-record-breaking-month-of-the-year">May: my first record-breaking month of the year</h4>

<p>In May we got childcare back and for the first time in months I had time for proactive work.</p>

<p>I started by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/may-2020/">experimenting with some pricing changes</a> 
leading to Pegasus earning over $4,000—more than any of my products had ever earned in a single month.
I had to re-do the axes on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open">side-project dashboard</a>—where I track
my product revenue and effort—to accommodate the new high.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/pegasus-y-axis.png" alt="Pegasus Breaking the Chart"></p>

<p>Pegasus income breaks the chart on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side project dashboard</a>. May, 2020.</p>

<h4 id="july-august-distractions-and-failure">July-August: distractions and failure</h4>

<p>July and August saw my biggest divergence of the year.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be a good opportunity to exercise Pegasus, I decided to build and launch
a new product to provide <a href="https://repostory.app/">code review analytics for Github repositories</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before I finished MVP I realized the project was too ambitious for the 
amount of time I was willing to devote to it.
So, following a lackluster launch, and seeing a long road ahead, 
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/aug-2020/">I decided to stop working on it indefinitely</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/repostory-social.png" alt="RepoStory"></p>

<p>RepoStory: my failed experiment building code review analytics product, launched to no one in August.</p>

<p>I still think the project has potential, but for now it’s lying idle.</p>

<h4 id="september-hello-world">September: hello world!</h4>

<p>September marked the arrival of our new son Victor into the world.
I learned that <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/new-parent-again/">being a parent is easier the second time around</a>—except
for the <em>other</em> kid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/new-parent-again/victor-sleep.jpg" alt="Hello Victor"></p>

<p>Our new son Victor, born September 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on paternity leave I stumbled upon a diagram labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">Ikigai</a>—that 
I later learned was <em>not</em> Ikigai—that made me question about my chosen career.</p>

<p>Specifically, I felt like I was doing well with everything <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/ikigai/">except possibly “what the world needs”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/not-ikigai.jpg" alt="Not Ikigai"></p>

<p>This diagram, often attributed as the Japanese concept of Ikigai, was actually
created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmograma">Andrés Zuzunaga</a>.</p>

<p>So, I devoted a chunk of the last three months of the year to trying to explore the topic of a “meaningful” life
and career more seriously.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/how-to-save-the-world/">turns out this is hard</a>!</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I figure it out.</p>

<h4 id="november-another-record-breaking-month">November: another record-breaking month</h4>

<p>Back on the business-side of things, at the end of November, I ran an impulse Black Friday sale,
leading to another record-breaking month for Pegasus and 
me—outstripping my previous monthly high by almost $3,000.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/total-profits-social.png" alt="Black Friday"></p>

<p>The massive spike from the Pegasus Black Friday sale. November, 2020.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">my write-up on the sale</a> made 
the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, resulting in about 10,000
visitors to my website and leading to another few Pegasus sales.</p>

<p>After the whole saga, I was suddenly within reach of my 2020 profit target of $42k that
I’d all-but abandoned post-Covid.</p>

<h4 id="december-rr">December: R&amp;R</h4>

<p>Finally, rounding out the year amidst another Covid surge and lockdown in South Africa
with the family and some time off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/family-holidays.jpg" alt="Family Holidays"></p>

<p>While alcohol sales are again closed in South Africa, at least the national parks are open. December, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="profits">Profits</h2>

<p>When all was said and done, <strong>total profits on the year from personal projects came in just over $43,000</strong>—or
about $1k higher than <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">my goal set in January</a>.
Given how hard the pandemic hit Place Card Me, I’m quite proud to have still hit that target.</p>

<p>Here’s the last four years of product income—broken out by product.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/profits-by-year.png" alt="Profits by year"></p>

<p>Annual profits by product. Now available on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side-project dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Place Card Me ended up down about 42% on the year, but Pegasus more than made up for it,
growing from $4,000 to almost $30,000 in a single year—or about <em>double</em> 
what I had forecasted at the start of the year.</p>

<p>More on this later.</p>

<h2 id="time-spend">Time spend</h2>

<p>I logged just under 2,000 hours this year. 
This works out almost exactly to a standard 40-hour-a-week, 52-week work-year,
which makes it easier to think about the time distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/2020-time.png" alt="2020 time"></p>

<p>In terms of a calendar year breakdown, about four months went to my day job at Dimagi,
three months went to Pegasus, six weeks went to email and writing,
another five weeks went to exercise(!), and then the rest fell into smaller buckets.</p>

<p>I’m happy with this breakdown, though I would prefer if the amount of “day job” time was a bit
less and the amount of “exploration” time was a bit more.
Something to think about for 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>If 2020 was the year of Pegasus then 2021 will be the year of…well…also Pegasus.</p>

<p>Yep, for the third year running, <strong>I’m planning for Pegasus to be my main hustle</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><em>Because it still feels like Pegasus is in its first act</em>.</p>

<p>A year into Place Card Me the product felt basically complete.
I could add features, improve marketing, etc. but there weren’t any easy ways to grow it without 
fundamentally changing the product in some way.
Place Card Me made place cards well. Where do you go from there?</p>

<p>Pegasus on the other hand, seems to have limitless possibility.
The core product itself can continue getting better, with lots of features to add and improvements to 
make—some of which are already in flight. Plus, it’s fun as hell.</p>

<p>But even Pegasus itself is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Could Pegasus have a plug-in marketplace where other developers can earn money extending it?
Could Pegasus have a jobs board to connect Django developers to my customers who need help on their projects?
Could Pegasus offer Django courses or books?
Or a hosted way to deploy your Django apps to the cloud?</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/183-chris-oliver-of-gorails">Chris Oliver has done for Ruby on Rails</a>, 
there appear to be an infinite amount of Pegasus-adjacent opportunities to create new products, offerings,
and build out the Pegasus ecosystem—all of which are aligned with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah. Already my most profitable product by a lot and still in act one.
Hopefully exciting times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="2021-targets">2021 Targets</h2>

<p>The other big decision I’ve made about 2021 is that it’s time to flip the narrative 
of what I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>For the last four years I’ve thought of myself as a professional developer/freelancer who also played around
on the internet trying to make money from side-hustles.</p>

<p>But barring an unexpected turn of events—<em>I expect 2021 to be the first year I make
the majority of my income from my own businesses</em>.
A change I hope just might hold for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>the side hustles have become the main hustle.</em>
<strong>I’m no longer a <em>side-project</em> entrepreneur. I’m a mother-fucking <em>real entrepreneur</em>.</strong></p>

<p>So, here are my targets for 2020:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Earn $65k Profit from personal projects.</li>
  <li>Spend the majority of my time working for myself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to own this thing!
I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Random forests are great as baseline models, better than GBDTs like xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost.</li>
  <li>The other side of the coin: don’t expect a lot of improvement from tuning random forests.</li>
  <li>When tuning hyperparameters, choose at least one to explore bagging, one to explore subspace sampling, and one (preferably two) to control model complexity.</li>
  <li>Most papers on this have flaws. This essay is an interim report on the <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles">WIP benchmark</a> we are doing.</li>
</ul>



<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01914">A Comparative Analysis of XGBoost</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, the authors analyzed the gains from doing hyperparameter tuning on 28 datasets (classification tasks). scikit-learn’s RandomForestClassifier, with default hyperparameter values,</p>
<ul>
  <li>did better than xgboost models (default hyperparameter values) in 17/28 datasets (61%)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, and</li>
  <li>did better than tuned xgboost models (trained on 3840 hyperparameter configurations) in 9/28 datasets (32%)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Random forests are great baseline models - it’s hard to train a poorly performing random forest. With xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost, you not only have to tune more hyperparameters to get good results, but you also have to tune the number of trees in the ensemble, adding a lot of runtime to your experiments (you barely have to tune the number of trees in a random forest). There is a reason why random forests are more popular than more-advanced GBDT and variants (as implemented in xgboost/ lightgbm/ catboost)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So while GBDTs are great for kaggle competitions, random forests are an integral part of the practising data scientist’s toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-essay">
Why this essay?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random forests have a reputation for not being very tunable: while the default values of hyperparameters will often produce a good enough random forest, on the downside tuning a lot of parameters does not produce a lot of improvements in model performance.</p>

<p>The typical implementation of random forests has too many parameters for us to tune all of them together, and the gain from doing so is not expected to be significant anyway. In the wild, we see all sorts of subsets of the hyperparameters being tuned, without much empirical sense behind it.</p>

<p>We haven’t found any concise overview of best practices for tuning hyperparameters for random forests, so we wrote one. If you know of such a guide, please let us know <a href="https://twitter.com/dataBiryani">@dataBiryani</a>. Besides, we wanted to run our own experiments to validate the papers we read. Some of those experiments are included in the accompanying repo<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>



<p>Before jumping into details, we’ll put some structure into how we think about the hyperparameters found in random forest implementations. Those hyperparameters typically relate to one of the following aspects of training an RF:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrapping (bagging)</li>
  <li>Subspace sampling</li>
  <li>Base-model complexity and regularization</li>
</ul>

<p>To understand where this comes from, let’s quickly review how random forests are constructed.</p>

<h2 id="how-random-forests-work">
How random forests work</h2>

<p>Random forests are collections of independently-constructed decision trees. Here is how we construct those individual trees:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a <strong>bootstrapped</strong> sample: We create a subset of all available observations by repeatedly sampling one observation at a time, typically with replacement.</li>
  <li>Train the decision tree
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>subspace sampling</strong> at every node: Every time we need to split a node in the decision tree, we consider only a subset of the features (subspace sample) from the bootstrapped sample (instead of all features).</li>
      <li>control <strong>Base-model complexity</strong> and prevent overfitting with <strong>regularization</strong>: To maximize the ensemble performance, we must make the right choice in bias/variance trade-off. Decision trees offer a lot of hyperparameters to control the bias/variance trade-off by manipulating the complexity and size of the base learners generated. Bootstrapping and subspace sampling parameters contribute to this as well, but we consider them separately. Also, most hyperparameters manipulating base-model complexity have some amount of regularisation effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aggregate the trees: For a given observation, we create an ensemble prediction by taking the predictions from individual trees and taking the mode (classification) or averaging the values (regression). The earlier bootstrapping, followed by this aggregating, is called <strong>bagging</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hyperparameters-of-random-forest">
Hyperparameters of random forest</h2>

<p>In this essay, we’ll look at the implementation of random forests in sklearn (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html">RandomForestClassifier</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html">RandomForestRegressor</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/random-forests-hyperparameters.png" alt=""></p>



<p>We propose that instead of tuning a mish-mash of hyperparameters, we tune some hyperparameters from each of the groups we listed above: Bootstrapping (bagging), Subspace sampling, and Base-model complexity/regularization.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we go a little deeper into how we should choose hyperparameters from each of those three groups.</p>

<h2 id="the-experiment">
The experiment</h2>

<p>We looked at a few research papers to find meta-experiments around hyperparameter tuning of random forests. However, we came up short because of a few reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The tuning is done only for small datasets, which we felt was not representative of the kind of models that are trained in practice today.</li>
  <li>It was hard to reproduce the experiments. Some involved hard-to-obtain datasets, and in some cases a few datasets have been lost.</li>
  <li>We wanted to look deeper into the model tuning - not only the score and hyperparameter-configuration of the top model but of a few more models at the top.</li>
  <li>We believed better tuning was needed to draw fairer conclusions. Sometimes not the right subsets were tuned, sometimes not enough tuning was done (too few configurations), and sometimes the values chosen were rather extreme for the given datasets!</li>
</ol>

<p>So we started our own benchmarking exercise, the code and output of which is available at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/tree/main/random_forest/">https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/tree/main/random_forest/</a>. It is still a work in progress. We started with the smallest datasets in the <a href="https://docs.openml.org/benchmark/#openml-cc18">openml-cc18 benchmark</a><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and so far have added 41 datasets to our benchmark. More details can be found in the repo.</p>

<p>The summary of the dataset and the results is <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/openml_experiments.csv">available here</a><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrappingbagging">
Bootstrapping/Bagging</h2>

<h3 id="n_estimators">
n_estimators</h3>

<p>While <code>n_estimators</code>, the number of trees in the ensemble, is critical to the success of the random forest, it is also the easiest to tune - simply set it to a large enough number.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324">Random forests</a><sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> paper, Breiman proved that generalization errors for classification and regression random forests converge as the number of trees grows. Moreover, in the paper <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/17-269/17-269.pdf">To tune or note to tune the number of trees in random forest</a><sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>, the authors provide theoretical and empirical validity to the monotonicity of the performance measure curve for a combination of tasks and performance metrics (e.g., logloss for classification). It follows that the measure will keep improving as we increase the number of trees, eventually leveling off.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of smallish datasets for specific combinations of tasks and performance metrics (e.g., AUC for classification), they find that the monotonicity doesn’t hold, and very specific non-monotonous patterns are exhibited (as can be seen below).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/random_forest_number_of_trees_non_monotonous.png" alt="" title="From 'To tune or not to tune the number of trees in random forest?'"></p>

<p>In these cases (about 10% of the datasets they analyzed), the error rate curves, after reaching their lowest values, gradually rise again as the number of trees grows, eventually to converge at a value very slightly higher than the lowest value achieved before. Quoting from the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the curve grows again after reaching its lowest value, leading to a value at 2000 trees that is by at least 0.005 bigger than the lowest value of the OOB error rate curve for $T \in [10, 150]$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using math and empirical analysis, they describe the kind of small datasets exhibiting this behaviour, where chasing this kind of minuscule improvement in model performance is perhaps not very meaningful given the associated computational costs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In practice, we should set <code>n_estimators</code> to a computationally feasible large number and not spend time tuning it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/high_mfeat-factors.png" alt="" title="The dataset 'mfeat-factors' has the highest number of datapoints (#samples x #features) among the 41 datasets in the benchmark. This is the parallel coordinates plot depicting top 5 models from the 500 RF models on the dataset using RandomSearchCV."></p>

<p>The parallel coordinates plot above shows the top 5 models from the 500 trained on the ‘mfeat-factors’ dataset that has the highest number of datapoints (#samples x #features) among the 41 datasets in the benchmark. As we can see, there is a model with just 100 trees almost matching the top-performing model. The story remains the same when we consider other datasets with high (<a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_electricity.png">electricity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_optdigits.png">optdigits</a>) or low (<a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_balance-scale.png">balance-scale</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_ilpd.png">ilpd</a>) number of data points.</p>

<h3 id="bootstrap">
bootstrap</h3>

<p>If bootstrap is <code>False</code>, the whole dataset is used to build the trees (no bagging), significantly taking away our ability to make an effective bias-variance trade-off. We almost never have to tune this.</p>

<h3 id="max_samples">
max_samples</h3>

<p>With <code>n_estimators</code> and <code>bootstrap</code> not providing many opportunities for tuning, <code>max_samples</code> (default value of 1.0) is the only hyperparameter left that we can use to tune bagging. We again turn to parallel coordinate plots for some empirical guidance.</p>

<p>If we look at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/high_electricity.png">electricity</a>, high values of <code>max_samples</code> seem to be effective (all hyperparameters seem to be in a stable region as well). This is not a lot of value-add though, as the default value is 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/high_electricity.png" alt="" title="parallel coordinate plots for 'electricity'"></p>

<p>On the other hand, if we look at <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/output/tuning_hiplot/low_balance-scale.png">balance-scale</a>, low values of <code>max_samples</code> seem to be effective. Tuning the parameter here was very valuable, as most of the top models have low values of <code>max_samples</code> (far from the default value of 1).</p>

<p><img src="https://databiryani.com/images/random-forest-tuning/low_balance-scale.png" alt="" title="parallel coordinate plots for 'balance-scale'"></p>

<p>You can look at the other plots we linked to above, or play with any of the datasets using <a href="https://github.com/soumendra/principled-hp-tuning-tree-based-ensembles/blob/main/random_forest/hiplot.ipynb">the notebook in the repo</a> to see that it makes sense to tune <code>max_samples</code> well.</p>

<p>If computational power is not a bottleneck, you can simply tune it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been about a year since I published a post. From <a href="https://johanoakes.com/blog/12/03/2019/advent-day-1"><em>First Sunday of Advent</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll try to post a daily update; hopefully, a new generative piece everyday explaining the logic behind the engineering decisions and what I've learned. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hahahahaha. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abort,_Retry,_Fail%3F">Abort, Retry, Fail?</a> (<em>Don't be surprised to see this as a future blog post title</em> 👀). Anywho, you know what they say, don't publicize your goals. Hopefully, this upcoming year, I'll be more honest to myself, but in my defense, I have spent the year accruing a long list of potential blog ideas; the first idea being an elementary post-mortem analysis and presentation of how I debug memory exceptions in Java.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction permalink"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>My goal is to deliver a brief presentation of how I debug Java memory exceptions in my local environment. I am not going to scrutinize production-grade tools (e.g. <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/">YourKit Java Profiler</a>, New Relic, or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-4/jfr-runtime-guide/about.htm#JFRUH170">Java Flight Recorder</a>), though some tools may be used to fix production issues. Essentially, I want to provide some context around Java memory exceptions in terms of how I first encountered and had to debug a problem in my application, the routes explored and tools used to inspect and identify the memory exceptions, and suggestions for mitigating future issues. With any luck, the reader should get a glimpse and a curiosity for how memory works in Java and the tools available so that they'll be able to prevent memory exceptions or find and fix any memory leak errors that may occur.</p>

<h2 id="context"><a href="#context" aria-label="context permalink"></a>Context</h2>
<p>I won't go into the business purpose of the application, from here on out referred to as "KnowledgeDB", from which I had to debug memory exceptions due to legal reasons. Better safe than really, really sorry. However, KnowledgeDB is primarily a monolith backed by Spring Boot with a React frontend hosted on RHEL7 instances and supported by Kubernetes (<em>that was a mouthful</em>). Unfortunately, KnowledgeDB would come crashing down every couple months. Our team would wake up in the morning to a couple emails that our application's Spring Boot services were unresponsive. Luckily for us, our frontend was geared to display an error when data retrieval failed, so all our team had to do was restart the Kubernetes pod hosting our backend services. </p>
<p>To avoid further embarrasment and lost value, we wanted to make sure that we understood why our application's services crashed every two to three months. Without understanding the fundamental problem, memory usage stability is not guaranteed and the services will crash eventually.</p>
<h2 id="identifying-the-problem"><a href="#identifying-the-problem" aria-label="identifying the problem permalink"></a>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>Before I delve into KnowledgeDB's specific problem, it is worthwile to take a step back and produce a plan of attack. Listed below are a sequence of questions that may help when investigating a memory leak so that we're not shuffling around like headless chickens: </p>
<h3 id="questions-to-ask"><a href="#questions-to-ask" aria-label="questions to ask permalink"></a>Questions to Ask</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do I have a memory leak?</li>
<li>Which classes are leaking?</li>
<li>What is keeping these objects alive (an instance in the application)?</li>
<li>Where is it leaking from, or where in the code are these objects created and/or assigned? </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hunting-down-the-memory-leak"><a href="#hunting-down-the-memory-leak" aria-label="hunting down the memory leak permalink"></a>Hunting Down the Memory Leak</h3>
<p>After inspecting the logs, the stacktrace seemed standard: <em>Exception in thread &lt;thread_name&gt;: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, the error is thrown when there is insufficient space to allocate an object in the Java heap. In this case, the garbage collector (GC) cannot make space available to accommodate a new object, and the heap cannot be expanded further. <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our initial observations were clear: the exception occurred periodically, around two to three months, and the issue was NOT behavior driven (i.e. if users went to a certain web page or performed a certain operation, the application would halt and catch fire). KnowledgeDB seemed to work as expected until its breaking point. Since our application lived on Kubernetes pods that were not brought down, we hypothesized that our long-lived application may be unintentially holding references to objects which were unable to be garbage-collected, a memory leak. </p>
<p>From the initial observations, our team decided to run the application overnight and investigate the logs to spot irregularities. For example, was garbage collection being performed routinely? Additionally, we wanted to create a unit test(s), or use a load testing tool, to initiate an expensive operation with deterministic memory pressure. If the memory grew proportionally to the number of requests, then the memory leak should be fixable - we would just have to track where in our application code the objects were being created.</p>

<h3 id="visualvm-and-eclipse-mat"><a href="#visualvm-and-eclipse-mat" aria-label="visualvm and eclipse mat permalink"></a>VisualVM and Eclipse MAT</h3>
<p>Due to the relatively simple GUI and its integration with IntelliJ, VisualVM is the tool that I've used the most to inspect the performance and quality of my application code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Java VisualVM enables developers to generate and analyze heap dumps, track down memory leaks, perform and monitor garbage collection, and perform lightweight memory and CPU profiling. <sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, VisualVM does a lot to paint a simple picture of the application's performance. On top of it's fundamental abilties, VisualVM can be extended through plugins like Visual GC. Either way, it's a good idea to run VisualVM in the background during local development to have a sense of security that the application is performing as expected. </p>
<p>Anywho, it doesn't take much to get a basic view of your application's memory usage. First, VisualVM is generally found in your JDK's bin folder as <em>jvisualvm.exe</em>. If you're using JDK 9 or greater, you may need to download the executable through the application's <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/download.html">website</a>. After starting VisualVM, navigate to the <em>Monitor</em> tab for the appropriate application, and you should see, among a host of other metrics, a graph for memory. After running your application for a while, waiting until it gets to a "stable" state when all initialization is complete, and generating some object creation and deletion by interacting with your application, you should see the memory graph take the form of a sawtooth pattern like below: </p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/oakejp12/Graphics/blob/master/HuntingDownMemoryLeaks/good_visualvm.png?raw=true" alt="Healthy Memory Usage - VisualVM"></p>
<p>A sawtooth pattern usually denotes a healthy application. Over time, as objects are created through interaction with the application, the used heap will grow. At a certain point, garbage colleciton will kick in, and you'll see a steep drop of memory representing a shift of resources, or deletion of a alot unnessary objects. Please note that different applications render different memory graphs, but overall, you should NOT be seeing the used heap consume the total heap size.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, if you see something like the graph below then you may have stumbled unto a memory leak. There are indications of garbage collection by the small dips, but over time (or in this case, instantly), the used heap grows closer to the heap size. At some point, the heap will not be expanded further, and the garbage collector will not be able to make space available to accommodate a new object.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/oakejp12/Graphics/blob/master/HuntingDownMemoryLeaks/bad_visualvm.png?raw=true" alt="Unhealthy Memory Usage - VisualVM"></p>
<p>If you encounter a graph like the one above, you've answered your first question: do I have a memory leak? So what now? One more tool you can add to your belt is the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/mat/">Eclipse MAT (Memory Analyzer Tool)</a>. By generating a heap dump through Visual VM and loading the HPROF binary-formatted file to Eclipse MAT, you'll be able to investigate the heap, generate reports to check for leak suspects, and analyze objects for suspected memory issues. Tools like Eclipse MAT will be able to help you answer questions 2-4: which classes are leaking and where is it leaking from. </p>
<p>An alternative to generating heap dumps through Visual VM or another tool is to supply the <em>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</em> VM flag when starting your application. This will automatically create a heap dump file when you get an OutOfMemory error. I'll go more into VM arguments in Part II of this series.</p>
<h3 id="gc-logs"><a href="#gc-logs" aria-label="gc logs permalink"></a>gc-logs</h3>
<p>If you're opposed to running yet another GUI application in the background, you have the option to turn on verbose garbage collection logs for an application. By default, the GC log is written to <em>stdout</em>, but my recommendation is to provide a log file path and tail those logs while the application is running by using the following commands: <code>tail -f &lt;gc-log-file-path&gt;</code> in Unix or <code>Get-Content &lt;gc-log-file-path&gt; -Wait</code> in Powershell. GC logging can be enabled by passing the below VM arguments during application startup: </p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code>
-verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:<span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span>


-Xlog:gc*:file<span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span>


-Xlog:gc*:file<span>=</span><span>\</span>"<span>&lt;</span>gc-log-file-path<span>&gt;</span><span>\</span>"</code></pre></div>
<p>I've attached a GC log from a sample application exposing a soft memory leak below:</p>

<h2>Joy of Lisp.</h2>

<p>Ten years ago myself, Ray McDermott and Kristof Sajdak fell in love with functional programming; we marveled at its ease of expression, simplicity, and immutable data structures.</p>

<p>After reading the now classic <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf" title="[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, this only made functional programming more attractive.  It seemed to be what we had been missing in the typical enterprise landscape, which at that time, was full of Java and .Net. It was a literal <em>where have you been all my life</em> moment as the beauty of it struck a chord with all of us.</p>

<p>From there, we never looked back – with our eyes now wide open, we had seen the promise of the future, and the current languages just wouldn’t cut it any longer.  Outside of our world, other factors that contributed to functional languages’ perfect timing for emergence included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law was topping out</li>
<li>Lower cost multi-core CPUs were now mainstream</li>
<li>Parallel architectures were appearing, and</li>
<li>Jaded developers, were frustrated with their languages</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Odersky’s Scala programming language was the subject of significant press attention and turned many people like us onto the possibility of using functional programming for the enterprise, but it wasn’t quite right, it was’t a Lisp.</p>

<h2>Hello Clojure.</h2>

<pre><code>(ns hello-clojure.core)
(defn -main [&amp; args]
    (println "Hello, Clojure!"=))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Around this same period, Rich Hickey’s Clojure came to our attention, with the simplicity of Lisp, a REPL, immutability and, critically, first-class host language interop. With Interop, we were no longer in a walled garden that restricted so many other, purer implementations. Rich’s pragmatic choices and the resultant capabilities of Clojure ticked all the boxes. It also seemed to do the impossible: re-invigorating and exciting the development teams.</p>

<p>We started using Clojure where we could and where it proved viable.  Areas where we identified uses were primarily in applications where there was little or no existing code in place and no overriding requirement to adhere to a corporate standard. No going back now, we were all in.</p>

<h2>Enter ClojureScript.</h2>

<pre><code>
(ns todomvc.views
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]
            [re-frame.core :refer [subscribe dispatch]]
            [clojure.string :as str]))
</code>
</pre>

<p>ClojureScript goes everywhere; it can get to places that Clojure can’t go. It does this by piggybacking on the reach claim from JavaScript, and we can keep it functional.</p>

<p>We want our product to be able to reach any possible location, inside a car key fob, IoT devices, smart homes, and cities. ClojureScript is now mature enough to use everywhere, but it wasn’t always this way of course.</p>

<p>Looking back to 2010, I wanted to go way more mobile, and I had a desire to make the companies’ tech more ubiquitous for it to be deployed on iOS/Android/Tractors/Cars and we couldn’t do this in a functional programming way. Ray was using Clojure on Cloud PaaS and Web, continuing to leverage the JVM and Clojure to achieve great things.  Kristof and I worked on making connected cars “Restful” and idempotent, and JavaScript &amp; JSON made that happen for us; there just wasn’t a way to do this with functional programming.</p>

<p>As good as Clojure was we couldn’t use it where we wanted and felt like it was a vast chasm to cross for the reach that we desired to become a reality.</p>

<p>What we didn’t know then is that two future members of our team where actively solving this problem.</p>

<p>Mike Fikes built <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby" title="Goby" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goby</a>, a hybrid iOS app technology using ClojureScript and Objective-C and released it into the App Store. I understand that Facebook’s Lee Byron saw this, and it probably inspired Facebook towards going in this direction. Coincidently, David Nolen was asked by Facebook to speak at the React.JS conference around the same time. This led to both Mike and David being granted access to the React Native Github repository, which was closed to the public as it was still alpha.  Subsequently, Mike became the first person to get <a href="https://twitter.com/mfikes/status/573918846890938368?lang=en" title="ClojureScript working with React Native" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript working with React Native.</a></p>

<p>Separately &amp; together Mike and David worked on projects such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/" title="Om" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Om</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mfikes/ambly" title="Ambly" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ambly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/replete-repl/replete-ios" title="Replete" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replete</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/planck-repl/planck" title="Planck" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planck</a></li>
<li>and of course the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript" title="ClojureScript" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript</a> compiler itself</li>
</ul>

<p>They blazed a trail that we now take for granted.</p>

<p>We came into Vouch with a long-held belief of consuming technology where no competitive advantage was needed and where differentiation is not a critical factor; this allows us to move quickly without us needing to become experts in commodity technologies.</p>
<p>Therefore we stand on the shoulders of many industry giants. Examples of this would be <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel" title="Figwheel" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figwheel</a>, created by Bruce Hauman, which has revolutionized the way we build UI, and Blockchain, and provided a way to create absolute trust.  To make our platform work with these great technologies, we needed flexibility and modularity for our technology.</p>

<p>Our approach has always been to use the right tool for the right job, first and foremost, it just so happens that that has been ClojureScript.</p>

<h2>Attracting World-Class Talent.</h2>

<p>We started Vouch with a core team, myself, Ray and Kristof, who had worked together for many years before Vouch.  We quickly came to a point where we needed to expand the development team with skilled engineers who shared our vision and passion for building the company we wanted to create.</p>

<p>A company’s product vision, culture, and outcomes are not the only considerations for attracting world-class engineers to join a team; technology choices are just as critical, which has been one of my maxims for success over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Great people want to work on great teams using great technologies, to build great products.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While our team shares a common interest in Clojure/ClojureScript, more importantly, we all wanted to work within a great team, using great technologies, to build great products.</p>

<p>The team is growing and attracting seriously world-class talent faster than we can onboard them.  It might just be the best problem I have ever had to solve for. Recently Mike commented, <em>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could build a team that could make all the tools we wanted to use to develop our products?”,</em> I could not have agreed more.</p>

<h2>Community.</h2>

<p>The Vouch team began getting deeper into the  Clojure community by first attending and then speaking at conferences. Ray started to host the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a>  podcast, which led to an introduction and later joining of Mike Fikes to the Vouch team.  Mike then introduced David Nolen who subsequently joined the team.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is here to stay, loved by the team and obviously, we have David and Mike who are the lead committers of the language and compiler respectively.  Ray hosts the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/defn" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a> podcast and also started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UxEQuBvfLJgWR5tk_XIXA" title="Apropos" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apropos</a>. Our team speaks publicly and regularly at ClojureScript or related conferences. We invest in this language, we craft solutions using its strengths, we speak publicly about it, we educate people about it and most of all, we care for it.</p>

<h2>So are we actually betting the company on ClojureScript?</h2>

<p>In just 18 months with a small but highly skilled team, we have been able to conceive of, prototype, design, build and implement a breakthrough product that we believe will fundamentally alter the way that people, devices, software and processes interact digitally based on improving trust between those parties. I can honestly say that ClojureScript has been a substantial contributing factor to making this possible and in many ways, our product has become a poster child for the language.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is one of the most valuable tools available to us, and we use it where it makes sense to do so.  I’m not sure if we even consider this as a bet, but if it is, then it’s the safest bet we will ever make.</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

Therefore, the only sensible bet is to believe in God. This has come to be known as <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-pascals-wager-is-eminently-modern" target="_blank">Pascal’s wager</a>.</p><p>It has a surprising number of applications beyond concerns for a comfortable afterlife. There are many things for which the value of believing something or not can be seen as a cost-versus-likely-benefit wager,&nbsp;often without regard to the actual truth of the matter. Since science does not profess to have a final truth, and in many areas freely admits its incomplete knowledge, Pascal’s wager can provide a useful method of deciding between two alternatives.</p><blockquote><p>All drugs and treatments have side effects, but vaccines in general have the fewest.</p> </blockquote><p>For example, it seems that a significant percentage of the population is suspicious of science, or so we are told. We often hear that some large number, approaching or exceeding half of Americans, do not believe in evolution. This seems remarkable on the face of it because there is no viable scientific opposition to evolution and it is widely accepted by biologists and other life scientists as being fundamental to understanding biology—from genetics to medicine.<br></p><p>What we are not often told is that most of those who answer negatively about believing in evolution nonetheless understand evolution—or at least the basics of it. They are not stupid, ignorant, or uninformed. They have simply made a Pascalian wager. What benefit, we might ask, is derived from believing in evolution rather than a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/how-to-weed-creationism-out-of-schools" target="_blank">divine creation</a>? Unless you are a professional biologist, it is hard to see how this would affect your everyday life. On the other hand, professing a belief in Darwinian evolution over the biblical narrative will likely ostracize you from family, friends, co-workers, your church community—in short most of your social infrastructure. Place your bets.</p><p>Can we apply any of this to decisions over the current controversy surrounding vaccination—and in particular the newly arrived COVID-19 vaccine?</p><p>There are certainly reasons to be concerned about being vaccinated, and it would be a gross over-simplification to consider anyone who expresses reticence about taking a vaccine, this new vaccine in particular, as being just plain dumb or scientifically illiterate or gullible. They need be none of these things and still may be suspicious of the vaccine.<br></p><p>One issue is safety. The vaccine, any vaccine, is designed to mobilize your immune system, essentially to fool it into believing that there is an invading virus present and to mount an immune response. That way it will be ready when the real invasion comes, if it comes. This seems pretty sensible and preferable to going to war with an opponent you know nothing about. But still, it is fooling around with Mother Nature and some people are uneasy about that. Although it must be pointed out that the virus is not at all shy about fooling around with your immune system and many other parts of you, so letting it have its way is not good policy, either.</p><p>What about a vaccine made of genes? This vaccine is being produced by what is being touted as a new method using RNA—genes. While it is true that for entirely economic reasons, this is the first vaccine to be produced in this way, the method is not really new and the science that makes it possible has been developing over the last 40 years. So it’s not so radical as the press makes it seem.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is true that this method uses RNA, genetic material, to make the vaccine. We hear a lot about gene modification and the potential dangers associated with it. Why then am I going to allow RNA, genes, to be injected into me? The first thing to realize is that this is exactly what the virus does—so whether you get a vaccine or an infection, you are getting genes injected into you. The virus RNA encodes around 12 functional genes (by comparison humans and other mammals have around 25,000 genes). The virus only contains the genes to make a new virus—it does not have any of the capabilities of a normal cell to actually turn those genes into the proteins that make up the complete virus. It hijacks your cells to do this—and that’s how it sickens you, by forcing your cells to make new viruses instead of what they should be doing.</p><blockquote><p>Vaccines have fewer side effects than virtually any other drug you wouldn’t even think twice about taking.</p> </blockquote><p>Now the new vaccines have taken just one of those genes—the one that directs the production of the now infamous spike protein that appears on the surface of a normal virus—and injects just that one gene into your muscle cells, which then make that one single protein. Your immune system comes along and sees that weird protein and makes antibodies to it. These same antibodies will now recognize the spike protein on the surface of any viral particles that invade your body. We have effectively turned the virus into its own enemy.</p><p>The viral RNA that you are getting will decompose over a few days because RNA is not a stable molecule (that, by the way, is why the vaccine needs to be kept frozen) and it will no longer exist in your body. It could only become a permanent part of your genome if it were a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule—and even the chances of that happening would be chemically remote. So regardless of how it sounds, this may actually be the safest sort of vaccine to use. In the future it is likely that all vaccines will be made this way.</p><p><span>T</span>hen, of course, there is the issue of who is running this whole vaccine program—the government and the pharmaceutical industry. These are the guys who brought you opioid addiction, death by Vioxx, soaring drug prices, the worst health-care system in the developed world, regulations where you don’t need them and none where you do—am I really going to trust this cast of so-called “inept villains,” as some believe, to dictate my personal health choices? Do we know for sure that the claims of efficacy are real or just made up to sell some worthless procedure? It would not be the first time. (I would not, on the other hand, worry about Bill Gates having a chip inserted into you along with the vaccine—if you use any social media, navigational tools, or purchase anything online, then Bill Gates already knows more about you than he will get from any injectable chip. So that train has left the station.)</p><p>All this and a few lesser issues are worth a pause, for sure. But we must also look on the positive side of the ledger. Why trust science? Modern medicine and the science behind it has eliminated or dramatically lessened such scourges as smallpox, polio, cholera, chicken pox, measles, rabies, and dozens of other killer pathogens that had previously wiped out enormous numbers of people, in some cases significant parts of entire generations. Don’t we depend on science for much of the comfort and safety of our everyday lives? Isn’t science the way we heat our homes, drive to work, fly around the world, have dependable food? Yes, there is the bomb—but there is also anesthesia.<br></p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>When it comes to viruses, the only tool we have to fight them is vaccination. The only tool. Antibiotics are for bacteria, a completely different sort of creature. Sanitation beyond personal hand-washing is ineffective. Vaccines trick the immune system into recognizing the virus earlier than it would otherwise and protect normal cells from invasion by the virus. Tricking the immune system is understandably problematic for people who believe that their body knows best if it’s just kept healthy. This virus, as we have seen from the array of infected people that includes apparently healthy folks, unfortunately does not subscribe to that belief.</p><p>By a similar sort of reasoning, some people make the plausible error of calculating that the vaccine is 95 percent effective but the survival rate is 99 percent, so why not just let my natural resistance take care of this? Indeed, that might not be unreasonable thinking if we were talking about the common cold, but this virus has shown itself to be a tricky character, and we are not yet able to predict who gets a serious case and who a mild one. With those sorts of stakes, you shouldn’t wager on either of those numbers because they have nothing to do with&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;as an individual. Like flipping a coin, there is only a 1 percent chance of it coming up heads 6 times in a row. But if it has come up heads 5 times in a row, the probability of it coming up heads on the next flip is…still 50/50.&nbsp;</p><p>An even larger unknown is whether there may be long-term effects associated with SARS-Cov-2, as is the case for many viruses. The 1918 influenza virus has been linked to a subsequent two-three fold increase in Parkinson’s disease by a mechanism we still don’t understand. The virus that gives children chicken pox will hide out in a person’s body for 40 years or more, and then emerge as a painful, sometimes debilitating, case of shingles. The 99 percent survivability rate of this virus is meaningless if, 20 years from now, it causes some devastating pulmonary or brain disease.</p><p>The main upside to vaccines is that because they use your already existing defense system, they are surprisingly safe. Safer than antibiotics, which have numerous side effects, because they are not part of our normal make up and are …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Protobuf needs no introduction, but this post argues that you shouldn’t use it for telemetry.
The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating.
Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. 
The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the <em>wire-format</em> itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.</p>

<h2 id="protobuf-java-is-a-little-heavy">Protobuf-java is a little heavy</h2>

<p>A few months ago I needed to become familiar with the Protobuf wire-format for a proof of concept.
The motivation for digging in to the wire-format, rather than just using <code>protobuf-java</code>, was the dimensions of the library, which I would need to bundle in an agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> <span>-c</span> %s protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar
1672950

<span>$ </span>jar <span>-tf</span> protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar | <span>grep</span> <span>'.class'</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
669
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just depending on the library adds 1.6MB and nearly 700 classes before you even generate your own message classes.
Since the deployment in question was an agent which can’t assume the presence of <code>protobuf-java</code> at runtime, there is no way to avoid bundling the extra 1.6MB.
Since the aforementioned agent implements <code>ClassLoader</code> isolation to avoid interfering with application class loading, even if <code>protobuf-java</code> <em>is</em> present at runtime, the classes would need to be loaded again by an isolated <code>ClassLoader</code>.</p>

<p>A tracer only needs to <em>produce</em> messages, so not all of those 669 classes (which doesn’t include your own generated classes) will get loaded, but a lot of them do.
Having since implemented library-neutral Protobuf serialisation in Datadog’s <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java">sketches-java</a>, I have a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java/blob/master/src/jmh/java/com/datadoghq/sketch/ddsketch/benchmarks/Serialize.java">point of comparison</a> to show how many classes get loaded in a write-only context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@OutputTimeUnit</span><span>(</span><span>TimeUnit</span><span>.</span><span>MICROSECONDS</span><span>)</span>
<span>@BenchmarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>Mode</span><span>.</span><span>AverageTime</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Serialize</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BuiltSketchState</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>serialize</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sketch</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>().</span><span>array</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>toProto</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>DDSketchProtoBinding</span><span>.</span><span>toProto</span><span>(</span><span>sketch</span><span>).</span><span>toByteArray</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since I mention a Datadog library and am a Datadog employee, I make clear that none of the opinions presented in this post or elsewhere on this blog represent those of my employer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each method produces identical bytes, and the purpose of the benchmark above is to compare speeds.
One of the methods relies on a single class consisting of fewer than 150 lines of code, including white-space, whereas the other depends on a large library.
For the record, the hand-written method <code>serialize</code> above is roughly 10x faster than using <code>protobuf-java</code>, but it’s not the point of this post. 
By running the benchmark for a single warmup iteration each, with the argument <code>-jvmArgsPrepend "-verbose:class"</code>, the classes which are loaded are logged, which I captured in separate files.
276 more classes are loaded when using <code>protobuf-java</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> serialize.log 
1400 serialize.log
<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> to_proto.log 
1676 to_proto.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you work at a large organisation which has entirely embraced Protobuf, I would not suggest worrying about 1.6MB or a few hundred loaded classes; these costs quickly amortise as you use the library for more features.
However, your resource budget for a diagnostic agent which tells you what your application is doing and how it’s performing should be tiny, and I’m not sure <code>protobuf-java</code> can be made to fit in to it, given the isolation constraints for agents outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="length-delimiters-are-costly-to-produce">Length delimiters are costly to produce</h2>

<p>This meant that I needed to write my own (which is a lot easier than it sounds if you haven’t done this sort of thing before) so I had to read the only documentation there is on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding</a>.
I couldn’t get the formatter I had written based on my first reading of this document to produce valid protobuf because I had skim-read the section on embedded messages, and because it includes a design decision that would never have occurred to me.
When I went back and read it again I was surprised to find that embedded messages are length-prefixed, but the length prefix is varint encoded, which means you don’t know how many bytes you need for the length until you’ve done the serialisation, and it’s recursive.</p>

<p>Length prefixes aren’t unusual in binary formats: BSON documents are prefixed by their sizes in bytes, meaning sub-documents need to be serialised recursively before their lengths can be written.
BSON makes this easy by not compressing the document length so you just leave 4 bytes for the length and come back and fill it in when popping document contexts (<a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/shrinking-bson-documents">it can add up to a significant portion of your database though</a>).
Msgpack, for example, <em>does</em> apply prefix compression of embedded element lengths (e.g. maps and arrays) but the length is an element count, not a number of bytes, which makes streaming serialisation a lot easier to do.</p>

<p>Protobuf does both, and, consequently, there’s no way to produce nested Protobuf messages without doing something relatively expensive.
You must either maintain a stack and copy contents from frame to frame as they are popped, or pre-compute serialised lengths of nested elements recursively; it isn’t possible to simply write serialised output sequentially to a stream as it is with other formats. 
I abandoned the proof of concept when I found that a streaming zero-allocation msgpack codec I had written was around 6x faster than either <code>protobuf-java</code> or a handwritten Protobuf codec for messages with nesting.
Since I couldn’t remove the nesting in the messages I needed to produce, I blamed the wire-format and moved on.</p>

<p>People who actually know Protobuf already know this (it’s literally written in the encoding manual), and understand the benefits which arise from this cost elsewhere (e.g. implementing partial deserialisation is easy, easy to skip over sections of the message), but lots of people don’t seem to understand the cost model the wire-format imposes.
If they did, there would probably be a lot less nesting in Protobuf as used in the wild.</p>

<p>This more or less concludes my argument against using Protobuf for telemetry: if you find for yourself that producing Protobuf messages is costly, it’s not even a case of a third party library making the wrong trade-offs for your application; it’s the wire-format itself at fault.
If you want to ship telemetry data out of an application and aim to minimise the impact on the application, even if you implement your own zero-allocation, micro-optimised codec, you shouldn’t choose Protobuf.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to segue into describing the wire-format for Protobuf 3, filling in a couple of the gaps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">Google’s encoding document</a>, but read the official document if you want to write your own.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-wire-format">Notes on the wire format</h2>

<p>Protobuf’s wire format is really simple: it’s just a list of tagged key-value pairs. 
Since readers have a schema to refer to, ambiguity is permissible and advantageous.
The logical structure of a Protobuf message is as below, with each tag followed by some bytes associated with the tag.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tag1:value1, tag3:value2, tag2:value3, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is a pseudo-Backus-Naur form of the wire format.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>body 	         ::= 	tagged_value*
tagged_value     ::=    tag value
tag              ::=    varint((field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type)
wire_type        ::=    VARINT | FIXED_64 | LENGTH_DELIMITED | GROUP_BEGIN | GROUP_END | FIXED_32
VARINT           ::=    0
FIXED_64         ::=    1
LENGTH_DELIMITED ::=    2
GROUP_BEGIN      ::=    3 (deprecated)
GROUP_END        ::=    4 (deprecated)
FIXED_32         ::=    5
value            ::=    varint | fixed_64 | length_delimited | fixed_32
fixed_64         ::=    double | long
length_delimited ::=    varint(N) byte{N}
fixed_32         ::=    float | int
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each data item has a tag, which contains the field number (as defined in the .proto file) and one of the four wire types still in use in Protobuf 3.
The tag is constructed by shifting the field number left by three bits and combining with the wire type, and then <em>varint-encoded</em> so it takes up less space.
Since there are only three bits for the wire type, there can only ever be eight wire types, and two have already been wasted on group begin and end markers (I don’t know the story behind these).
Given that <code>FIXED_32=5</code> with only two possible wire types left, I imagine that there were some tense meetings before deciding to add it.</p>

<p>The terminology above is my own, but notice that there are no terms like <code>repeated</code>, <code>oneof</code>, or <code>message</code>.
This is because they don’t exist at this level. 
<code>message</code> is just a length delimiter followed by some more protobuf, preceded by a <code>LENGTH_DELIMITED</code> tag; the schema has the necessary information to read the raw bytes.
<code>repeated</code> fields come in two kinds: packed and not packed. 
Packed <code>repeated</code> fields are indistinguishable from a <code>message</code> or a <code>string</code> on the wire.
<code>repeated</code> fields which aren’t packed are a list of tag-values with the same field number and the element type in each tag, and they don’t need to be contiguous within the message.
Incidentally, writers aren’t obliged not to repeat non-<code>repeated</code> fields, and as there is nothing to distinguish these fields over the wire, readers are obliged to take the <em>last value</em> for a non-<code>repeated</code> field (which makes some of the partial deserialisers I’ve seen illegal).</p>

<p><code>FIXED_32</code> corresponds to proto types <code>float</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>sfixed32</code>, whereas <code>FIXED_64</code> corresponds to <code>double</code>, <code>fixed64</code>, and <code>sfixed64</code>.
All other integers, which includes booleans, are <em>varint</em> encoded, which has the basic effect of removing leading zeros in order to save space.
Starting with the least significant bits, seven bits are taken at a time from the integer until no bits remain, and all but the last byte have their most significant bit set.
This allows the parser to detect the end of an integer by looking for a byte with the MSB unset. 
Whilst this saves space, it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, I work from home. This means my MacBook is constantly connected to the charger. For Lithium-Ion batteries, it's not healthy to remain charged at 100% all the time. I first noticed that there's a problem when my trackpad wasn't clicking properly anymore. Upon inspection with a ruler, I noticed that the keyboard was curved because the battery had swollen. To replace the swollen battery, the entire Topcase had to be replaced.</p>
<p>To avoid this from happening again, I started looking for a way to control the charging behavior of my MacBook.</p>
<p>In Mac OS Catalina 10.15.5, Apple has introduced a new feature called <code>Battery Health</code>. It is found under <code>System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver</code>. Apple describes the feature as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may reduce your battery's maximum charge when in this mode. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage-reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does that mean exactly? The description in the System Preferences is a bit clearer:</p>

<p>According to this message, OS X will start reducing the maximum charge of the battery when it ages, to extend its lifespan. In my tests, it drained the battery a bit after being plugged in for a while and then recharged it back to 100%. Since my battery health is still high, it didn't reduce the maximum charge even after being plugged in for multiple days.</p>
<p>This wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to control the maximum charge level myself before the battery was degraded. Lenovo and Tesla are both offering such a feature out of the box, Apple doesn't. Luckily there's a free tool that allows you to take control over the maximum charge level.</p>
<p> <strong>AlDente</strong> gives you the possibility to set a maximum charge level for your MacBook. The tool itself writes this value to the SMC of your MacBook. Most likely it's just using the same feature OS X is using, just more explicitly.</p>

<h2>How to install AlDente</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlDente's Github Page</a> and download the latest release. Then unzip the archive and move <code>AlDente.app</code> to your Applications folder.</p>
<p>Upon opening, you'll probably get a message like <code>AlDente cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>. To work around this, right-click on the application and click <code>Open</code>:</p>

<p>When you start AlDente for the first time, it will ask you to install its helper tool. This is required for AlDente to be able to write the SMC value as root.</p>
<p>Once the app is running, set the value to the maximum you desire. I would recommend a value between <strong>60 and 80 percent</strong> - I chose 70 percent as my sweet spot.</p>
<p>After that, you need to reboot to ensure the value is taken into account. If your battery is currently above your threshold, you'll have to unplug your MacBook, drain it below the threshold and then plug it back in. Once your defined maximum is reached, it will stop charging and display <code>Not Charging</code>.</p>

<h2>Compatible MacBooks</h2>
<p>This should work on every Intel MacBook running Catalina or higher. It is currently <strong>NOT</strong> supported on ARM-based MacBooks. I have successfully tested it on a <strong>2018 MacBook Pro 15"</strong> and a <strong>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</strong>. Based on information from the Github page, the following hardware is also confirmed working:</p>
<ul>
<li>2020 MacBook Pro 13" with 4 TB3 ports</li>
<li>2019 MacBook Pro 16"</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Pro 13" without TouchBar</li>
<li>2017 MacBook Air 13"</li>
<li>2013 MacBook Pro 13"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uninstalling AlDente</h2>
<p>To uninstall <code>AlDente</code>, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the maximum battery charge to 100%</li>
<li>Exit the application</li>
<li>Move the app to the trash</li>
<li>Remove the helper tool with the commands below</li>
<li>Reboot your MacBook</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove the helper tool, run the following commands in the Terminal:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>sudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.davidwernhart.Helper
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.davidwernhart.Helper.plist</code></pre></div>
<p><br>This should do the trick. If you want to be thorough, you can also <a href="https://nicam.dev/support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reset the SMC</a> after uninstalling it.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>
      Instead of simple dots, I wanted the list bullets of the index of <a href="https://blog.steren.fr&quot;/">my blog</a> to be the date at which articles were written. It turns out HTML+CSS can do that easily.
    <br>
      Here is how I created a list with custom bullets, taking their value from an HTML attribute.
    </p>

    <p>The HTML markup of my index page, note the <code>year="2020"</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;ol class="pages"&gt;
  &lt;li year="2020"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/my-article/"&gt;My article of 2020&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>And the CSS magic. we customize the bullet with <code>::marker</code> and read the HTML attribute with <code>attr()</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>.pages {
    padding-inline-start: 6ch;
  }

  .pages li::marker {
    content: attr(year) " - ";
  }</code></pre>

    <p>Here is how it displays:</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>The idea of this post is to introduce and discuss several interesting research programs from the past decade. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">research program</a> (or programme) refers to a common thread of research that shares similar assumptions, methodology, etc. The list below contains a variety of research programs: some on topics that have broad appeal e.g. <a href="#machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">explainable machine learning</a> and <a href="#the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">mental disorder</a>; others moved the direction of entire industries e.g. advances in <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">computer vision</a> and <a href="#blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>; and others still are more niche areas that I happen to be deeply interested in e.g. <a href="#topological-learning-theory">topological learning theory</a>, <a href="#privacy-attacks-on-machine-learning-models">privacy attacks on ML models</a>, and <a href="#the-graph-theoretic-approach-to-epistemic-justification">graph-theoretic approaches to epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, a list of this variety can never be complete and is surely biased by what I happen to be reading. If I’ve missed something interesting that you enjoy, let me know at <a href="mailto:brettcmullins@gmail.com">brettcmullins@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="image-recognition-and-object-detection">Image Recognition and Object Detection</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is difficult for me to begin this list without first talking about the area that most affected my professional career, led to (or at least accelerated) a boom in data science, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history">potentially thawed an AI winter</a>. During the 2010s, <a href="https://bmk.sh/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/">deep learning made enormous progress</a> in heuristics and applications. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a> in particular, a good starting point is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a> in 2012 which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> architecture to substantially surpass existing benchmarks for image recognition - the task of assigning a label such as <em>cat</em>, <em>dog</em>, or <em>tree</em> to an image - on the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a>. Over the next few years, improvements would continue with architectures such as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c">VGG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNet</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">Inception</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>With progress being made with recognition, other tasks such as object detection - finding and labeling objects (sometimes multiple objects) within images - became more feasible. One approach to object detection introduced in 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524">Regional CNNs (or R-CNNs)</a> combined a model that first produced promising bounding boxes then utilized the newly developed recognition models (starting with AlexNet) to classify or label the regions in the bounding boxes. Over the next few years, progress in this direction was realized with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Fast R-CNN</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Faster R-CNN</a>. These frameworks not only employed better recognition models and found better bounding boxes, but they integrated the model components together so that they could be more efficiently trained or tailored to one’s application. <a href="https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4">Here is an excellent overview</a> of these models with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>Accompanying these new techniques and improvements was a large amount of software - with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffe_(software)">Caffe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)">Torch</a> at first then the more user friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras">Keras</a> - allowing anyone to implement these models for their use cases. It’s also worth mentioning the proliferation of online courses such as <a href="https://fast.ai/">fast.ai’s</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> that facilitated getting potential users up to speed to test out and deploy these tools.</p>

<h2 id="topological-learning-theory">Topological Learning Theory</h2>
<hr>

<p>Topological Learning Theory is the mathematical study of the learnability/solvability of hypotheses/problems that is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">theory of computation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">descriptive set theory</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference">classical statistics</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory">statistical learning theory</a>). The idea of learning theory is to analyze the learnability of hypotheses as one incrementally receives information about the true state of the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3858127/pexels-photo-3858127.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" width="200" height="350"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#1.1">classic example</a> is to consider an ornithologist observing the color of ravens as, say, black or not. With each raven observed, the ornithologist gains information which rules out some hypotheses but is consistent with others. By coding a black raven as 1 and other ravens as 0, we can mathematically represent possible observation histories as infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, i.e. points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space">Cantor space</a>. The crux of this approach is that the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_11/Lecture_Notes/dst_lecture_notes_2011_lec_2.pdf">topology on the Cantor space and other such spaces</a> naturally <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/kelly/learnreview.pdf">encodes the idea of information accumulation</a>. By considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy">descriptive complexity of hypotheses</a>, identifying a hypothesis with the set of sequences that make it true, we can say things about the learnability of the hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis “all ravens are black” is the set containing the single sequence of all 1s. We say that this hypothesis is falsifiable since if there is a non-black raven our ornithologist will eventually observe it; however, it is verifiable not in finite time but in the limit since the hypothesis is never conclusively true after any finite number of observations. This corresponds to the topological notion of properly being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%CF%83_set">$F_{\sigma}$ or $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/kevin-kelly.html">Kevin Kelly’s</a> 1996 <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-logic-of-reliable-inquiry-9780195091953?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Logic of Reliable Inquiry</em></a> has been an authoritative text on formal learning theory in the Cantor space and other <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Polish+space">Polish spaces</a>. Advances in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computable+analysis">computable analysis</a> beginning in the early 2000s have enabled the extension of these classical formal learning theory results to a more general topological setting throughout the 2010s. The paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540109001631?via%3Dihub"><em>Topological Properties of Concept Spaces</em></a> from 2010 is the first to connect these computable analysis results to learning theory. By 2015, a pair of papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07518"><em>On the Solvability of Inductive Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/TARK2015-proceedings.pdf#page=119"><em>Theory Choice, Theory Change, and Inductive Truth-Conduciveness</em></a> - both presented at the <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/tark15.html">TARK 2015 conference</a> - provide complete topological characterizations of learnability/solvability in the limit as well as connections to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-belief-revision/">belief revision theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham’s Razor</a> in this more general topological setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">The Disordered Mind Theory of Mental Illness</h2>
<hr>

<p>In a series of articles and books over the past decade, the philosopher <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/george-graham">George Graham</a> develops a theory of mental disorder with the following qualities: 1. is non-reductionist with respect to the mind and the brain; 2. is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a>; and 3. coheres with the experiences of patients and clinicians. Graham’s theory holds that mental illness is distinct from somatic/bodily illness though may co-occur or otherwise be bound up with so-called <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07609-001">broken brains</a>. A helpful analogy for what is meant here by “the mental” or “the mind” is to view the brain as computer hardware, whereas the mind is software. On this picture, the mind and the brain are surely not independent; a hardware issue may impede the computation of some software. However, one may have bugs in one’s software - “gumming up the works” to use a common phrase of Graham - on perfectly functioning hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978036732/9780367322328.jpg" width="200" height="280"></p>

<p>This theory of mental disorder is developed in Graham’s text on mental illness in the context of the philosophy of mind: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Disordered-Mind/Graham/p/book/9780367322328"><em>The Disordered Mind</em></a>. A follow-up book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-abraham-dilemma-9780198728658?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Abraham Dilemma</em></a>, refines this theory for the case of delusion, religious delusion in particular (I discuss <em>The Abraham Dilemma</em> in greater detail in my <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/top-books-2020/#the-abraham-dilemma-a-divine-delusion">Top Books in 2020</a>). Graham’s latest book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/hearing-voices-and-other-matters-of-the-mind-9780190091149?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind</em></a> explores the unique properties and challenges of mental disorders in the presence of religious content. The disordered mind theory <a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-disordered-mind-an-introduction-to-philosophy-of-mind-and-mental-illness/">is not without its detractors</a> who hold that Graham goes too far in arguing that one need not situate and commit to positions in the philosophy of mind to reject the complete reduction of mental illness to neuroscience.</p>

<p>I took George Graham’s seminar on Philosophy and Mental Illness in 2014 at <a href="https://philosophy.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> and had several interesting chats with him about the metaphysics and definability of mental disorders.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">Machine Learning Interpretability and Explainability</h2>
<hr>

<p>The boom in data science and widespread use of machine learning models during the past decade was accelerated by innovations in model architectures as well as tools and software to train and deploy these models. In addition to the <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">progress with neural networks and deep learning</a>, algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost">XGBoost</a> allowed users to achieve state-of-the-art classification and regression performance without much effort. XGBoost in particular became so prevalent in both industry and ML competitions - as had logistic regression and other GLMs in the past - that it was not unreasonable for some to wonder whether or not <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d">we should just use XGBoost all the time</a>.</p>

<p>For all that these models gained in performance, they lost ground in being able to provide answers to questions from stakeholders, developers, and so forth when things went wrong as to why a model’s prediction was so far off or why does the computer vision model <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">think a banana is a toaster</a>. Two approaches were offered as a solution (three if you count “Who cares?! Let’s do nothing!”): interpretability and explanations. The former offers constraints on model building such as limiting the number of features used and restricting to linear models so that the model is sufficiently simple to allow the developer/user to reliably predict the model’s behavior with a reasonable amount of effort. The latter is a set of methods for generating reasons for a model’s behavior for arbitrarily complex models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490"><em>The Mythos of Model Interpretability</em></a> is an early effort to disentangle these terms and map the landscape for understanding models. Also see <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_blackboxes/">my attempt here</a> as well as Christoph Molnar’s ever-evolving text <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a>.</p>

<p><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://bcmullins.github.io/images/blog/best_articles_2018/anchor.png"></p>

<p>The approach that I find the most compelling stems from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME paper</a>. LIME (or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) is a method of generating an interpretable, i.e. linear, approximation of a model in the neighborhood of a given point in the feature space. This new model is then used to generate explanations by virtue of its interpretability. A second approach for classifiers called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a> - both are developed by the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/group.html">same research group at UW</a> that also developed XGBoost - produces a simple region of the feature space (a rectangle) where the model’s prediction holds with high probability for a given point. This region or anchor acts as a sort of sufficiency condition for classification. The image to the right illustrates these ideas with the dotted line being a local linear approximation and the …</p></div></div>

    <p>Google AI recently released a paper, <em>Rethinking Attention with Performers</em>
<a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>, which introduces <em>Performer</em>, a Transformer
architecture which estimates the full-rank-attention mechanism using orthogonal
random features to approximate the softmax kernel with linear space and time
complexity. In this post we will investigate how this works, and how it is
useful for the machine learning community.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-kernel-trick">The Kernel Trick</h2>

<p>Before we talk about Attention, it is important to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method#Mathematics:_the_kernel_trick">kernel
trick</a>.
Gregory Gundersen gives a great explanation on his
<a href="http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/12/10/kernel-trick/">blog</a>, but we will go over a
brief summary here. This section is not completely necessary for understanding
<em>Performers</em>, but might provide some helpful context.</p>

<p>Say we have some data $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/circles.png" alt="circles"></p>

<p>We can see that this data is not linearly separable, i.e. if we wanted to fit a
logistic regression or linear support vector machine (SVM) to the data we
wouldn’t be able to. How do we get around this? We can map the data into a
higher dimension, say $\mathbb{R}^3$, using a function 
$\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^3$:</p><p>

\[\varphi \left(\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} \right)
 = \begin{bmatrix} x_1^2 \\ x_2^2 \\ \sqrt{2}x_1 x_2 \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>This function $\varphi$ is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel">polynomial
kernel</a> of degree $d=2$. If we
apply it to our data, $x$, we can visualize that it becomes linearly separable:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/poly_circles.png" alt="poly circles"></p>

<p>Now we can recall the expression for fitting a linear SVM:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j})\]

</p><p>Don’t worry if this expression is unfamiliar, just note that we are computing a
dot product between two samples $\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j}$, and repeating
this process many times.
If we want to use our kernel function $\varphi$ so that the data is linearly seperable,
we can simple wrap each $x_n$ with $\varphi$ to map it into a higher dimension:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)})\]

</p><p>Now we could stop here, but we can make this more efficient. What we have so far
requires computing $\varphi(x_n)$, $N$ times, and the dot-product
$\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)$, $N^2$ times, which could start becoming very
computationally expensive, especially with kernel functions that map to very
high dimensions. How do we get around this? This is where the <strong>kernel trick</strong> comes
in. Suppose we had a function $K : \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$
where:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>If we can find a $K$ that performs this operation in a lower dimensional space,
we can save potentially great amounts of compute. For the polynomial kernel
$\varphi$ defined above, finding $K$ is fairly straight forward (derivation is
left as an exercise to the reader):</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i^\top x_j)^2 = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>We are now doing the dot-product in lower dimensional space, but we will get the
same result as performing the dot-product after the projection. This means we
can rewrite our linear SVM expression one more time:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j \textcolor{blue}{K(x_i, x_j)}\]

</p><p>Now instead of doing a dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we are doing it in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. This might not make much of an impact in terms of computational
cost in this case, but it can make a much bigger difference with more complex
kernel functions and higher dimensional data. Next, we will see how <strong>Random
Fourier Features</strong> can reduce the computational cost of some kernel functions <em>even more</em>.</p>

<h2 id="random-fourier-features">Random Fourier Features</h2>

<p>In <em>Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines</em> <a href="#rahimi2007random">(Rahimi &amp; Recht, 2007)</a>
(which won the NIPS “Test of Time” award in 2017, ten years after it was
published), they set out to approximate $K$ using a randomized feature map 
$z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p>Specifically, they prove theoretically that the Gaussian or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel">RBF
kernel</a>:</p><p>

\[K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(-\gamma \lVert x_i - x_j \rVert^2)\]

</p><p>Can be approximated by sampling $z$ from the Fourier transformation. Concretely,
one way we can write this as is:</p><p>

\[z_\omega(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_ R(0, I) $ is sampled from a spherical Gaussian.
With this approximation, the dot-product no longer needs to be performed in
$\mathbb{R}^L$ space, it can now be performed in $\mathbb{R}^R$ space, where
$R \ll L$. How is this useful? <strong>Using Random Fourier Features, we can
approximate any function $K$ that can be written in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$.</strong></p>

<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://teddykoker.com/2020/02/nlp-from-scratch-annotated-attention/">previous blog post</a>, we went over
the <em>self-attention</em> mechanism, an how it was introduced for language
translation. Nowadays, most language models use <em>scaled-dot-product attention</em> as
defined in the <em>Transformers</em> paper <a href="#vaswani2017attention">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</a>:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) =
\text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right) V\]

</p><p>Where $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$, $L$ is the sequence length, and $d$
is some hidden dimension. We can expand the $\text{softmax}$ and rewrite
the expression as the following:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = D^{-1}AV, \quad
A = \exp(QK^\top/\sqrt{d}), \quad
D = \text{diag}(A 1_L)\]

</p><p>Where $1_L$ is a vector of ones of length $L$. In Python this looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>attention</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>):</span>
    <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>q</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>q</span> <span>@</span> <span>k</span><span>.</span><span>T</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>**</span> <span>-</span><span>0.5</span><span>))</span>
    <span>d_inv</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>diag</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>@</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ones</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>d_inv</span> <span>@</span> <span>a</span> <span>@</span> <span>v</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This $\text{Attention}$ method has some limitations however; if we
examine the attention matrix, $A$, we will realize it is of shape $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, meaning that any operation performed with $A$ will have a time
and space complexity that grows <strong>quadratically</strong> with respect to the sequence
length $L$. This puts a limitation on the maximum sequence length that can be
used with the Transformer, which means they are not usable for many tasks that
may require much longer sequence lengths, such as dialog, protein sequences, and
images.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, many have developed their own “X-former” to
reduce this complexity, and this is becoming a growing area of research; for a
full survey see <a href="#tay2020efficient">(Tay et al., 2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performer">Performer</h2>

<h3 id="softmax-kernel">Softmax Kernel</h3>

<p>The <em>Performer</em> <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>  seeks to reduce the
complexity of Attention using random Fourier features. Using the equation above,
we can factor out the normalization component, $\sqrt{d}$, in the
computation of $A$:</p><p>

\[A = \exp \left(
\frac{Q}{\sqrt[4]{d}}
\left( \frac{K}{\sqrt[4]{d}} \right)^\top
\right)\]

</p><p>As we continue, we will assume that this normalization is applied beforehand, so
we can rewrite as simply:</p><p>

\[A = \exp(QK^\top)\]

</p><p>Now lets say we define a softmax kernel, $K_\text{softmax} : \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ as:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(x_i^\top x_j)\]

</p><p>Using this softmax kernel, we can rewrite the computation of any element within
$A$:</p><p>

\[A(i, j) = K_\text{softmax}(q_i^\top,k_j^\top)\]

</p><p>Where $q_i$, $k_j$, represent the $i^\text{th}$,
$j^\text{th}$ row vector in $Q$, $K$, respectively.</p>

<p>Since the attention matrix is now written as the output of a kernel function $K_\text{softmax}$,
we could potentially approximate it at a <strong>lower dimensionality</strong> as we did for the Gaussian kernel above
feature mapping $z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K_{softmax}(x_i, x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p><em>Note: <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a> uses $\varphi$ to denote this random
feature mapping, I am using $z$ for consistency.</em> Working from the definition of
the Gaussian kernel function, we can derive $K_\text{softmax}$
in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) =
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_i \rVert^2}{2} \right)
K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j)
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_j \rVert^2}{2} \right)\]

</p><p>See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for full derivation. With this derivation, we can
come up with our random feature mapping $z_\omega$ that approximates
the $K_\text{softmax}$ kernel using the Random Fourier features approximation of
the Gaussian kernel:</p><p>

\[z_\omega^\text{sin/cos}(x) = 
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x \rVert^2}{2} \right)
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where, again, $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_R(0, I)$ is sampled from a spherical
Gaussian. <strong>Now, instead of our attention matrix $A$ being of size $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, it is only of size $\mathbb{R}^{R \times L}$, with the sum of each
row approximating that of it’s full-rank counterpart.</strong></p>

<p>This looks quite complex at this point, but we can now write the full
approximated attention mechanism, $\widehat{\text{Attention}}(Q, K, V)$, in Python like so:</p>

<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies that law enforcement may use at protests and other public gathering to spying on people exercising their fundamental rights. Learn how to spot the surveillance so you can advocate effectively for the policies necessary to protect your rights and bring transparency to the police surveillance.</p>

<p>If you attend a protest, demonstration or any mass gathering in a public space, the police are probably surveilling you. Whether it’s sophisticated facial recognition, ubiquitous video recording, or the instant analysis of our biometric data, law enforcement agencies are following closely behind their counterparts in the military and intelligence services in acquiring privacy-invasive technologies, from automated license plate readers to body-worn cameras to drones and more.  In this talk, Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies in use:
<br>	• Where to look for these devices
<br>	• How these technologies look
<br>	• How these technologies function
<br>	• How they are used by police
<br>	• What kind of data they collect
<br>	• Where to learn more about them
<br>Knowledge is power. Knowing what technologies are in use can help you understand the threats to your privacy and security, as well as tools to advocate for limits on police use of surveillance that may chill people’s rights to express themselves on public issues.  Just as analog surveillance historically has been used as a tool for oppression, policymakers and the public must understand the threat posed by emerging technologies to successfully defend human rights in the digital age. </p>

<p>This talk will be about FPMON, a browser extension that shows you where, when and which browser fingerprinting method is applied against you. You can use it to test your favorite websites and check your own services for 3rd-party fingerprinting scripts. It can also be used to test various browser privacy tools.</p>

<p>Tracking users is a ubiquitous practice in the web today. User activity is recorded on a large scale and analyzed by various actors to create personalized products, forecast future behavior, and prevent online fraud. While so far HTTP cookies have been the weapon of choice, new and more pervasive techniques such as browser fingerprinting are gaining traction. Hence, in this talk, we describe how users can be empowered against fingerprinting by showing them when, how, and who is tracking them using JavaScript fingerprinting. To this end, we conduct a systematic analysis of various fingerprinting tools. Based on this analysis, we design and develop FPMON: a light-weight and comprehensive fingerprinting monitor that measures and rates JavaScript fingerprinting activity on any given website in real-time. Using FPMON, we evaluate the 10k most popular websites to i) study the pervasiveness of JavaScript fingerprinting; ii) review the latest fingerprinting countermeasures; and iii) identify the major networks that foster the use of fingerprinting. Our evaluations reveal that i) fingerprinters are present on many popular websites with sensitive contents (finance, news, NGOs, health, etc.); ii) they run without user consent and subvert current privacy regulations; and iii) most countermeasures can not sufficiently protect users.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=473">‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’</a> by Donald Knuth from 2001. Recommended reading if you like reading about how a world-renowned computer scientist wrote a book about how he wrote a book that deals with another book! Sounds recursive 😏</p>



<p>That last book is of course the bible and the book Knuth wrote about it is <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=1">‘3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated ‘</a> — published in 1991. And in 1999 Knuth gave <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">a series of lectures at MIT</a> <em>‘on the general subject of relations between faith and science’.</em> In these lectures he explains how he went about writing this book and the thought process involved. So the lectures make for an enjoyable deep dive on creating such a book and how Knuth’s brain works, paired with discussions and insights on religion and things like eternity and finiteness.</p>



<p>And it is this series of lectures that are bundled together in ‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’ — almost verbatim. But, the lectures have also always been available as audio files (sadly no visuals) on <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">Knuth’s homepage</a>. And I listened to those a few years back, and as I read this book I was reminded that I had created a RSS feed for these files, <strong>effectively creating a Knuth podcast!</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml"><img loading="lazy" src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.jpeg 1550w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>This is a later picture of Donald Knuth and not from the 1999 lectures. I added the text, of course in the <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern">only possible font</a>.<br>(I have no copyright on this picture and couldn’t find out who did actually. Feel free to drop me a line if I can accredit you, or if you want it changed.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I mostly created the file for myself to have the convenience of listening to the lectures in a podcast player. But I have also dropped the link to the XML file <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21967785">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19688748">there</a> over the years, and I noticed 607 <strong>unique</strong> IP addresses hit this link this month alone! There are only six lectures and one panel discussion and never any new content, so I am not sure what these numbers mean, if they mean anything at all. </p>



<p>But I also remembered I had never blogged about this, until now. So without further ado here is the link: </p>



<p><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml">https://j11g.com/knuth.xml</a></p>



<p>You can add this to your favorite podcast player. I have added the feed to Overcast myself so <a href="https://piks.nl/upload/upload/_pn_2020-12-29_11-02-22.png">it looks like this</a> which is nice.</p>



<p>Having the audiofiles available in a podcast player enables you to track progress, speed up/down parts and have an <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/1223317202478211076">enhanced</a> audio experience.</p>



<p>I do remember writing an email (<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">no hyphen</a>) to Knuth’s office and I received a nice reply that they thought it was <em>‘a great idea’</em>, and they were actually also thinking of starting their own podcast ‘<em>based on these materials’</em>. However I haven’t found any link to this yet, so for now it is just this.</p>



<p>If you are more into video, here is a great conversation Donald Knuth had with Lex Fridman last year. Published exactly a year ago to this day. The video is not embeddable but  you can click the image to go there. Recommended.</p>

December 30, 2020 | https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The triggers discussed in this post are powerful levers to influence peoples decision making processes. Never ever abuse this knowledge. Apply it in ethical ways and call out unethical usage when you spot it in the wild.</p>
<p>Your Landing Page is finally live and the metrics are promising but your conversion rates are still a little bit behind? It seems like there's some interest in your product but for some reason people aren't convinced enough to click that call-to-action.</p>
<p>Maybe you're running an ecommerce store and sales are great. But aren't there any tweaks you can apply to increase your sales even further?</p>
<p>Sometimes all that's necessary is a little nudge. In this blog post we'll examine what that nudge might be. How you can drive more attention towards action-taking rather than closing the browser tab and moving on. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Human needs</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is by no means a scientific write-up. If you're interested in the fascinating topic of Psychology I'd encourage you to pick up some legit literature such as "Thinking Fast and Slow" or to connect with an expert who majored in Psychology.</p>
<p>Before jumping right into the triggers, let's take a step back and understand why knowing the basics of human psychology is such an important and fascinating skill to possess.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything we do on a day-to-day is somehow influenced by our unconscious, the part of our being we cannot directly control. One of the many sources of information that has formed and still informs our unconscious is the basics of human behavior and desires. At the core, humans are very social beings. Forming tribes helped us survive and thrive in uncertain times. It's important for us to show that we're worthy being part of the tribe. Being an outsider by taking unapproved actions put oneself at huge risks and disadvantages. Risks that usually translated into pain and death. As it turned out, it made a whole lot of sense to play by the rules and adhere to the consensus.</p>
<p>Times have changed and nowadays there's a lot less risk involved when making decisions. However the tribal thinking is still deeply rooted in ourselves and therefore influences the actions we take.</p>
<p>Do you study reviews before buying products online? Do you browse through the comments on a YouTube video? Both of those actions are driven by the fact that we want to see what our peers are thinking and how they might think about us when we buy the item in question or like the videos content.</p>
<h2>The Triggers</h2>
<p>Now that we learned more about basic human needs and what drives us, it's time to take a deep dive into the different Psychological Triggers you can use to tap into those needs and nudge your visitors to take certain actions.</p>
<h3>1. Me vs. You</h3>
<p>To some extent, everyone is an egoist. While that might sound harsh it's a reality that people are obsessed with themselves. Knowing this puts you at a huge advantage because you can articulate your copywriting in a way that speaks directly to your users "self".</p>
<p>Don't talk about your company, the achievements and prizes you won. Don't write a wall of text outlining every single feature your product offers. Your company is in the business since the late 90s? Your app has a "dark mode"? That's all great but <strong>nobody really cares</strong>!</p>
<p>What matters are the benefits your users will experience when using your product. What are they dreaming about? What pain does your product address? How does your product help them live a better life? That's all that matters.</p>
<p>Update your copywriting to talk directly to your users rather than about you. Paint a picture of their dream and how your product helps them turn that dream into a reality.</p>
<h3>2. Making Progress</h3>
<p>There are only 9 pages left to complete the chapter in your favorite book? You only have to collect one more item to reach the next level in your favorite video game?</p>
<p>People love to make progress. It just feels good to take a project all the way from 0% to 100%. Even better if the progress is visualized and you can see the progress bar increasing with every little step of the way.</p>
<p>Use this love for progress in your products and services. Do you have a time-consuming onboarding process? Break it up into individual pieces and show a progress bar at the top of the page which updates as your users fill out the forms. Are you looking for more Newsletter sign ups? Display a "50% done" progress bar at the top of your Newsletter Form and call out that your visitor is "almost there".</p>
<p>Whenever you're looking for more commitment from your users, break the task down into individual pieces and add some information which makes it clear as to what the current status is and what is necessary to make progress.</p>
<h3>3. Time</h3>
<p>Time is one of the resources which cannot be created. Time will move on, no matter what you do. Given this, everyone values their time more than anything else.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways you can work with the "Time trigger".</p>
<p>The first one being to call out how much your product will help your users save time. Do you automate a time-consuming process? Do the math and clearly show your users how much time they'll save when they use your app. Time they can spend with their significant other or kids (you want to call that out as well).</p>
<p>Another usage of the "Time trigger" can often be found in conjunction with scarcity. "25% for the next 24 hours", "Registrations only open today". Those are the phrases you'll usually find on ecommerce stores or online course websites. You can do the same and offer time-bound discounts. If you do so, please make sure that your offer is legit. Use time and scarcity in a dishonest way and you'll immediately lose trust.</p>
<h3>4. Comparing and Contrasting</h3>
<p>The "Basic Plan" is 99 USD while the "Pro Plan" which has significantly more features is only 129 USD? Most people would pick the "Pro Plan" given that it has more features to offer. Even if those features will never be used. Looking at it through the lens of logic it doesn't really make sense to go with the "Pro Plan" if the "Basic Plan" would be more than enough in terms of value delivered.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it's not about what the product is, it's about what it stands next to. You can use this fact to steer the decision making process in the direction of your liking. Make it easy for your users to compare and contrast different offerings. Even if you don't plan to sell a cheaper option, offer it anyway and put it next to the one which is slightly more expensive but more feature rich. You'd be amazed to see that most of your users will go with the more expensive option even if they'll never user all the features it offers.</p>
<h3>5. Fear</h3>
<p>A huge major driving force which is ingrained in everyone of us is fear. Fear comes in many different forms. We're fearful of failure, bad things happening to our loved ones and the inevitable death.</p>
<p>Another form of fear is the "fear of missing out" a.k.a FOMO. Always being in the known gives us huge advantages and an edge over our competition. Missing out on a major new trend or business opportunity could have detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>You can trigger the "fear of missing out" by subtly talking about the possibility of missing out on a huge opportunity when passing on your offering.</p>
<p>A prime example which shows this in action are travel booking websites. Remember that "12 people have visited this listing in the last 6 hours" notification on the hotel website. You don't want to be the person who misses out on this great deal!</p>
<h3>6. Social Proof</h3>
<p>As we already learned, us humans are social animals. Being social doesn't only mean that we like to socialize with each other, it also means that we tend to mimic and "copy" one another to be more likeable and therefore accepted in our peer group.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy something but you're not sure which option to go with? It might be a good idea to study the testimonials, reviews and ratings to make a more informed decision. The new Todo-app you just discovered looks quite compelling but why bother given that you're already using the stock Todo-app on your phone? As it turns out, at least a handful of Fortune 500 companies and Silicon Valley juggernauts are using it in their day-to-day so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>You want to be a part of your tribe so naturally you're looking at what your peers are doing. This is what "Social Proof" is all about. Showing that you're about to make the right decision because peers in your tribe did the same.</p>
<p>Do you already have happy customers using your app? Take some time to conduct some interviews and translate those into testimonials you can put on your Landing Page. Maybe you have some large enterprises using your product. Write some Case Studies to show what value your product offers. There are entire software applications you can use to display social proof widgets on your homepage or ecommerce store ("Someone in New York bought this item 2 hours ago").</p>
<h3>7. Acting logical</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to believe that all the decisions she makes are entirely driven by logic. As it turns out this is not true most of the time. You and I buy products based on emotion rather than logic. Just pay close attention to the advertisements you see every day. Almost every single one speaks in the language of emotions rather than logic.</p>
<p>But once the decision has been made and the purchase is done we tend to justify our actions based on logic. "I bought the car because there was a discount and a friend of mine knows the car dealership owner. Furthermore I get the first service for free and it's also an older model so it's cheaper than buying a brand new one. ...". Observe yourself and others and you'll notice that all of us try to retroactively fit our decision making into logical bits and pieces. Even if it sometime results in contradictions and lies.</p>
<p>What you want to do is to supply additional information about your product which helps your users justify the purchase in a logical manner. Have a dedicated "Features" page which lists out all the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am pretty much a knowledge addict.</p>
<p>I use Twitter, RSS, and numerous other mediums of information — from Telegram channels to standalone blogs.</p>
<p>Out of a thousand articles a hundred gets skimmed through. A few dozens make it to my "Read Later" list, and only a fraction I find worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>These worthy ones end up in <a href="https://drobinin.com/newsletter/">my weekly newsletter, the Tuesday Triage</a>, where I comment on the most intriguing articles I've read and share facts I learnt over the week.</p>
<p>Some of those trivia are not trivial at all, so I decided to condense this <em>crème de la crème of the Internet</em> in a subjective list of the best ones in no particular order.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="solresol"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol">Solresol</a> <a href="#solresol">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people know about the esperanto, an artificially created language. Way less people are aware of Solresol, another artificial language, built upon the musical grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your health good? - Redofafa?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the countryside this year? - Fadoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the theatre tonight? - Soldoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Sol-resol.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="logbook"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbook</a> <a href="#logbook">¶</a></h4>
<p>As developers we work with logs a lot. And the logs are stored in logbooks (or at least they were). What's the ethymology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how come a chip log was used to estimate a ship's speed? In the absence of GPS and without any visible clues about the speed of a ship in the open water, sailors started to throw wooden pieces with a tied strope (hence the definition of knots as nautical miles per hour!) into water and then measure the relative speed against such logs, hence the name.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="popcorn-in-the-1800s"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn#Consumption">Popcorn in the 1800s</a> <a href="#popcorn-in-the-1800s">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't surprise me when I think about this as a dish, and yet I'd probably never come up with that on my own.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="danakil-depression"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danakil_Depression">Danakil Depression</a> <a href="#danakil-depression">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Danakil Depression is the northern part of the Afar Triangle or Afar Depression in Ethiopia, a geological depression that has resulted from the divergence of three tectonic plates in the Horn of Africa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3682/10387154385_32f2fdb136_b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ansi-k-100.1-1974"><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6140/K100.1-1974%20-%20American%20National%20Standard%20Safety%20Code%20%26%20Requirements%20for%20Dry%20Martinis%20.pdf">ANSI K 100.1-1974</a> <a href="#ansi-k-100.1-1974">¶</a></h4>
<p>The year is 1974. The American National Standards Institute introduces safety code and requirements for dry martinis, and boy-oh-boy are they good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p><em>Gibson.</em><br>
An unpardonable form of perversion. See onion soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test Methods</p>
<p>[...] In testing, the taster shall watch for lightness of color, absence of sediment, a delicate aroma that effectively combines the scent of the juniper with the herbal infusion in the vermouth, a taste that is both sharp and clean with a faint body, and a light delicate aftertaste.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4 id="by-the-bye"><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/57078/by-the-bye-etymology-and-usage">By the bye</a> <a href="#by-the-bye">¶</a></h4>
<p>This example left me, to put it succinctly, flabbergasted for a brief moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>by the by or by the bye : INCIDENTALLY [defined as "by way of interjection or digression : by the way"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if it will help me to up the game of interrupting folks in conversations.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pie-barm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">Pie Barm</a> <a href="#pie-barm">¶</a></h4>
<p>Watch after my hands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ferment a liquid (beer, wine, or stock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take the foam from the top of the liquid (this is called <strong>barm</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use this foam to leaven a bread roll, and then put something inside it (now this is called a <strong>barm cake</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we do all of that in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, we most likely would put a pie as a filling (they also host the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-46620294/world-pie-eating-champion-crowned-in-wigan">World Pie Eating Championship</a>, so no surprise). And here it is, the pie barm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wigan, a whole savoury pie is served in a barm cake, known locally as a "Wigan Kebab".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/random-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5813a857-4338-41ec-a2db-d751d986268c.jpeg?resize=878%2C659&amp;ssl=1" alt="The image by https://random-times.com/2020/04/24/pie-barm-an-unconventional-traditional-sandwich-from-wigan-england/"></p><hr>
<h4 id="two-spaces-after-period"><a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/">Two spaces after period</a> <a href="#two-spaces-after-period">¶</a></h4>
<p>Back then people had to put two spaces after punctuation marks as typewriters had monospaced typesetting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why: Back when we used typewriters, every character was given the exact same amount of space on the page. That meant the letter i was given the same amount of space as the letter m, even though it clearly didn’t need it. This is called monospaced typesetting and it’s, well, spacey. We needed that extra space between sentences to make it easier to see the beginning of new sentences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days quite a few still do that; usually one can easily assume they've learnt to type not on a computer.</p>
<p>Rarely, one encounters someone like me, with a typewriter next to the keyboard, and just thinks I am stupid and don't know thine grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="erstwhile"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile">erstwhile</a> <a href="#erstwhile">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a beautiful word I unearthed recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverb erstwhile has been part of English since the 16th century, but it is formed from two words that are much older. It comes from the Old English words ær, meaning "early", and hwīl, which has much the same meaning as the modern word while. (The English word ere, meaning "before," is also descendant of ær.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as a synonim to "former", e.g "erstwhile enemies".</p>

<h4 id="children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail"><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-children-sent-through-mail-180959372/">Children used to be sent through the Mail</a> <a href="#children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am just surprised that this practice was eventually banned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia. According to Lynch, Baby James was just shy of the 11-pound weight limit for packages sent via Parcel Post, and his “delivery” cost his parents only 15 cents in postage (although they did insure him for $50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postage was cheaper than train tickets back then (and still is, actually), so I can't really blame the parents.</p>

<h4 id="ek-number"><a href="https://digg.com/2018/how-different-countries-laugh-online">ek number</a> <a href="#ek-number">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I realize that speaking in one (two, three, ...) languages means there are corners of the Internet and/or world you can't appreciate, in the first place because you can't understand them.</p>
<p>So while knowing both English and Russian is usually more than enough to find an answer to almost any question, I still miss the jewels like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ek number," which loosely translates to "I rate this number one" — the "ek" itself means "one" in Hindi — is commonly used as an affirmative response to a joke. If you find something to be funny, you could always type "haha" or "hehe" in India, but you can also signal your enjoyment by responding "ek number."</p>

<p>Chocolate chips have a water drop's shape because it's easier to make that way. It's harder to use though.</p>
<p>Remy Labesque, one of Tesla's designers, helped Dandelion Chocolate to invent a machine to make ideal chocolate chips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of a typical store-bought chocolate chip is an arbitrary result of the industrial manufacturing process used to make it. As you might expect, a drop of molten chocolate is deposited onto a flat surface and left to cool. Chocolate chip taste varies widely by brand, but the shape of the chips does not.</p>
<p>The shape of our chip is faceted: The edges of a Dandelion Chocolate chip taper to thin-as-we could-make-’em without compromising structure. This is because the thermal mass of a thin piece of chocolate melts more quickly on the palate. So when you put a Dandelion chip on your tongue, the thin, chiseled edges warm-to-melt nearly instantly.</p>

<p>1 lb of these chips costs 30$, not bad.</p>

<h4 id="ogden's-basic-english"><a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/">Ogden's Basic English</a> <a href="#ogden's-basic-english">¶</a></h4>
<p>Apparently removing all redundancies, synonims, etc from the English language leaves us only with 850 words or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this simplified language Basic English, the developer is Charles K. Ogden, and was released in 1930 with the book: Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar. He founded the Orthological Institute to develop the tools for teaching Basic English. His most famous associate, I.A. Richards, led the effort in the Orient, which uses the techniques to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting bit is, that change doesn't affect the grammar, so one could learn only 850 words and yet converse in English by using its grammar to its full extent.</p>

<h4 id="brick-pencil"><a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Brick pencil</a> <a href="#brick-pencil">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>, one of the people behind the creation of a computer mouse, and then graphical interfaces, argued about interfaces in his paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: a Conceptual Framework" in 1962 and to proof his point came up with a brick pencil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/images/augment-3906/fig2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>(and now users complain that they have to click a button twice; such a shame)</p>

<h4 id="cosmic-latte"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte">Cosmic Latte</a> <a href="#cosmic-latte">¶</a></h4>
<p>Wikipedia sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cosmic latte is the average colour of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those keen on putting this into their apps, here is the colour: #FFF8E7.</p>

<h4 id="7-up's-history"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up#History">7-UP's history</a> <a href="#7-up's-history">¶</a></h4>
<p>In my childhood I used to love 7-UP a lot, mostly because it was nearly transparent hence felt less poisonous comparing to other sodas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably if I were to drink it until 1948 it'd be my favourite drink anyway, but not because of its (lack of) colour.</p>
<p>Also all myths about its name are hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, making it acidic on the pH scale and similar to other drinks of this type. [...]<br>
The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this one makes the most sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Britvic also claims that the name is a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.jthoenes.net/personal-retrospectives/">previous articles</a>&nbsp;I wrote, that when doing your very own Personal Retrospective, it has to be in your personal way. But you may have asked yourself how it can work for you. To give you some ideas, I’ll share the approaches of three different people: Linda Rising, Ilias Bartolini and myself.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/iStock_000021086344XSmall-300x199.jpg" alt="article-image"></p>

<p>A retrospective has to be “tailor made” as Derby and Larsen [<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dlret/agile-retrospectives">1</a>] point out. This is in my opinion even more important for personal retrospectives. They need to fit to your thinking, your needs and your timetable. However, it is good to start with something - and over time adapt it to your own needs. I have done this, and probably everyone doing personal retrospectives is doing it.</p>

<p>So here are three approaches you can derive and mix and match from.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Write, Re-Write and Read Retrospective Notes - Linda Rising</h2>

<p>For Linda Rising[<a href="http://www.lindarising.org/">2</a>], a well-known retrospective facilitator,&nbsp;personal retrospectives are an important tool, to know about herself. She writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The cognitive psychologists tell us that it’s difficult, perhaps impossible, to&nbsp;really know ourselves and why we make the decisions in our lives. Our only&nbsp;hope, it seems to me, is to use some of the same techniques that we use&nbsp;to discover what teams have done well, what they might think about doing
differently, and what still puzzles them :-)!</p></blockquote>

<p>After finishing an activity she thinks she might do again, she will think about that activity and note her thoughts on paper. She usually does this right after finishing the activity while traveling.&nbsp;When she arrives at home, she will type the notes and safe them into a folder called <em>“Retrospective”.</em></p>

<p>__Before she will start doing a similar activity, she will read though the retrospective notes to prepare for it. She noticed, “that&nbsp;many of the lessons learned become internalized over time,&nbsp;but there are always surprises - things we have completely forgotten”.</p>

<p>On activities Linda shares with her husband - like traveling or going to a music workshop - he is joining in to the retrospective. On the way home, they talk about their experience and Linda takes notes of it. Arrived at home, she will send him an e-mail to give him the opportunity to add his comments. When they do a similar activity again, they’ll read the retrospective notes together.</p>

<p>All this writing, re-writing and reading is not without a purpose.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cognitive scientists tell us that writing is important so I always write or&nbsp;sketch first and then type to save. Going through the comments twice also&nbsp;helps with learning – and that’s what it’s all about :-)!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Shared Feedback MindMap - Ilias Bartolini</h2>

<p>Ilias Bartolini[<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/">3</a>], my colleague and&nbsp;coach at ThoughtWorks University[<a href="http://join.thoughtworks.com/graduates">4</a>],&nbsp;has an approach centered around a mind map. He started with his self-review in the beginning of 2012, with a small mind map. He collected the data of what happened in 2011 both for work and life related aspects. The mind map grew and evolved over a couple of weeks - having the mind map always open on his laptop and capturing any important thought, when it came to Ilias' mind.</p>

<p>An important part of this mind map is the feedback Ilias received from friends and colleagues. But then he moved one step further: He shared the result of his personal retrospectives with the people who gave him feedback. Seeing their feedback was&nbsp;recognised encouraged them to give more feedback to Ilias. They supported him in his efforts to change himself and gave input how he can implement the feedback they gave.</p>

<p>In his blog series about his approach to self-reviews ([<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/01/30/a-feedback-based-review-why-part1/">5</a>], [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/01/31/a-feedback-based-review-how-part2/">6</a>], [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/02/02/a-feedback-based-personal-review-you-part3/">7</a>] and [<a href="http://iliasbartolini.dyndns.org/~brain/index.php/2012/02/03/a-feedback-based-personal-review-us-part4">8</a>]), Ilias tells us, that this approach helped him to create an&nbsp;epiphany of what happened in his year 2011. Doing the self-review gave him self-confidence and helped him to improve his effectiveness. Most of it, because he started to understand what really matters at his work and at his life.</p>

<p>He internalized this approach so much, that he is constantly applying it. Recently, he put parts of his mind map onto a whiteboard and asked his colleagues to give their comments to it. Here is what he got:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF20581.jpg"><img src="https://blog.jthoenes.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF20581.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Currently Ilias is&nbsp;perpetually&nbsp;changing his feedback mind map. When he receives new feedback, he will update the mind map. This is his way, to keep track in which areas he needs to work on himself. But more important, it gives him confidence by clearly documenting what he already has&nbsp;archived.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find going back to the mind map summary very useful in many more situations!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Building on top of Retrospective Practices - my own approach</h2>

<p>In 2008 I listen to the excellent Software Radio Episode 105
“Retrospective with Linda Rising”[<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2008/07/episode-105-retrospectives-with-linda-rising/">9</a>]. I was excited about potential
retrospectives could unveil inside a team. But at this time, I was a
student and had no team were a retrospective could be hold. However,
in the beginning of the episode, Linda told that she believed,
everyone should have a retrospective of their own. It sunk
into my brain and stayed there unused for a while.</p>

<p>In mid 2009 I graduated and got my first programming job. I started to
work, moved to a new city and met new people. All was going as
planned. But I was not clear about what my next goal in life would be.
Up until this point, my whole life was working towards this very
point. But what to do next?</p>

<p>This became clear to me shortly before christmas, as I told
it to my father. Telling it someone, made something explicit to
myself. But I suppose it has been in me quite a bit earlier.
Consequently, I decided to do a year-end retrospective for 2009.</p>

<p>I bought some nice food, drinks paper and coloured crayons and blocked
4 hours in my calendar on a Sunday afternoon. Then I created a
timetable of the retrospective practices I wanted to do</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a timeline of the year 2009 and then make your feeling towards the&nbsp;events visible with colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make notes and later write an essay about: ‘What works well’, ‘what to&nbsp;do differently’, ‘What did I learn and what puzzles me’</p></li>
<li><p>Make a mindmap of the result of the retrospective.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I executed the plan - and was very delighted with the outcome. It
really helped me to see things in my life, I did not notice before. On
this day, I started to understand more about myself - and I did set
goals for myself and selected action items to reach these
goals.</p>

<p>One action item was to make personal retrospectives a ritual every
three month. Six month later, during one of these
quarter-retrospectives, I decided to do a heartbeat retrospective
every week. I have adapted the way I do retrospectives and the scheme
of having them since. I’ll write about this in a different article.</p>

<h2>There are more possibilities</h2>

<p>There are&nbsp;hundreds&nbsp;of more ways to do personal&nbsp;retrospectives. I’ve talked to someone, who travels home by train for one hour every day. Instead of reading or listening she spends the time reflecting about her day - having a retrospective every day.</p>

<p>Aisley Nies[<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Personal-Retrospectives">9</a>] takes some time around her birthday every year and travels somewhere. She gets “away from everything” and spends some time thinking about herself.</p>

<p>You can also read the retrospective reports from Aimee Daniells [<a href="http://sermoa.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/aimees-2011-retrospective-a-year-in-review/">10</a>] and Mark Neeham [<a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/01/03/my-software-development-journey-2011/">11</a>] on their blogs. This gives you a hint, how they did their own personal retrospectives for the year 2011.</p>

<h2>What about you?</h2>

<p>Have you started or scheduled your own personal retrospectives?&nbsp;How will you make personal retrospectives work for yourself? What hinders you to start?</p>

<p>Please leave a comment or blog about it and drop me a link. I’m very&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in the different approaches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> has given rise to a new generation of chess enthusiasts. <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/"><em>How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</em></a>’s traffic quadrupled between October and November 2020, and Lichess traffic <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">jumped 10%</a> in that same span. To all the new and reengaged chess players, welcome!</p>
<p>As part of this surge of interest, many new players have sent me questions and comments on openings. What opening do I choose? Is the reason I lose because I don’t want to memorize as many openings as my opponents? What do you think about [insert opening here]?</p>
<p>Here’s my thesis:</p>
<p><em>The best opening for rapid chess improvement is the one that gets you to a comfortable middlegame position with as little work as possible<sup>1</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article lays out specific, concrete openings that I’ve selected for you. They require minimal study, work against a variety of responses from your opponent, and naturally flow to comfortable middlegame positions. These are well-established, sound openings that my students have seen success with, and there are multiple openings you can choose from to suit your own chess preferences and tastes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that you understand the basic opening principles of developing your pieces, controlling the center, getting your king safe (usually via castling), and connecting the rooks. <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/opening-principles">Chess.com’s interactive primer</a> looks good if you’re not familiar with them or need a refresher. It’s also helpful to be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this post is designed to help you improve without a coach, I’m taking on a few students to coach within this structure to help accelerate their improvement. If that’s something you’re interested in, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d5a5c48495c507d5a5c48495c50535c4f48515c135e5250">gautam[at]gautamnarula.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Openings for White</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, I quickly recommended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">The London System</a> and moved on without elaborating much further. I’m going to go a little more in-depth about the London here, as well as offer other options (including a 1.e4 option!) for players who don’t enjoy the types of positions that emerge from the London.</p>
<p><strong><u>Opening for 1. d4 players: The London System or the Colle-Zukertort</u></strong></p>
<p>The London System features the moves 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. Bf4, 4. e3, followed by c3, Bd3, Nbd2 and O-O in the appropriate order depending on the opponent’s moves (Diagram 1). It has been <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1813667">deployed</a> by none other than World Champion Magnus Carlsen! It’s so difficult for Black to stop you from achieving this basic setup that it’s not necessary to write out sample lines like I do for the e4 opening below.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 1: </strong>The ideal London System setup.</p>
<p>A cousin of the London system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_System">Colle</a>, where the pawn is pushed to e3 before the c1 bishop has moved, blocking it in. The <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1025949">Colle-Zukertort</a> is an improvement on the Colle where that bishop is fianchettoed on the queenside, and can lead to some more interesting positions than the London in my experience (Diagram 2).</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 2: </strong>The ideal Colle-Zukertort setup. Notice that compared to the London System, the f4 bishop is now on b2 and the c3 pawn push has been replaced with the b3 pawn push.</p>
<p>One example Colle-Zukertort line:</p>

<p>Some ideas for White here: placing a rook on c1 and pushing for central expansion with c2-c4, or placing a knight on e5 followed by a f2-f4 push and a potential kingside attack.</p>
<p><b><u>Opening for 1. e4 players: The King’s Indian Attack</u></b></p>
<p>1. e4 openings are inherently more difficult to play than d4 openings<sup>3</sup>, so we’ll have to spend a little more time learning my pick, the King’s Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA has a storied history, with <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008365">many stunning victories coming from a young Bobby Fischer</a> in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. It’s basically the King’s Indian Defense (which is, more or less, my recommendation as Black) with colors reversed, and the extra tempo from playing as White gives you the flexibility to play it against just about anything.</p>
<p>The KIA setup involves the moves e4, d3, Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, typically resulting in the structure in Diagram 3.<span><!-- [if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p><b>Diagram 3:</b> Standard KIA setup.</p>
<p>White’s king is castled and safe, and White exerts control of the center with the two pawns and knights. White’s main plan is a well-timed e4-e5 pawn push, accompanied with gaining space and potentially aiming for a kingside attack (those acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Closed_Sicilian">Closed Sicilian</a> will find these kinds of positions familiar). The main challenge is to figure out how to develop the c1 bishop efficiently.</p>
<p>Below are a few sample lines of what you might face:</p>
<p><b>1…e5 (King’s Pawn Game)</b></p>

<p><b>1…c5 <strong>(Sicilian Defense)</strong></b></p>

<p><strong>1…e6 (French Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…d5 (Scandinavian Defense)</strong></p>
<p>The Scandinavian used to be a great surprise opening and rare enough that in years past I wouldn’t have included it here, but thanks to the valiant efforts of IM John Bartholomew and #teamscandi it’s become pretty popular at the amateur level (and I’ve been recommending a Scandi variant to my students for over a decade as well, so naturally my massive influence has popularized it and shifted the frontiers of chess at both the amateur and professional levels). Unfortunately, you can’t go into a standard KIA structure (1. e4 d5 2. d3 dxe4 3.dxe4 Qxe1+ 4. Kxe1 and clearly this is a very different kind of game).</p>
<p>So instead, my suggestion is to exchange the pawns and bring the knight to c3 followed by the KIA style fianchetto.</p>
<p> You can do the same against 3…Qd6, which I recommend for Black below. White has a flexible and comfortable position and aim to exert more central control with Rf1-e1 and potentially maneuvering one of the knights to e4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Opening for 1. c4 Players: Read a Book</strong></span></p>
<p>I said it in How to Get Good at Chess, Fast and I’ll say it again: you’re on your own. Being a hipster has its costs. Truth hurts! I’ve heard good things about <a href="https://amzn.to/38xREcp">Starting Out: The English</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Openings for Black</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, for Black I recommended a kingside fianchetto setup involving the moves Nf6, g6, d6, Bg7, and O-O (Diagram 4). I’ll elaborate on that here. I also offer an alternative option, the Qd6 Scandinavian + …g6 Slav, for those who prefer to contest for central control right away rather than let White immediately build up a center.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 4: </strong>The basic kingside fianchetto structure.</p>
<p>The idea behind this structure is its flexibility. You can strike in the center with …e5 and …Nc6, potentially following up with a kingside attack. You can play more on the queenside with …Nbd7 and …c5, potentially transposing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence">Sicilian</a> line.</p>
<p>Experienced players might point out that this could lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defense">King’s Indian Defense</a> (KID) or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_defense">Pirc Defense</a>, which turn out to be rather complicated openings. This is true, but you can play both these openings with little theoretical knowledge up to the 1600 level and still be fine. The main idea you need to be aware of is avoiding getting overrun in the center with a well timed …e5 or …c5 push if white is building up a central pawn phalanx. Here are a few sample lines which show this idea.</p>
<p>The King’s Indian Defense:</p>
 <p><span>Notice Black plays 4…d6 rather than castling first, makes it more uncomfortable for white to kick the knight around with 5. e5 (5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Nxd1 Ne4 is much more comfortable for Black). Black also plays 6…e5 to strike back at the center. If White plays 7.d5, Black has the logical move 7… Nbd7 with the goal of trying to secure the c5 square for the knight.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the main line of the KID, and I included it here so you can see the ideas in action – White has the option of building up a strong center against the fianchetto system<sup>2</sup> and Black <em>must</em> counterstrike in the center to avoid an uncomfortable and inferior position. On the flipside, White has to watch out for the fianchettoed g7 bishop – many games are decided by tactics against a rook on a1 or a knight on c3. </span></p>
<p>For e4, we have the Pirc Defense:</p>
<p> Similar ideas here: strike back at the center ..c5 or …e5 at the appropriate moment. A related idea is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_(chess)">Hedgehog structure</a>, which is also surprisingly resilient.</p>
<p>You may also want to review opposite side castling attacks, which could happen if White decides to castle queenside instead. These games are a lot of fun but can get a bit crazy!</p>
<p><strong><u>The g6 Slav + Qd6 Scandinavian</u></strong></p>
<p>Some of my student’s have seen great results with kingside fianchetto structures, but I’ll admit these structures can result in games that are a bit intense. This is a quieter alternative that’s still easy to learn and leads to interesting positions.</p>
<p>Against d4, my recommendation is the g6 Slav (my engine tells me this is called the Schlechter Variation), which almost always will go 1…d5 2…c6 3….Nf7 4…g6, typically with …Bg7 and …O-O to follow <strong>(Diagram 5)</strong></p>

<p>One typical variation could go:</p>

<p>Another is to exchange the pawns on d5:</p>

<p>A variant of this plan is for White is to pressure d5 with Qb3 and Bg5 to force Black to play e6 and lock in the c8 bishop:</p>

<p>Black gets a flexible position and, by not committing a pawn to e6 early like in other similar openings (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense">Semi-Slav</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence">French</a>), leaves the possibility open in non-Qb3 variations for developing the c8 bishop to a good square and only then playing e6 to support the d5 focal point in the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against e4, my recommendation is the Qd6 Scandinavian, which begins with 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 (Diagram 6).</p>

    <p>
    If you're a blogger or anyone who makes things to read on the web, you have a problem. While there are people with the energy and ability to read long pieces, there are often people stuck using phones with resolutions not well suited to reading, or people who lack the attention span to read something longer than a page. Frankly, I have found myself as both of these people due to my reading habits. So how can you expand your audience to people in these predicaments? I'd suggest using NewSprint on your site. NewSprint has a twofold advantage. The former advantage is that it is better for your eyes by advancing text for you so you don't have to move your eyes and by having a large font that can fill the page, as it only needs to display one word at a time. The latter advantage is that because you no longer have to move your eyes or strain to make out words, you can read much faster than you would otherwise. These advantages can make content more welcoming to smaller screens and shorter attention spans, two demographics which are highly represented. Here are some features of NewSprint:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://example.com/">links</a>, which are commonplace in most blogs.</li>
        <li>custom output location(passed in the second argument, if you wish to remove the NewSprint popup via dom manipulation)</li>
        <li>custom css(which can be passed into the nsprint function as a link in the third argument)</li>
        <li>adaptable reading, by utilizing the mozilla readability library</li>
        <li>low filesize, the dropin buttons are only 440 bytes, 246 bytes and 213 bytes(in descending order), the main program is only 3.4k, with a 2.1k stylesheet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You're likely wondering now, how do I implement this? I've prepared some examples with instructions on how to implement them, ranging from simplest to most advanced.

    Here's the simplest solution, the drop-in button. With this, all you need to do is include the following code in your site:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script'),c=a.createElement('script');c.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mozilla/readability/Readability.js';b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';c.type='text/javascript';b.onload=a.head.appendChild(c);c.onload=function(){nsprint((new Readability(document.cloneNode(!0))).parse().textContent)};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_aa.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>2) Drop-in with custom text:</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the (second) simplest solution, the drop-in button, with specified text. This method has higher accuracy than the prior model, and is still accessible to people who only work in html:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script');b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';b.onload=function(){nsprint(a.getElementsByClassName('sprtxt'))};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_ct.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>3) Drop-in with plaintext:</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the third solution, the drop-in button, with plaintext from a variable. This method is perhaps the best, however it is third because it requires basic javascript knowledge, additionally, links are in markdown format:
    </p>
    <p>
    &lt;script&gt;
    var preDefinedText = "changeme [links](https://example.com)";
    &lt;/script&gt;
    
    &lt;button onclick="(function(a){var b=a.createElement('script');b.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/js/ns_opt.js';b.type='text/javascript';b.onload=function(){nsprint(preDefinedText)};a.head.appendChild(b)})(document);"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaketrock/newSprint@master/ico1.png" height="50%" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
    </p>
    <a href="https://cleanconnect.us/programs/newSprint/demos/dropin_pt.html"><h2>demo</h2></a>
    </div>
    
    <hr>
    <div>
    <h2>4) Raw Source:</h2>
    <p>
    The final option is just to take a look at the raw source, which is listed on github:
    </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/JakeTrock/newSprint"><h2>source</h2></a>

And happily, a lot of educators and curious players are sharing our passion. Since our <a href="https://luden.io/" rel="noopener">first released games</a>, we talk to teachers, parents, and therapists on a regular basis. Learning more and more about their needs we understood that we want to find a field where educational video games can serve as a vital daily tool, not as yet another extra material.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8000/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png" width="4000" height="2250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2kLJW1K1cj5PK2y5SmUDEw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>First versions of logos for Rewire</figcaption></figure><p id="149d">Several educators approached us at different times, suggesting that we should develop a game for players with learning differences. This is when we’ve teamed up with a clinical psychologist friend of ours and started drafting what later became <a href="https://rewire.education/" rel="noopener">Rewire.Education</a> — an interactive course for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and related disabilities.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/846/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png" width="423" height="298" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/846/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png 423w" sizes="423px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*jM97Ma7cORzlZxbSWcadAQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Number of lessons conducted every week since September 2018</figcaption></figure><p id="18a1">This project took us onto a 2-years journey and resulted in a bunch of researches, a dragon, thousands of lessons, a couple of VR games, a browser adventure, an app for certified specialists, and finally a simulation game about emotions and communication that we’re working on right now (and you are invited to play the early friends-and-family version of the game — <a href="https://ludenio.substack.com/about" rel="noopener">sign up here</a>).</p><p id="8ccc">At the beginning none of us knew much about autism. We did know, however, that autistic learners have troubles generalizing social skills and maintaining attention during classes, so VR was a good option to start with. It was also kinda personal: our previous educational VR games received lots of positive feedback, but they were one-time tools, and we wanted to create an educational game that could be applied on a regular basis.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Ocbiie5rFJn8xcZ3-GND-g.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Distraction-free room made in Unreal Engine 4 for Oculus Go VR headset</figcaption></figure><p id="1345">Our therapist friend had little experience of working with autistic people, but she did help us connect to a private school York, which specialized in working with learners with ASD. Shortly before approaching them, we assembled a prototype of a <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">sorting exercise in VR</a> using Unreal Engine 4 made by Epic Games and Oculus Go headset, which was pretty much as far as our understanding of education for autistic people went at the moment.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1848/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg" width="924" height="577" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0rdDrRAgWzEmjuNfvXTTWg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Presenting the very first version at the educational conference in Atlanta, GA</figcaption></figure><p id="168f">It quickly turned out, however, that there was nothing about sorting exercises in real life, that could be improved with virtual reality. On the other hand, educators were struggling with generalization of skills in the context of social situations, such as going to a mall or visiting a dentist. They suggested that we should start by developing an exercise for establishing and maintaining eye contact. But by the time we finished working on this exercise, the school had stopped answering our emails, so we didn’t have a chance to test it in action. Perhaps they didn’t see any use for what we were doing in their work, but we’ve decided to not give up and move on.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7680/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*5nJDZOZTQXNDDJqGr4346A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c36a">A new exciting page of Rewire’s history began when we brought <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">this prototype</a> to “Our Sunny World”, one of the biggest educational institutions for people with autism and related disorders in Russia. Since we were in the same city, it was possible for us to iterate together on a regular basis, and the specialists from “Our Sunny World” quickly proved very interested in experimenting with the new media, and full of ideas.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>You can download ABA VR here <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635" rel="noopener">https://gamejolt.com/games/abavr/483635</a></figcaption></figure><p id="4bd7">We were attending about 5–10 classes per week, assisting the therapists while they were helping their learners interact with an Oculus Go headset. Through the summer of 2019, we have developed together several new exercises for our VR simulation, directly based on the tools that therapists were using in their work. Our hypothesis was that virtual reality would cut off all possible distractions, while simultaneously making it easier for a learner to go through trials and errors, due to the “playful” and “unreal” nature of the process. In other words, we supposed that the children would be less discouraged by their mistakes if they happened in VR.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/46/1*k1K3bFnwvhLpg_MYIOUxUg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ae30">These experiments brought us to many interesting results and little breakthroughs (you can read about it in detail <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/rewire-education-3-stories-from-teachers-who-made-video-games-for-autistic-students-63783dfd7fc">here</a>). One particularly interesting case occurred later in winter 2020 when we conducted a 2-months long <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/vr-experiment-children-with-asd-spatial-category-training-f05aa51da142">experiment</a> in trying to learn new skills using VR simulation. The results were promising, but we still decided to put the VR part of the project aside in the end.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5080/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png" width="2540" height="1298" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*11L04Gporgfk7dtcux4ngQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="3196">Our collaboration with “Our Sunny World” resulted in dozens of hours of experimenting, prototyping, iterating, and exchanging ideas, but the result didn’t look like something that educators would apply in their everyday work. Through the fall of 2019 we have been <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/rewire-vr-lessons-open-mind-school-experience-b284efe293c9">showing</a> Rewire.Education to many teachers and therapists in the US, and our work did not exactly turn to be a silver bullet for them. VR headsets were not too easy to handle for an average teacher, nor they were affordable and ubiquitous. VR part of Rewire required a very enthusiastic and progressive educator to persuade their superiors to adapt to their school. Needless to say, such educators are a very rare breed. Besides, when it came to social situations, there already existed an amazing project called <a href="https://floreotech.com/" rel="noopener">Floreo</a>, which offers out of the box VR solutions for iPads and iPhones. We sincerely recommend it to anyone interested in applying VR to autism education.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif" width="480" height="270" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/960/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif 480w" sizes="480px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*uXXJLhy5SnCFMlokVtzplA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="b92d">But the thing we were really after was an understanding of where we could apply our expertise in video games to help the educators improve the lives of people with ASD. The answer to this riddle was looming in front of us, but we were unable to grasp it just yet. At the same time, we were experimenting with VR, another educator from “Our Sunny World” came up with an idea of a cooperative game that would help explain the importance of cooperation with other people.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ceb8">This is how we created <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/ta/481537" rel="noopener"><strong>Rewire Teamwork Adventure</strong></a>, a little browser story about two heroes, joining their effort on a quest to defeat an evil dragon. While working on this game, we were also very much inspired by the work of our friends and <a href="https://gametogrow.org/" rel="noopener">Game to Grow</a>, who are adapting D&amp;D tabletop RPG system for therapy and teaching communication.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2018/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif" width="1009" height="570" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*TsnpzMAGjfk0PVLQdKt_-A.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="e782">We have <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.luden.io/teamwork-adventure-game-for-children-with-asd-48739db1318c">playtested</a> Teamwork Adventure with some autistic children under 10 years old and saw very interesting happenings in the process. All that brought us to the general idea, that the direction in which we should be heading is <em>communication</em>. But before we headed this way, we had stumbled upon a very peculiar side quest.</p><p id="47cf">By December 2019, we have spent many hours talking to educators who work with autistic students. We have mostly been focusing on specialists working in the field of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), as this approach was scientifically proven to be effective and its methods were structured enough for our IT brains to comprehend.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TdRyJynbKQcqBsc-jZ1bvw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="294a">While talking to many ABA professionals, we have noticed that virtually all of them were struggling with flashcards. These cards were piled up in the cabinets, they would occupy the whole trunk of one therapist’s car, and therapists would spend hours each week, searching for, printing, laminating, sorting, and resorting those cards. After researching, we have found that there were some digital flashcards apps and services on the market, but nothing specifically tailored for the needs of ABA therapists, so we decided to fix that. This is how we’ve created an app with a rather straightforward name: <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener"><strong>ABA Cards</strong></a>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="127c">Our biggest fear was to develop yet another gimmick app, so we have been trying to talk to as many ABA therapists as we could reach and ask them to test the prototype. Needless to say, that teachers are an incredibly busy bunch, so most of them didn’t have time for a call, but we’ve managed to reach several dozens of respondents. Once again, the ABA department in “Our Sunny World” helped us with their feedback, along with many other local ABA centers and therapists.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3576/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png" width="1788" height="1556" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7QiSk_Cdod6S9Kfn7ybl6w.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c25d">This way, <a href="https://rewire.education/abacards" rel="noopener">ABA Cards</a> effectively included exercises that therapists have specifically asked us to design for their work. For our first prototype, we have developed a selection of lessons based on the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_Behavior_Milestones_Assessment_and_Placement_Program" rel="noopener">VB-Mapp</a> ABA protocol. After another round of interviews, we have added an option to create custom cards and make lessons out of them, along with an advanced data collection tool, based on the therapists’ checklists. We’ve also topped it with remote lessons feature, as by this time it was March 2020, and the infamous COVID-19 lockdown was upon us, and many educators were struggling, not being able to meet their learners face to face, as they usually do. Due to the same circumstances, we’ve made the app free for the period of pandemic.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2848/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png" width="1424" height="1236" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*33YQE7BhktoujCRyAx-U-A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8fb4">After releasing the app in Google Play and AppStore we have <a href="https://youtu.be/STdtG-N2Tjs" rel="noopener">presented</a> it, along with Rewire’s whole story, at <a href="https://www.abainternational.org/welcome.aspx" rel="noopener">ABAI</a> annual conference and went on collecting the feedback, and upgrading the app. Again, our learnings were peculiar, but not too impressive. Less than 10% of users would refer to remote lessons, and overall retention was about 5% by the 30th day.

    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py36 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>82</span><span> seconds

✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py39 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>461</span><span> seconds
</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2
interpreter open, right?</p>

</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:

    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3><p>Newsletter directories sole purpose is to help people find the best newsletters to read in any category they're interested in. Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter. The more eyes your newsletter is in front of the more you'll grow.</p><h3 id="passive-growth">Passive Growth</h3><p>One of the most interesting benefits of submitting your newsletter to a directory is the passive growth you'll receive. Do the work of submitting your newsletter once, get passive subscribe growth forever. Every weekly you'll slowly grow from this channel without needing to think twice.</p><p>Nick Frost from <a href="https://www.newsletters.co/">Newsletters.co</a> and <a href="https://inboxstash.com/">InboxStash</a> says to expect about 10-20 new subscribers the first week you submit to a newsletter directory. Also a newsletter directories authority grows, growth picks up for all newsletters. For more information on the benefits of newsletter directories checkout our interview with Nick Frost, the expert in them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

            <p>All about Newsletter Directories with Nick Frost</p>

<p>Wasmino is an Arduino core fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. It allows you to compile your Arduino sketch to WebAssembly and run it in a browser, all using the Arduino IDE.</p>



<h2>Showcase</h2>



<p>This is the off-the-shelf “Fade” example in the Arduino IDE.</p>


<pre title="">/*
  Fade

  This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite()
  function.

  The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're
  using, be sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins
  are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

  This example code is in the public domain.

  http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade
*/

int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // set the brightness of pin 9:
  analogWrite(led, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness &lt;= 0 || brightness &gt;= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
  delay(30);
}
</pre>


<p>You can see it compiled to WASM and running here:</p>



<p>(<strong>Click the “Run” button</strong> and the LED should start to animate)</p>



<p><a href="https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D">https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D</a></p>



<h2>Setting it up</h2>



<p>Disclaimer: The toolchain is only tested on Windows (x86-64) and Linux (x86-64), and probably will work for MacOS. It 100% won’t work on 32bit systems since some dependencies (WASI and Binaryen) are 64bit only.</p>



<p>You’ll need your Arduino IDE installed first.</p>



<p>Go to File -&gt; Preferences, and add <a href="https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json">https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json</a> to “Additional Boards Manager URLs”.</p>

<p>Install “Wasmino Virtual Boards” in Tools -&gt; Board -&gt; Board Manager. Select Wasmino as as target board.</p>



<p>Write some Arduino code, click upload, and an URL will be generated for you. (If you are uploading for the first time, it will ask you to login to your GitHub account. It uses GitHub Gist for saving the compiled WASM binary. The login times out in 60 seconds.)</p>

<p>Paste that URL into your browser and use the UI to add LEDs or toggle switches. The URL will automatically update as you make changes. You can then copy the resulting URL in the browser and share it with other people.</p>



<h2>Caveats</h2>



<p>The Wasmino should be viewed as having an infinitely fast CPU, and operations other than <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code> do not take any CPU time. Calling time functions <code>micros</code> and <code>millis</code> should reflect this. IO can only happen during sleep, therefore you cannot do</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {} // this will hang the browser tab
</pre>


<p>and should do this instead</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {
    delay(50);
}
</pre>


<p>Having a infinitely fast CPU also means that interrupts will only happen during <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code>. It is still good practice to use <code>noInterrupts</code> and <code>interrupts</code> to protect critical sections if you plan to use your code on real hardware.</p>



<p>Other caveats exist such as the lack of <code>BUILTIN_LED</code> macro since Wasmino, being virtual, doesn’t have a built-in LED.</p>

        <section>
            <div><p>I'm <em>still in the game</em>, so join me as I explore the highlights of a second year of independent business and creating Open Source software. I'll share my top blog posts by views, top interviews, books that have influenced me and a little about each project I maintain. At the end of the post I'll talk about what 2021 has in store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a lot of help this year, so I want to thank all my company's customers, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">my GitHub Sponsors</a>, and everyone who contributed or helped to share.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mostpopularblogpostsof2020">Most popular blog posts of 2020</h2>
<p>Over the past year, I've focused on developing the OpenFaaS and inlets brands, and I've also experimented with Medium's Partner Program. These are the four blogs where you would have seen me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openfaas.com/blog">openfaas.com/blog</a> - OpenFaaS tutorials and news</li>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/blog">inlets.dev/blog</a> - case-studies, tutorials and news on inlets</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">blog.alexellis.io</a> - my original blog for experiments, technical writing, tutorials that don't fit with one of the other brands.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexellisuk">medium.com/@alexellisuk</a> - blog posts that I think can be monetized</li>
</ul>
<p>It's been encouraging to see my posts trending on Hacker News, Reddit and Twitter, along with being included in newsletters like <a href="https://kubeweekly.io/">KubeWeekly</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/">cron.weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the most popular blog posts from the year ranked by views:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>I now have hundreds of blog posts going back several years, so it's difficult to read too much into the numbers, as it depends on how much traffic the site gets and where it has trended. A post on Hacker News could get 15k views overnight, and another more impactful post could get a steady stream of 3k per day from organic searches.</p>
<p>This year I've mainly focused on use-cases, and on capturing the imagination. In 2021, you'll see more of the same along with more guest posts on the blogs.</p>
<h2 id="bestinterviewsfeatures">Best interviews / features</h2>
<p>As part of <a href="https://github.com/readme">GitHub's readme program</a>, I was invited to write a feature-length piece on independent business and Open Source development</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readme/alex-ellis">Balancing open source sacrifice and success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this gives you a deeper perspective on what it's like to be on the hook for a large OSS project.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/craigbox?lang=en">Craig Box</a> from Google reached out to me and asked me: "Why aren't you working for a FAANG company for 350K USD / year"?</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Craig had sketched out a brief history of my career in a Google Doc, and we were recording a podcast with his co-host</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/116-independent-open-source/">Kubernetes Podcast #116 - Independent Open Source</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Learn how a developer at a payroll company became a Docker Captain, caused a stir with a prototype, and quit his job to create an independent software business.</p>
<h2 id="influentialreads">Influential reads</h2>
<p>I've read a number of books this year that have had an influence on me. I can't say that I finished them all, but I did get something from each that has helped me with my journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://neildavidson.com/downloads/dont-just-roll-the-dice-2.0.0.pdf">Don't just roll the dice</a> - a short guide to software pricing by Neil Davidson - this book taught me about the "pricing curve" - and how once a price rises above 0USD (think open source), you lose part of your potential market. There is a sweet spot on the curve. It also taught me about "price anchoring" - where a similar product becomes the way people expect your offering to be priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoCFpb">Before The Exit: Thought Experiments For Entrepreneurs by Dan Andrews</a> - this book showed me that a product or project gives a platform and outlet, that once taken away can leave a void. It also challenged the idea that selling a business is the only successful outcome. And that receiving a windfall of cash, isn't necessarily as fulfilling as we would hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38H5okY">The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients by David A. Fields</a> - the main learning in this book is that success is found not in selling what you think you are able to, but in finding what pain a customer might have, and offering a solution that could help. Likewise, they need to sense urgency and enough pain to buy the solution. It also has to be simple enough to make sense to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A good example of this would be Tailwind UI - a series of HTML and CSS snippets built by a designer and marketed to developers. Most backend developers are hopeless at making things look nice on a webpage.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oaFQU5">The Visual MBA by Jason Barron</a> - having spent so much of my life giving all of the value I was creating away for free, this book helped me understand a framework for testing business ideas and iterating on them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, from a business and sustainability perspective, Open Source software fails its creators and only benefits its users.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3hoG0Vd">Start with Why by Simon Sinek</a> - the premise of this book was enough for me to stop and question things. When you're responsible for picking what you're working on, then asking Why? becomes even more important. Why did I start OpenFaaS? Why am I still working on it?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a why and challenging it over time could save us all a lot of wasted time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A common theme in all of these books was that customers buy ways to reduce and remove pain. It needn't be a 10x improvement, but it should be an obvious solution, and they need to have a sense urgency about fixing the problem.</p>
<p>I would also say that I've become more aware of "Indie Hackers" - these are solo developers who come up with what's usually a very trivial idea, but execute on it hard. One example that caught my attention was a service that just <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">makes banner images for blog posts</a>. That was it. That was the product. From the outside, it looks like a simple idea that is easily copied, but by pressing in, he is now earning 8k USD per month from a platform, which I imagine costs very little to run.</p>
<p>When I compare this to my journey with OpenFaaS, and consider that its <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">recurring revenue on GitHub Sponsors</a> is only around 500 USD / mo, from one end-user company, it makes me question the ideology of Open Source Software.</p>
<h2 id="projecthighlights">Project highlights</h2>
<h3 id="inletscloudnativetunnels">inlets - Cloud Native tunnels</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>inlets was created to make tunnels something we could self-host, to get away from the limitations of SaaS products, and to integrate deeply with VMs, containers and Kubernetes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year I launched a landing page and blog for <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a>. To begin with it was just a few pieces of Tailwind UI tied together that showed pricing and features. It was a starting-point, but then over time it's evolved and now even has its own blog with guest posts.</p>
<p>Highlights for inlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inlets blog launched - the first post was about my inlets presentation on <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/10/08/advanced-cloud-patterns.html">"Advanced cloud patterns" at cert-manager's community day</a>. Since then I've seen several guest posts and an uptick in visits to the domain because of SEO and social sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business customers - inlets PRO has seen lots of customer interest over the year, and had its first business customers. I've got used to qualifying leads, following-up on free trials and more used to rejection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a>/<a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> providers - both gained new cloud providers like Hetzner, Azure and Vultr. I couldn't have done this without the support of the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/tag/0.7.0">inlets OSS + PRO syntax</a> - both were quite different and are now almost identical to help with adoption and to make it more intuitive for new users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal customers - some customers feel the price is fair, others expect it to be free. This is just the pricing curve doing its thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most personal customers are choosing inlets PRO to enable their local development, self-hosting needs or to get <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/self-hosting-kubernetes-on-your-raspberry-pi/">Ingress into their homelabs</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It only takes a few seconds to create a tunnel server with inletsctl, but next year, if there's enough interest then I may look into building a managed inlets service.</p>

<h3 id="openfaasserverlessfunctionsmadesimple">OpenFaaS - Serverless Functions Made Simple</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My top highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> adoption and reception</li>
<li>Writing <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introduction-to-serverless-linuxfoundation/">Introduction to Serverless Kubernetes for the LinuxFoundation</a></li>
<li>Going fully multi-arch for all OpenFaaS projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/">Moving the templates to multi-arch with buildx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/birthday-invite/">Celebrating the 4th Birthday with the community</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For OpenFaaS my highlight would be <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>. faasd was initially an experiment to see if <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> would make a good back-end for functions instead of Kubernetes. By removing the support for clusters which have natural latency through their event-drive nature, things like cold-starts got so rapid, that they stopped existing. The cost to run OpenFaaS dropped from "a Kubernetes cluster" to a 3 EUR / mo VPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're still only scratching the surface of what faasd will mean for the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You end up with something that costs less than cloud functions, and has a much better developer experience, with the ability to "scale-up" into Kubernetes in the future.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="arkadeportablekubernetesmarketplace">arkade - portable Kubernetes marketplace</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a></li>
</ul>
<p>arkade now has 40 apps that you can install with one command, and dozens of CLIs that you can install much quicker than using brew or apt-get. This year I've seen around half a dozen projects copy the approach arkade uses to fetch binaries, so I think we're on to something there.</p>
<p>Its real value comes in compounding - when you need several CLIs or Apps for a tutorial or cluster, the speed-up in getting something deployed is huge.</p>
<p>Want self-hosted OpenFaaS, with a public IP and TLS certificate, but running on your laptop, with KinD?</p>

<div>
<h2><strong>FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.</strong></h2>



<p>VIMAGE was first presented in the Paper <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/zec-vimage/">“Implementing a Clonable Network Stack in the FreeBSD Kernel” by Macro Zec in 2003</a> and VIMAGE code appeared first in FreeBSD 8.0, however it wasn’t until FreeBSD 12.0 that VIMAGE was built into FreeBSD GENERIC kernels and it is a bit of an overlooked feature.</p>



<p>If you have used jails before you might wonder what more VNET jails offer or why you would want to migrate from using localhost-based networking. VNET jails give each jail its own isolated copy of the network stack. They get everything from the IP layer up, creating a network stack that is entirely its own, almost anything you could do with a distinct host you can do with a jail and VNET.</p>



<p>VNET network stacks can be given interfaces from the host and once an interface has been delegated into a VNET jail it disappears from the view of the host, becoming only visible in the jail. FreeBSD offers the epair interface that acts as a virtual Ethernet cable. Give one end of an epair to a VNET jail and keep the other end in the host and you have a way to network between the host and the jail or even between multiple jails. Unlike normal jail networking a VNET jail is able to fully use the interface and once given the correct permissions it can perform packet captures and traces as if it were a full host.</p>



<p>VNET allows jails to be closer to full virtual machines with much less overhead and they offer the ability to test networking in isolation with a very similar environment to the jail host.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET with a jail</strong></h4>



<p>The best way to experiment with VNET is to create some test jails and play with their networks. With VNET it is easy and cheap to create a new separate network that will not interfere with the hosts configuration.</p>



<p>First to demonstrate the power the VNET provides we will create a simple jail that only isolates networking from the host. If we run the following three commands on a FreeBSD system we can create a simple jail:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=emptyjail persist vnet
    host # jexec emptyjail /bin/sh
    emptyjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
    options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
    groups: lo
    nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>The important flags to the jail command here are <em>persist</em> and <em>vnet</em>, <em>persist</em> keeps the jail around even though nothing is running inside of it, <em>vnet</em> creates the jail with its own VIMAGE network stack.</p>



<p>The jail we have created contains a loop back interface (lo0) but cannot see any of the interfaces from the host, it has been isolated at the network and process level. Because we do not specify a new root to use for the jails file system, it can see everything on the host file system as before, this can be really handy when you are developing and running tests that take advantage of VNET.</p>



<p>For our jail to be useful we need to be able to access network interfaces, VNET jails can be given any interface and once given to a jail they vanish from the view of the host network stack. When we want to network between the host and the jail we can use an epair(4) device. epair devices are a pair of Ethernet-like interfaces connected back to back, sort of like an emulated patch cable. Each side is denoted with a letter, they come as an ‘a’ and a ‘b’ part. If we create an epair and move one half into the jail, once it is configured we can communicate from the host to the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # ja    host # ifconfig epair create
    epair0a
    host # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
            inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
            inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0a: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0a
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>This time when we create our jail we delegate one half of the epair to it. We need to configure the interface in the jail and on the host. Once we have the interfaces configured we can communicate between the host and jail (Note: when you delegate an interface to a jail all the configuration will be erased. You must configure the interface once it is inside the jail).</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=networkjail persist vnet vnet.interface=epair0b 
    host # jexec networkjail /bin/sh

    networkjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    networkjail # ifconfig epair0b inet 192.0.2.2/24 up     
    networkjail # exit

    host # ifconfig epair0a inet 192.0.2.1/24 up
    host # ping 192.0.2.2

    round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.069/0.106/0.143/0.037 ms
</code></pre>



<p>Python3 is installed on the host and as our jail doesn’t isolate the file system, all installed software is also available to the jail. We can use the http server built in to python3 to demonstrate a simple network service running inside the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # jexec networkjail sh -c "cd /usr/src; python3 -m http.server" 
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>



<p>With this a web browser on the host machine can be pointed at 192.0.2.2:8000 and we can browse around the structure of the FreeBSD source tree that lives in /usr/src. We can run any service that will run on a FreeBSD host from within this VNET jail. The difference here between older jail networking is that we can do anything with the epair that we could do with a real network interface such as place add it to a bridge.</p>



<p>When we remove networkjail the half of the epair that was delegated is returned to the host:</p>



<pre><code>    host # ifconfig epair0b
    ifconfig: interface epair0b does not exist
    host # jls -v
       JID  Hostname                      Path
            Name                          State

<p>When we destroy either half of the epair both halves will be removed from the system, even if the side delegated to a jail.</p>



<p>VNET offers a facility for local testing with a network segment that is very similar to a real network. It is possible to perform any action from the host as you would on a non-virtual network interface such as adding it to a bridge or firewalling.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET to isolate networks</strong></h4>



<p>We are not limited to using virtual interfaces when using VNET, but are able to delegate any interface on the host into the VNET. VNET opens up the opportunity to isolate out chunks of networks allowing us to build complex topologies such as soft routers and firewalls.</p>



<p>We can also use the isolation offered by VNET to offer services from a host on a particular interface that might be undesirable or destructive or if the address space that a piece of equipment uses clashes with the network that the host is on.</p>



<p>On this development machine we have network interfaces on two different networks, one is in the development environment and the other lives in the sandbox testing environment. Never can packets go between the two. The sandbox testing network is where virtual machines live, normally these bhyve machines are configured with a tap interface and they join the network via a bridge interface on the host. VNET allows us to do the same thing, but with jails.</p>



<p>Before we start we need to load the kernel modules for epair and bridge on the host, they normally load automatically on the host when you try to use them, but the jail is unable to do this.</p>



<pre><code>    host # kldload if_epair if_bridge</code></pre>



<p>VNET also allows us to give a physical network interface on the development host to a jail and from that jail create further sub VNET jails that are isolated from the hosts network:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=isojail persist vnet vnet.interface=em0 children.max=1</code></pre>

December 30, 2020 | https://www.talkinghightech.com/en/initializing-js-lock/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.talkinghightech.com/en/initializing-js-lock/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><span id="JS_resource_object"></span>JS resource object<span></span></h3><p>We will start by defining a resource as an object which is loaded into the memory of our process using an async operation, this operation may take a relatively long period of time.  This resource object will be in use very often, computing it from scratch each time will be a huge waste, this can cause our service to be significantly underutilized for no good reason.</p><blockquote><p>This may resemble the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Singelton pattern </a>object initializing in a multi-threaded environment (this is a question that is often used in job interviews) –  which one of the threads will load the resource and only once.</p></blockquote><p>When creating the resource object one may check if the static member is not initialized and initialize the member if needed moving on thinking he just successfully cleared this issue.</p><p>Let’s review the following scenario: the service is highly in use in our server, it gets hits in a ratio of 5/sec, the init resource function will run for ~ 5 sec’. The first request comes in and fires the async  ‘getInstance’ function since it is an async request the event loop will now stop the function execution and resume once the async function has been resolved – in our example after 5 seconds.</p><h3><span id="The_resource_code"></span>The resource code<span></span></h3><pre><code>export class Resource {
  static instance;

 constructor(... args) {
  }

  static async getInstance() {
    if (!Resource.instance){ Resource.instance =
      await ResourceFactory.getInstance();}
    else {
      console.log('no need to init resource we have it')
    }
    return Resource.instance;
  }
}

export class ResourceFactory {
  static getInstance(){
    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=&gt;{
      console.log('init resource')
      setTimeout(()=&gt;{
        console.log('resolving resource');
        resolve(true)
      },5000);
    })
  }
}
</code></pre><p>We can now simulate this scenario  from a user perspective</p><pre><code>let i = 0;
const intervalId = setInterval(async () =&gt; {
  const resource = await Resource.getInstance();
  console.log('resource is init');
  if (i === 50) clearInterval(intervalId);
  i++;

}, 200);
</code></pre><pre><code>init resource
init resource
init resource
init resource
resolving resource
resource is init
no need to init resource we have it
resource is init
resolving resource
resource is init
no need to init resource we have it
resource is init
resolving resource
resource is init
.......</code></pre><p>The output of the function will clearly indicate that we are initing the resource much more than the desired once. Heres the problem, during this 5 sec of initialization we will receive approximately 25 requests, Each of those times the if statement will have a false evaluation and a new request will fire summing up to more then 25 times. after at least 5 sec from the beginning, we will finally receive an instance and the if statement will finally evaluate to false as we desired, still, we have many new init request in the pipeline that we do not need anymore</p><p>Conclusion: a simple if statement examining the resource is inited or not is just not good enough, we need to create some sort of lock mechanism so we can ensure a single init of our resource (again the multithreaded singleton problem).</p><h3><span id="The_JS_lock_%E2%80%93_first_try"></span>The JS lock – first try<span></span></h3><p>Our goal is to create a general-purpose lock so we can reuse it. There are a few ways we can create the requested lock let’s examine the following</p><p>Our lock will be initialized with the number of users that can enter the critical section – in our case we set it to only one.</p><p>Now that we have a lock we will need to block the critical section, we will pass to the lock a callback function that will run our initialization unit.</p><p>The lock will examine how many requests are currently in the critical section if noon it will just let your callback function run, else it will queue your callback until the current user will release it. Once it has been released it the lock will fetch the first callback in the queue and run it.</p><p>Since the callback will run in a different context, be aware to make sure you bind all of your code or use an arrow function to maintain your current context (this).</p><pre><code>class Lock {
  counter: number; // how many can enter the critical section at once
  waiters: any[];

  constructor(counter) {
    this.counter = counter; // how many users can use the resource at one, set 1 for regular lock
    this.waiters = []; // all the callback that are waiting to use the resource
  }

  hold(cb: Function) {
    if (this.counter &gt; 0) { // there is no one waiting for the resource
      this.counter--; // update the resource is in usage
      cb();  // fire the requested callback
    } else {
      this.waiters.push(cb); // the resource is in usage you need to wait for it
    }
  }

  release() { // some one just release the resource - pop the next user who is waiting and fire it
    if (this.waiters.length &gt; 0) { // some one released the lock - so we need to see who is waiting and fire it
      const cb = this.waiters.pop(); // get the latest request for the lock
      // select the relevant one
      // process.nextTick(cb); // if you are on node
      setTimeout(() =&gt; cb, 0); // if you are in the browser
    } else {
      this.counter++;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Ok now let’s integrate it to solve our issue, the only thing we need to remember is once we enter the lock we need to verify again that the resource is not initialized since once we entered the lock after an unknown time the resource may or may not have been initialized – so we need to validate it again (this is known as the double if in the singleton pattern<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="example (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton-double-checked-locking" target="_blank"> example</a>).</p><pre><code>class Lock {
  counter: number; // how many can enter the critical section at once
  waiters: any[];

  constructor(counter) {
    this.counter = counter; // how many users can use the resource at one, set 1 for regular lock
    this.waiters = []; // all the callback that are waiting to use the resource
  }

  hold(cb: Function) {
    if (this.counter &gt; 0) { // there is no one waiting for the resource
      this.counter--; // update the resource is in usage
      cb();  // fire the requested callback
    } else {
      this.waiters.push(cb); // the resource is in usage you need to wait for it
    }
  }

  release() { // some one just release the resource - pop the next user who is waiting and fire it
    if (this.waiters.length &gt; 0) { // some one released the lock - so we need to see who is waiting and fire it
      const cb = this.waiters.pop(); // get the latest request for the lock
      // select the relevant one
      // process.nextTick(cb); // if you are on node
      setTimeout(() =&gt; cb, 0); // if you are in the browser
    } else {
      this.counter++;
    }
  }
}

export class Resource {
  static instance;
  static lock = new Lock(1);

  constructor(... args) {
  }

  static async getInstance() {
    if (!Singleton1.instance) {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        Resource.lock.hold(async () =&gt; {
          if (!Resource.instance) {
            try {
              Resource.instance =
                await ResourceFactory.getInstance();

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

<p>Pay no attention to all those nasty left-wing allegations about how military contractors collude and conspire with the Pentagon to warp our economy, impoverish our citizens, pervert our national goals, and foment needless bloody wars that slaughter millions in order to fatten corporate profits. The truth is actually much worse than you could ever imagine—as this <a href="https://www.claritypress.com/product/understanding-the-war-industry/">chilling new book</a> by Christian Sorensen makes startlingly clear.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is today one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, having been exempted from the 1998 Kyoto protocol and Paris climate change agreement (when the U.S. was abiding by it). There are also now at least 39,000 contaminated military sites across the U.S. and growing numbers of species threatened with extinction and people sickened by the toxic residues of American weapons systems.</p>



<p>In 2018, the top-five war corporations made more than $16 billion at a time when 500,000 Americans were homeless on an average every day. To sustain their obscene profits, they spend millions lobbying Capitol Hill and divvy out millions in campaign contributions to Congress. In 2012 alone, war corporations gave around $30 million and $25.5 million in 2014.</p>



<blockquote><p>Much of this money has gone to appropriation and armed services committees, which rubber stamp gargantuan military budgets that amount to more than the total of the next ten countries combined.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island’s Jack Reed (D), characteristically took money from General Dynamics, Raytheon, Textron, Apollo Global Management (a private equity firm heavy into war industry) and large investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, and used his position to help Textron win a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-textron-bombs-idUSBRE97J0ZF20130820">U.S. contract</a>&nbsp;valued at $641 million to build 1,300 cluster bombs for Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>James Inhofe, Oklahoma’s Republican climate-change denying Senator who has headed the committee under Donald Trump, has taken donations from Boeing, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Huntington-Ingalls, and Orbital TK, along with over $338,000 in the last five years from the oil and gas industry, which profits significantly from overseas military intervention and huge military budgets that Inhofe has always championed.</p>

<p>Besides a corrupted Congress, the military-industrial complex is sustained by the revolving door of Generals who transition from high-ranking military posts to the executive boards of defense contractors where they lobby for ever higher military budgets. James Mattis characteristically went from Commander of the U.S. Central Command to a member of the board of General Dynamics, where he swore before Congress that reduced military spending was a threat to U.S. national security, to appointment in January 2017 as Secretary of Defense, where he oversaw increases in weapons sales and the U.S. war budget. Other high-ranking officials, like former CIA Director John Brennan, have found lucrative jobs peddling new wars on television or in think tanks financed by military corporations.</p>







<p>Sorensen writes that, after pumping the War on Terror for trillions in military spending, the war industry is now “returning to targeting Russia and China through ‘Great Power competition.’” This has “given the Pentagon an excuse to deploy more corporatized troops, mercenaries and goods and services right up to Russia’s borders, while Pentagon leadership has stylized such a permanent war footing as conducive to peace.”</p>



<blockquote><p>The U.S. Executive Branch has meanwhile come to take on the function of an international arms peddler.</p></blockquote>



<p>On any given day, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages 14,000 open foreign military sales cases with 185 countries. The latter include some of the most oppressive on the planet like Israel, which systematically oppresses the Palestinians, using weapons manufactured by Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Motorola and Northrop Grumman, and Saudi Arabia, which has used hardware from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to pulverize Yemen.</p>



<p>From May 2015 through March 2016, American war corporations sold over $30 billion worth of goods and services also to anti-democratic Gulf allies such as the United Arab Emirates, which waged the dirty war in Yemen by proxy and was known for the brutal suppression of dissenting groups. In the Southern Hemisphere, U.S. military and corporate action yielded devastating costs in countries like Honduras and Colombia, where aerial defoliation programs have poisoned the landscape and paramilitary death squads have terrorized trade union activists and supporters of the left-wing Fuerzas Armada Revolucionario de Colombia (FARC) whose principal platform is to redistribute land and wealth.</p>

<p>By law, the U.S. is not allowed to sell weapons to regimes that come to power through coup d’états. However, the war industry successfully lobbied the government not to recognize blatant coups, like that in Egypt in 2013 and Ukraine in 2014. The war industry at the same time does everything in its power to sustain conflicts like in the Koreas, where it profits from an endless military standoff.</p>

<p>It is also in the process of provoking new ones through the Asia Pivot policy that has resulted in the military encirclement of China, promotion of NATO expansion towards Russia’s borders, and deployment of missile technology in Poland and Romania aimed directly at Russia. The inauguration of a $1.74 trillion nuclear modernization effort could ultimately lead humanity down the road to apocalypse.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of Sorensen’s contributions is to show how the war industry sustains a progressive veneer by stressing its “green initiatives” and the diversity of its workforce.</p></blockquote>



<p>John Brennan’s tenure as CIA Director from 2013 to 2017 was marked by his extending new opportunities for African Americans, and many CEOs are now women, like Marilyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin who was voted as “Forbes” most powerful woman in business for three years in a row. Hewson’s feminism, however, does not go very far if we consider her praise for the Saudi regime, which systematically persecutes women, or support for wars which kill women and children, and destroy families.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Pentagon—which Sorensen rightfully calls the “War Department”—failed an audit of more than 2.7 trillion dollars in assets. The accounting firms carrying out the audit concluded that the Pentagon’s financial records were “riddled with so many bookkeeping deficiencies, irregularities and errors that a reliable audit was simply impossible.”</p>



<p>Franklin “Chuck” Spinney, a former Pentagon employee, pointed out a pertinent accounting trick where the Pentagon routinely overestimates inflation rates for weapons systems and does not return the excess funds to the Treasury when actual inflation rates turn out to be lower. Tricks like this result in surplus slush funds which are used to fund shady covert military operations in places like sub-Saharan Africa, whose mineral wealth multi-national corporations covet.</p>



<p>The Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965) once stated that “we live in an era of the scientific savage, where all the wisdom of science, mathematics and physics are used for the purpose of assassination.” These remarks were made before the popularization of the drone, one of the war industry’s favorite products, which has been used to kill at least 8,000 people.</p>

<p>A good first step toward challenging the power of the war industry would be a program of peace education that would create a broader awareness of its harmful activities among the U.S. electorate. Unfortunately, the American educational system has been corrupted and conditions kids from a young age to go along with the status quo. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests forced the removal of military-related research from major universities, but such research returned with a vengeance starting with the budgetary cutbacks of the 1980s and then as part of the War on Terror. Professors now compete with one another for grants that …</p></div></div>

<p>Sometimes secondhand books can come into our possession in ways that make it quite clear they need us to read them.</p>
<p>Such was the case with&nbsp;<em>Le fascisme italien</em>&nbsp;by Pierre Milza and Serge Berstein, (1) which reached me by means of a random sequence of events including a friend moving flat, an unexpected traffic jam and a small public park on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint and, as I am about to explain in more detail, helped me to see a number of crucial issues more clearly.</p>
<p>Firstly, it confirmed that, despite constant claims to the contrary, fascism was not at all anti-capitalist, but extremely pro-capitalist.</p>
<p>Secondly, it presented interesting parallels with the Coronavirus-linked totalitarian mindset so dominant in 2020, which I am calling ‘newnormalism’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it sparked some wider reflection on my part about the participation of most of the left in this 21st century authoritarianism and how that relates to my own anti-fascist position.</p>
<p><strong>FASCISM AND CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p>It is well known, I think, that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, began his political career on the left and, when he started building a movement immediately after the First World War, the initial programme that attracted support was left-wing, with anarchist influences.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Milza-and-Berstein-543x900.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="552"></figure>
</div>
<p>However, as Milza and Berstein make abundantly clear, this prototype fascism was quickly and drastically ditched as Mussolini realised the only way he was going to gain the power he craved was with the support of capitalists and big landowners.</p>
<p>Much much later, at the end of the Second World War, in a desperate last-ditch attempt to rally the Italian people behind them in the face of defeat, the hardcore fascist Saló republic rediscovered their socialist side, but it was all hopelessly too late.</p>
<p>Having lived through the fascist&nbsp;<em>ventennio</em>&nbsp;(20 years), the population were not going to fall for any more redwashing attempts or superficial anti-bourgeois posturing. They had seen clearly that fascism in power defended the interests of Capital, rather than the people.</p>
<p>The authors trace this story back to 1910, when the Italian Nationalist Association was founded with “the support of certain business circles, in particular that of heavy industry”, (2) who had a very obvious direct vestes interest in promoting the nationalist call for Italian participation in the approaching war in Europe.</p>
<p>It was Mussolini’s sudden support for Italy going to war (on the Allied side), that led to him being thrown out of the socialist party, the PSI, splitting from others on the left. This left him ideally placed to benefit from capitalist funding, though it is not clear whether his conversion to the war cause was actually motivated by this consideration.</p>
<p>It is known that Mussolini received money from the French government and from pro-war businessmen like Filippo Naldi.</p>
<p>The first fascist general assembly in 1919 took place in a hall in Milan lent by a group of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascism benefited greatly from the ruling classes’ fear of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Italy, with post-war waves of strikes and a rural movement which reclaimed land from rich property owners.</p>
<p>Explain the authors: “The fear born in the world of the country landowners as a result of the land occupation movement greatly outlived the phenomenon itself and helped pushed them into the arms of fascism, through fear of a challenge to property rights”. (3)</p>
<p>Business organisations such as&nbsp;<em>Confagricoltura</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Confindustria</em>&nbsp;were set up to defend capitalism. Fascism was happy to win favour by providing them with foot soldiers, squadristi, who physically attacked trade unionists and leftists in a wave of “preventative counter-revolution”. (4)</p>
<p>This, say Milza and Berstein, represented fascism’s big break and funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascists started receiving the support of local authorities, the army and the police in their fight against leftist ‘subversion’. They were the system’s emergency weapon against the threat of revolution.</p>
<p>“Prefects, magistrates and officers of the Carabinieri, let the fascists carry on and assure them of impunity. The moment that the State started to crumble, the bourgeoisie, so frightened by the popular uprising of 1919-20, lent their support to fascism’s reactionary violence”. (5)</p>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/squadristi.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Fascist squadristi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In November 1920, for instance, violent fascist squads descended on Bologna, where the radical left had gained control of the local council. There were nine deaths and more than 100 injuries.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the next couple of years, they smashed up trade union and co-operative HQs and attacked working-class districts, wielding clubs and revolvers to force strikers back to work.</p>
<p>By now the fascists had stopped pretending to be left-wing and were openly singing the praises of capitalism and economic liberalism. (6)</p>
<blockquote><p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Mussolini himself set before the future party a manfesto which no longer owed anything to the leftist tendencies of 1919. In the economic realm it was absolute liberalism, with the State indulging in no intervention or nationalisation, or any fiscal measures deemed ‘populist’. On the political and social side, a strong State was to be created, capable of imposing the ban on strikes in the public sector”. (7)</p>
<p>This was authoritarian capitalism, meant to please “the big money interests from whom Mussolini was now seeking political and financial backing”. (8)</p>
<p>As the future dictator said himself: “We are liberal economically, but we will never be so politically”. (9) This was a question of sacrificing political liberalism in the interests of economic liberalism, aka capitalism. (10) (<em>For more on the little-appreciated similarities between fascism and liberalism, see&nbsp;<a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/articles/liberalism-the-two-faced-tyranny-of-wealth/">this article</a>&nbsp;on the orgrad website</em>)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/mussolini-rally2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></figure>
<p>Once the fascists were in power, the clamp-down on opposition was ruthless. Strikes were banned and workers found themselves defenceless against their bosses.</p>
<p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class. When finance minister Alberto De Stefani reformed the tax system in 1923 this “was above all to the profit of the rich”. (11)</p>
<p>He offered tax breaks for foreign investors, did away with the “red tape” of bodies controlling food prices and rents, ended state funding for co-operatives and halted land reforms which threatened the interests of rich landowners.</p>
<p>After 1925, in the face of economic crisis, the pure economic liberalism of the Manchester School went out of the window, in favour of state intervention.</p>
<p>But this was intervention in the interests of business and Capital, not in the interests of the Italian people whom fascism mendaciously claimed to represent!</p>
<p>‘Development’ was at the forefront of fascist plans, as is the case with all industrial capitalists. More land was cultivated and an infrastructure of roads, new towns and industrial estates was built.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Turin-Milan-autostrada.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>“A vast programme of public works was undertaken, carried out by private firms, who were offered lucrative contracts by the State. Electrification of the rail system began, with the construction of tunnels on the Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence lines. A massive roadbuilding programme was entrusted to ANAS (Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade), created in 1928, which oversaw the showcase construction of big toll motorways, the first in Europe”. (12)</p>
<p>This was nothing other than a bailing-out of the capitalist economy by the pro-business fascist state, for which the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the public.</p>
<p>Ring any bells in 2020?</p>
<p>Banks were also treated to fascist largesse, notably BCI, saved by the Italian state with a massive influx of money.</p>
<p>Note the authors: “There was neither socialisation nor nationalisation. The State became capitalist; it guaranteed the property of most of the shareholders and their future dividends. The only socialisation was that of the losses, assumed by the public purse”. (13)</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Istituto-Mobiliare-Italiano.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>In 1931, Mussolini even set up a body,&nbsp;<em>L’Istituto mobiliare italiano</em>, with the role of helping businesses in financial trouble, declaring that this was “a means of energetically driving the Italian economy towards its corporative phase, which is to say a system which fundamentally respects private property and initiative, but ties them tightly to the State, which alone can protect, control and nourish them”. (14)</p>
<p>But the emphasis was very much on the big businesses and financiers allied with the fascist regime. Economic crisis saw numerous small and medium-sized firms go to the wall or gobbled up by big companies, as the fascist state aided this concentration of wealth into ever-fewer hands. (15)</p>
<p>“As for the working classes,” add Milza and Berstein, “they paid the price for this alliance, with unemployment, reduced wages and higher cost of living”. (16)</p>
<p>Fascist corporatism, with its officially-approved phoney trade unions, was supposed to bring together workers and bosses in the interests of the nation, but did nothing of the sort: “It allowed big industry and financial groups to use the State’s arbitration and power of coercion to reinforce their positions and impose their law on their employees”. (17)</p>
<p>“Far from being destroyed by fascism as the first proto-fascist manifesto suggested, Italian capitalism found in it a defender which managed to save it from revolution or collapse and went on to reinforce its structures and its means of action”. (18)</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that the bankers of J.P. Morgan boosted the fascist regime with a $100m loan between 1925 and 1927 (19) or that Winston Churchill praised, during a 1927 visit, Mussolini’s success in defending Italy from what he termed international subversion. He meant the radical left. (20)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bucatini is a kind of pasta that's thicker than average and has a hole in the middle. This stunning display of culinary-architectural brilliance allows it to carry 200% of the pasta sauce load of your average spaghetti, making it popular among enthusiasts.	</p><p>Also, it's super hard to find in the United States right now. Apparently this is because somebody has a beef with one of the primary importers / producers of bucatini in the US, La Cello, and brought their product to the attention of the FDA for violating an iron content regulation.</p><p>Their bucatini contained 2.1 milligrams of iron too little to be considered a macaroni (yes, macaroni, that's what we food heathens in the United States call it). The horror! Think of the children!</p><p>I bring this to your attention because these facts are <em>shockingly</em> uninteresting and boring. If I had to memorize them in history class, I would have undoubtedly have gotten an F minus on the quiz.</p><p>And yet these facts are stuck in my head like white on rice, despite how profoundly little they matter to me.</p><p>The cool thing is, I can tell you why.</p><p>I can also tell you why this post has been sitting on the front page of Hacker News all day (a tech news site, need I remind you, not a food channel).</p><p>Hint: it's the same reason.</p><p>The top comment on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25566652">the Hacker News discussion for this post</a> explains it succinctly:</p><blockquote>The writing style is awesome, I literally laughed out loud. – sam_goody</blockquote><p>In short, the article's voice is hilarious.</p><p>It's witty, endearing, authentic, relatable – so much so that it had the power to make me remember something totally inconsequential simply because of how it was presented.</p><p>If you don't believe me, <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/12/2020-bucatini-shortage-investigation.html">see for yourself</a> –&nbsp;I'll bet you read to the very end of the article (or at least you would have, if I didn't put this disclaimer – now you probably won't just because I postulated that you might – at least, I wouldn't if I were you).</p><p>If you want something to be remembered, say it in a memorable way. Mostly, humor does the trick (unless you're writing an obituary).</p><p>My personal takeaway is that I should take less pains to normalize my writing. I should be more comfortable with exposing my internal monologue to the cold hard air of the judgemental world. I think it just might help me to become a better writer.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this article set the tone within the first few sentences:</p><blockquote>Things first began to feel off in March. While this sentiment applies to everything in the known and unknown universe, I mean it specifically in regard to America’s supply of dry, store-bought bucatini.</blockquote><p>There aren't any humor jump-scares going on here, no sir. The author makes it clear what kind of article you're about to... experience, from the very beginning. This makes it easy for the boring people possessing sticks of poor internal alignment to bail, leaving only the easily-amused and the <em>very</em> bored still reading.</p><p>Finally, as with all things, I think writing humor well is something that only comes with intentional practice. I'm deciding to give it a shot here in this blog, partly because writing can be super boring if I'm not amusing myself with wordplay, but mainly because I want to get better at writing compelling things.</p><p>So, um, sorry in advance.</p></section></div>]]>

        <p>
            A Siren with pixel coordinates together with a time coordinate can be used to parameterize a video.
            Here, Siren is directly supervised with the ground-truth pixel values, and parameterizes video significantly
            better than a ReLU MLP.

        <p>
            By supervising only the derivatives of Siren, we can solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation">Poisson's equation</a>.
            Siren is again the only architecture that fits image, gradient, and laplacian domains accurately and swiftly.

        <h2>Representing shapes by solving the Eikonal equation<br>
            Interactive 3D SDF Viewer - Use Your Mouse to Navigate the Scenes</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We can recover an SDF from a pointcloud and surface normals by solving the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=eikonal+equation&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Eikonal
            equation</a>,
            a first-order boundary value problem. SIREN can recover a room-scale scene given only its pointcloud
            and surface normals, accurately reproducing fine detail, in less than an hour of training.
            In contrast to recent work on combining voxel grids with neural implicit representations,
            this stores the full scene in the weights of a single, 5-layer neural network, with no 2D or 3D
            convolutions, and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Zoom in to compare fine detail!
            <b>Note that these SDFs are not supervised with ground-truth SDF / occupancy values, but rather, are the
            result of solving the above Eikonal boundary value problem. This is a significantly harder task,
            which requires supervision in the gradient domain (see paper). As a result, architectures whose gradients
            are not well-behaved perform worse than SIREN.</b>

                <p>
                    We identify a key relationship between generalization across implicit neural representations and meta-
                    learning, and propose to leverage gradient-based meta-learning for learning priors over deep signed distance
                    functions. This allows us to reconstruct SDFs an order of magnitude faster than the auto-decoder framework,
                    with no loss in performance!

                    <p>So I've been using the Github flow for some years now from both the maintainer side and contributor side to open source projects. I've also been using the email workflow for git from both sides for about a year now. Using email for git sounded quite horrible before I actually started using it. Now I prefer it so I thought I would document my experience here.</p><h2 id="the-github-flow">The Github flow</h2><p>This isn't strictly for Github, it's the flow many developers are accustomed to:</p><ol><li>Fork the project repo</li><li>Make a change on your fork</li><li>Create a pull request from a branch on your fork to the main repository</li><li>Get comments on the pull request</li><li>Force-push to the same branch to update the state of the pull request</li><li>Somebody clicks merge</li></ol><p>Basically the same flow is also used on Gitlab and the other smaller git hosting services. This flow works reasonably well. It gets slightly more annoying after the first pull request because you actually have to keep your own local branch up to date.</p><p>In theory this also gives some nice discoverability of people working on the project by looking at the forks of the project. In practice this is a bunch of outdated copies of the project by people who have mistaken the fork button for a like button.</p><p>From a maintainer point of view this flow also works alright, unless your project starts to grow. For example when postmarketOS was still on Github we ran into the issue that the merge button isn't really useful. Once you have a reasonable volume of &nbsp;pull requests the branches of those pull requests get outdated quickly meaning they have to be rebased before merging or every change will have an extra merge commit in the history. </p><p>In the postmarketOS case it was decided that merge commits are extra noise in the git history we'd like to avoid so we'd need to rebase things, and to properly rebase we have to do it from the command line because Github can't deal at all with conflicts. Rebasing from the command line also gives a lot more flexibility with squashing and having a nice commit message. </p><p>The only reason that merge button was used on Github was because Github can't seem to mark the pull request as merged if it isn't done by the button. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>The all-knowing button from Github</figcaption></figure><p>The old workflow documentation postmarketOS had when Github was used can be read in the wiki history: <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441">https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441</a></p><p>Now we've moved to Gitlab we're basically dealing with the same issue, we have to mess with the commits before merging so we're always force-pushing to the git fork of the author of the pull request (which they have to enable on the merge request, if they don't we first have to tell them to enable that checkbox) and then finally merge them with the button in the web UI so Gitlab doesn't lose track of what happened.</p><h2 id="the-git-send-email-flow">The git-send-email flow</h2><p>The flow for pull requests in github isn't the original way to make pull requests. Since git was originally written for the development of the Linux kernel it has been designed with the workflow of the kernel in mind. The kernel uses mailing lists.</p><p>[insert image of horrified developers here]</p><p>The first patch I emailed was with the assistence of <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">https://git-send-email.io/</a>, I needed to learn how to use the email flow because at the time I was working on my very first kernel patch. This was quite a daunting task involing triple-checking everything against the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html">patch submission documentation</a> for Linux which describes the easy 16 step process.</p><p>Then after the final step the email gets sent out and you wait... for response emails.</p><p>Since then I've made contributions to projects hosted on Sourcehut, which also uses the email workflow, and now I also maintain some projects on this platform. For example <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/megapixels">Megapixels</a>.</p><p>This is the workflow for submitting a patch to a project using the email flow:</p><ol><li>Clone the repository locally</li><li>Make your changes on your local checkout</li><li>Run <code>git send-email</code> with a ref pointing to one or a range of commits</li><li>Get comments as response to the patch as emails, mirrored on the webpage of the mailing list</li><li>Fix up your previous mistakes, run <code>git send-email</code> again with the <code>-v2</code> argument to send an updated version</li><li>The maintainer applies the patch from the email.</li></ol><p>As a maintainer getting the patches like this is quite nice since unless there's a conflict you don't have to merge branches or rebase things, the patches is just ... a patch, it only has the changes from the author, not the full git history.</p><p>Also, one thing to note about the process above is that, except for receiving the feedback, it will never touch your mail client. Git does SMTP itself and make sure the emails you send out are up-to-spec so maintainers can apply the changes directly by feeding the email into <code>git am</code></p><p>If your main complaint is that email is horrible to work with, the issue is most likely not email, it's probably your mail client.</p><p>One of the other main issues with the email workflow is that you can't just see the full state of the "pull request" because there's no nice pull request page to see what's happening. This is one of the main reasons I like the mailing lists on Sourcehut, the patch view fixes most of the visibility issues, for example this simple patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382">https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382</a></p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>The overview of a patch submitted to a Sourcehut mailing list</figcaption></figure><p>There you see the patch description in the first block, which is in this case didn't have any extra text added in the <code>git send-email</code> stage, so it only shows a summary of the changes in this patch.</p><p>Below that is the actual patch, with the subject of the patch as header and then showing the full commit message below that if there were more lines and then the full diff. This patch can also be exported directly as a .patch file using the link right of the subject.</p><p>Finally, below the diff is a comment from Eyal who applied this patch to the development branch and thanked the author; the mailing list will generate a nice threaded view here if there's more discussion.</p><p>The block on the right will show the status of the patch, <code>APPLIED</code> in this case and gives some extra tools to get a copy of the full patchset that can be applied using <code>git am</code></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I personally prefer the e-mail workflow now, it saves me from keeping branches/forks up to date as with this workflow only diffs are sent around. Also after working in Gitlab for most of the things I do on postmarketOS I really like how quickly sourcehut pages load and that I just can get all info from the patch without clicking on tabs to switch between comments, diffs and commit messages with loading times in between.</p><p>Also one nice improvement is that instead of doing half the maintainer flow in the browser by clicking things and half by patching stuff up in my local git branch and force pushing that, it just lets me do everything in the shell and then just send an email back telling the author their patch got merged.</p><p>All together people are most likely already used to having all the comments and info emailed to them as notifications, it's just that in the gitlab/hub case it will send you a link to continue on their website and in the sourcehut/email flow case the email is everything you need to continue without ever opening the browser.</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 28th, President Donald Trump signed into law an omnibus spending bill allocating $1.4 trillion in federal funding for the 2021 fiscal year. Covering everything from pandemic-relief provisions to defense spending, the massive bill also contains the FY 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, which codifies U.S. covert and clandestine operations and defines requirements for reporting to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since it was first presented by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in June, this year’s Intelligence Authorization Act has been of unusual interest thanks to an included provision titled “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In this inclusion, the committee offered intriguing support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence” and requested the production of an unclassified report detailing the analysis of UFOs, or as The Pentagon now terms them, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the recent passing of the Omnibus, seemingly the clock is ticking and The Pentagon’s UAP Task Force now has 180 days to provide the Senate Intelligence Committee with their unclassified report detailing The Pentagon’s current investigations into UFOs. However, easily overlooked, the provision is not law and there is still no guarantee that a comprehensive, “all-source” UAP report will end up seeing the light of day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_18471" width="1170" height="878" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Md7zIXWiTw?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The newly enacted Intelligence Authorization Act incorporates the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report language calling for an unclassified, all-source report on the UAP phenomenon. This was accomplished in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the bill,” says Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and former staff Director of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee, who played an integral role in the development of the legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Consequently, it’s now fair to say that the request for an unclassified report on the UAP phenomenon enjoys the support of both parties in both Houses of Congress,” Mellon told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email. “Assuming the Executive Branch honors this important request, the nation will at long last have an objective basis for assessing the validity of the issue and its national security implications. This is an extraordinary and long overdue opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Origins for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s UAP report request can be traced back to December 2017, when the&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New York Times&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">published an article</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;revealing a secretive study within the Pentagon known as The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Coinciding with the article’s publication were the “unofficial” release of three videos captured by the Navy in 2004 and 2015, which showed indistinctive airborne objects claimed to be UAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April 2020, the Department of Defense officially released the three videos, acknowledging in a statement from the Secretary of Defense’s Office that aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified.” In mid-August, the Pentagon formally acknowledged they had established a task force looking into UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_75296" width="1170" height="658" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHunx8BocSI?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office stated, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">authority for the Task Force was approved</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most vocal advocates for a serious investigation into UFO sightings in recent months has been Luis Elizondo, the former Director of the National Programs Special Management Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, who headed up the Pentagon’s AATIP program. In the fall of 2017, Elizondo resigned from the DoD, citing what he felt was a lack of serious attention being placed on the UAP issue. Elizondo would subsequently go to work for the To the Stars Academy, a UFO-centric organization founded by musician Tom DeLonge.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I believe this is a tremendous step forward in that our representatives are taking this topic seriously,” Elizondo told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email, speaking about the approval of the recent Intelligence Authorization Act.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While this news may be exciting for many UFO/UAP enthusiasts, the UAP report provision is not binding law, so there is no guarantee the public will be provided any comprehensive information on UAP. Additionally, if the <a href="https://thedebrief.org/fast-movers-and-transmedium-vehicles-the-pentagons-uap-task-force/">UAP Task Force deems certain information classified</a>, the legislative branch does not have the authority to declassify that information in order to make it publicly available. With a new executive administration taking office in less than a month, it may ultimately come down to the significance the Biden administration, and new presidential appointees place on the UAP issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We must remain diligent in order to ensure any report submitted to Congress is done to the level and expectations of the committee members,” Elizondo said, “and not simply a whitewash to satisfy yet another Congressional requirement.”</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-39751" data-id="39751"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Christopher Mellon remains cautious but optimistic. “The challenge now will be getting the myriad DoD and I.C.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m hopeful the new Administration will rigorously execute its oversight prerogatives because the concerns of the public and numerous U.S. military personnel have been ignored by a complacent national security bureaucracy for far too long,” Mellon said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>[ 2020-December-28 12:49 ]</h3>
<p>When designing applications that store critical data, it is to important to ensure the data will be durable, so it is accessible after a failure. To better understand the guarantees provided by modern systems, I previously wrote about the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">durability guarantees provided by the NVMe disk interface</a>, and by <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">Linux file APIs</a>. In this article, I will describe what I know about durable writes available on cloud infrastructure. In particular, I will look at AWS and Google Cloud, since I know them the best. After reading their documentation carefully, my cloud storage durability recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instance storage can be lost when the machine is restarted by the cloud provider. I would only call it durable if the application is replicated across more than one zone. Don't bother replicating across machines in one zone, since your data will be lost when the whole zone fails at once.</li>
<li>A network disk in one zone is like a physical server: on rare occasions data will be lost (e.g. 1 out of 100k disks/year). This is probably sufficient for many applications. However, you should take periodic snapshots, since they are easy to set up. In case of a rare failure, you can restore from the last snapshot. With snapshots, this is good enough for most applications.</li>
<li>Network disk replicated across zones should be highly available and durable. This is sufficient for mission critical applications with high availability requirements (e.g. 99.999% or greater availability).</li>
<li>Instance storage replicated across zones can be highly available and durable, but you should be careful due to the risk of correlated failure (e.g. accidentally turning off all instances), or misconfigurations leading to everything running in one zone, or not being correctly replicated.</li>
<li>Object storage is basically as durable as a storage system gets.</li>
<li>All important applications need backups, even applications using object storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, if you have data that really matters, it should be replicated across zones and also backed up periodically. One interesting note is that it is impossible for an external customer to test if the cloud storage options correctly implement the durability they claim to provide. This means we can only really judge based on documentation, observed performance, and experience reports. Now let's look at the available options in more detail.</p>


<h2>Instance storage (AWS)/Local disk (GCP)</h2>

<p>The lowest-level storage option available in the cloud is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/amazon-ec2-instance-storage.html">EC2 Instance Storage with AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd">Local SSD with GCP</a>. This is effectively part of a disk that is directly attached to the physical machine running the VM. This should provide the highest performance, since there is no network and fewer devices between your application and the storage medium. However, it also provides the worst durability. Both cloud providers document that applications should be extremely careful when using instance storage. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/durability-and-availability-4.html">AWS says "local instance store volumes are not intended to be used as durable disk storage"</a>. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd">Google says "Local SSDs are suitable only for temporary storage such as caches, processing space, or low value data"</a>. Let's ignore these warnings, and pretend we write an application that uses only a single instance storage disk. How durable is our data (assuming we use the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-filesystem.html">correct Linux file APIs</a>)? <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/durability-and-availability-4.html">AWS's documentation states</a> that if there is any issue with the host, such as a power failure or an unscheduled reboot, your data will be lost. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#data_persistence">Google's documentation has a more precise list</a> but is roughly equivalent. The biggest difference is that Google attempts to use live migration to move your VM to another host for scheduled maintenence, and they clearly document that "If the host system experiences a host error, and the underlying drive does not recover within 60 minutes, Compute Engine does not attempt to preserve the data on your local SSD".</p>

<p>In short, local instance storage is lower durability than a single physical disk in a physical server. Not only will your data be lost if the disk fails, but your data will also be lost for any other issue that causes the cloud provider to turn off that machine, such applying a security patch. It also is not clear if your data will survive the machine losing power. AWS's documentation suggests reboots will always lose data, but Google's suggests it might, if it comes back within 60 minutes. In either case, I would not trust instance storage with the only copy of my data.</p>

<p>What about a replicated application using instance storage? <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-storage-services-overview/usage-patterns-4.html">AWS's documentation suggests this is a great idea</a>: "instance store volumes backed by SSD [...] are ideally suited for many high-performance database workloads [...] like Cassandra and MongoDB, clustered databases, and online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. [...] applications using instance storage for persistent data generally provide data durability through replication". In my opinion, if you want to rely on replicated instance storage, it <strong>must</strong> be replicated across different zones. If your data is stored on multiple instance storage disks in one zone, then all of them will be lost if that zone loses power, catches fire, or someone accidentally triggers the fire suppression system. From the history of major public cloud providers, single zone failures are relatively likely (e.g. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/09/04/aws_power_outage_data_loss/">AWS us-east-1 power issue on 2019-08-31</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/4372T8/">AWS Sydney region issue on 2016-06-05</a>, <a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/15056">GCP europe-west1-b on 2015-08-13</a>). On the other hand, multiple zone failures are exceptionally rare, so it should be possible to build highly available and very durable systems by replicating between zones. I am a bit nervous about the a mistake or misconfiguration taking down all instances and entirely losing all data, so I think backups are critical.</p>


<h2>Network storage (AWS EBS/GCP Persistent Disk)</h2>

<p>Cloud providers provide "disks" where the data is actually stored on multiple physical devices across the network. The providers call these disks durable. AWS in particular says "EBS volumes are designed for an annual failure rate (AFR) of between 0.1 and 0.2 percent [...] This AFR makes EBS volumes 20 times more reliable than typical commodity disk drives, which fail with an AFR of around 4 percent." Google does not publish their design targets, but similarly claims "Persistent disks have built-in redundancy to protect your data against equipment failure". Google also provides regional persistent disk, that automatically replicates across zones to survive single zone failures.</p>

<p>In my opinion, application data is safer in a cloud network disk than on a single physical disk. There is more than one disk involved, so it will survive the occasional "random" disk failure. However, they are not perfect. In particular, single zone failures that cause a large number of physical machines to fail at once do happen. During these incidents, customers have permanently lost disks. I personally like to think of an application with data on network storage to be roughly the same durability as a physical server with RAID. It will survive many failures, but data will be lost on rare occasions. Both AWS and Google recommend that customers take periodic disk snapshots, so disks can be restored in case of failure. These disk snapshots are fast, easy and cheap, so I highly recommend doing this for any disks with important data. Just remember to test restoring the snapshots periodically, to make sure you know how to do it, and that they actually work.</p>

<p>The next level of durability is to store application data on multiple network disks in different zones. These applications should be highly durable, since a failure would have to occur across multiple disks in multiple zones. Cloud providers design zones to fail independently, so this should be an exceptionally rare event. This is an excellent configuration for applications that need the highest availability and durability.</p>


<h2>Do you need to use forced disk writes with cloud network disks?</h2>

<p>An interesting question is if applications need to use forced disk writes with cloud network disks to get durable writes. That is, if the does not send a FUA write or cache flush (see <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">my article about the NVMe interface</a>), will writes survive if the host machine or the entire zone loses power? Unfortunately, only the cloud providers can really answer this question. However, from the information I have found, it appears that both AWS and GCP disks only acknowledge writes after replication when the writes are considered durable. I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18980193">found a comment from an AWS engineer that claims</a> "All writes to EBS are durability recorded to nonvolatile storage before the write is acknowledged to the operating system running in the EC2 instance [...] explicit FUA / flush / barriers are not required for data durability". This means writes will survive both the host failing and the entire zone losing power. I have not been able to find similar information for GCP persistent disk, but testing with FUA writes and cache flushes shows that they appear to have nearly zero impact on throughput or latency, so I suspect it is the same. This means that applications could get away with <code>O_DIRECT</code> writes only, and FUA writes and cache flushes are probably unnecessary. However, since there is nearly no performance impact, you might as well use <code>O_DSYNC</code> or <code>fdatasync</code> anyway, since then your application will work correctly on other disks. My guess is that Amazon and Google implement this with the equivalent of battery-backed RAM, just like hardware RAID disk controllers often do.</p>


<h2>Object storage (S3/GCS)</h2>

<p>The object storage systems (AWS S3, GCP GCS) provide very ambitious durability claims. They store data in multiple zones, and claim they will only lose some astronomically small fraction of objects. This type of storage is basically as good as it gets in terms of durability guarantees. However, these impressive claims do nothing to protect you from bugs, mistakes, or bad actors. If your primary data storage is in one of these systems, you should still …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Kotlin’s data classes are cool. They are the recommended way of replacing POJOs
and it is usually recommended to use them with <code>val</code>s so the classes are
immutable.</p>
<p>They come with a handy <code>copy()</code> method that “clones” the data class, which can
also be parameterized with any named argument, so the new object has all the
fields of the original class + the overridden fields. So far so good.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-kotlins-copy-work-under-the-hood">How does Kotlin’s copy() work under the hood?</h3>
<p>The way this is implemented in the bytecode is by adding two methods that do all
the heavy-lifting. e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>// shared.kt 
data class Shared(
  val st: String = "some string"
)
</code></pre><p>If we inspect the bytecode of this class we see something like:</p>
<pre><code>$ javap -l Shared.class # I'm trimming irrelevant stuff

...
  public final Shared copy(java.lang.String, boolean, long);
    descriptor: (Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_FINAL
    Code:
      stack=6, locals=5, args_size=4
         0: new           #2                  // class Shared
         3: dup
         4: aload_1
         5: iload_2
         6: lload_3
         7: invokespecial #35                 // Method "&lt;init&gt;":(Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)V
        10: areturn

...

  public static Shared copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, int, java.lang.Object);
    descriptor: (LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC
.... truncated
</code></pre><p>We see here two different copy methods. One is a member method that receives all
parameters necessary to create a copy of a data class. Not sure why this one is
necessary since it basically just calls the constructor of the data class.</p>
<p>In this particular example, it loads the string (<code>aload1</code> to load the first
parameter, i.e. the String), the boolean (<code>iload2</code>), and the long (<code>lload3</code>) and
calls the constructor (<code>invokespecial ... &lt;init&gt;</code>) of the class with that, and
returns that reference (<code>aretrun</code>).</p>
<p><code>copy$default</code> seems to be the one method calling the <code>copy()</code> method. It has a
more interesting signature: it receives the instance being copied (the first
param), followed by all the fields of the data class, followed by an <code>int</code>, and
then a weird <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s first see the bytecode for something using the copy method:</p>
<pre><code>// some.kt
fun doSomething(arg: Shared) {
    println(arg.copy(st = "new-value", l = 10L))
}
</code></pre><p>The bytecode for the code above:</p>
<pre><code>javap -c SomeKt.class 
Compiled from "some.kt"
public final class SomeKt {
  public static final void doSomething(Shared);
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: ldc           #9                  // String arg
       3: invokestatic  #15                 // Method kotlin/jvm/internal/Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter:(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/String;)V
       6: aload_0
       7: ldc           #17                 // String new-value
       9: iconst_0
      10: ldc2_w        #18                 // long 10l
      13: iconst_2
      14: aconst_null
      15: invokestatic  #25                 // Method Shared.copy$default:(LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
      18: astore_1
      19: iconst_0
      20: istore_2
      21: getstatic     #31                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
      24: aload_1
      25: invokevirtual #37                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
      28: return
}
</code></pre><p>The fun part starts at instruction 6: the arguments for the <code>copy$default</code>
method are prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>6 aload_0</code>: loads the instance of <code>Shared</code> to be copied (first parameter for <code>copy$default()</code>)</li>
<li><code>7: ldc</code> this loads the “new-value” constant</li>
<li><code>9: iconst_0</code> loads the boolean</li>
<li><code>10: ldc2_w</code> loads the long param</li>
<li><code>13 iconst_2</code> loads a mysterious int. More on this later.</li>
<li><code>aconst_null</code> passes null as last parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with this information, the <code>copy$default</code> method is responsible for
figuring out which fields it has to copy from the original object and which ones
it needs to override. My guess here is that it uses the int as a mask to infer
this… let’s see if that’s the case. This is the bytecode for the
<code>copy$default</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>  public static Shared copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, int, java.lang.Object);
    descriptor: (LShared;Ljava/lang/String;ZJILjava/lang/Object;)LShared;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC
    Code:
      stack=5, locals=7, args_size=6
         0: iload         5
         2: iconst_1
         3: iand
         4: ifeq          12
         7: aload_0
         8: getfield      #11                 // Field st:Ljava/lang/String;
        11: astore_1
        12: iload         5
        14: iconst_2
        15: iand
        16: ifeq          24
        19: aload_0
        20: getfield      #19                 // Field b:Z
        23: istore_2
        24: iload         5
        26: iconst_4
        27: iand
        28: ifeq          36
        31: aload_0
        32: getfield      #25                 // Field l:J
        35: lstore_3
        36: aload_0
        37: aload_1
        38: iload_2
        39: lload_3
        40: invokevirtual #47                 // Method copy:(Ljava/lang/String;ZJ)LShared;
        43: areturn

</code></pre><p>The fun starts right at the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0: iload 5</code> we are loading that interesting <code>int</code> into the operand stack</li>
<li><code>2: iconst_1</code>  then we load the constant <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>3: iand</code> then we <code>AND</code> those 2 integers. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iand">The result is is push into the operand stack.</a></li>
<li><code>4: ifeq 12</code> means that if the result of the previous step is == 0, then we
jump to instruction 12. Otherwise, we execute the following instruction.
<ul>
<li>When the <code>ifeq</code> does not succeed we replace the parameter (in
this case the first String) with whatever is inside the original object
(<code>aload_0</code> to load the object, <code>getfield</code> to get the String field,
<code>astore_1</code> to replace the method parameter with that value).</li>
<li>Otherwise, it means we need to use whatever value provided as argument to
<code>copy$default</code>, i.e. we will override that field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Same deal for the other two parameters. And then:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>36: aload_0</code> and then <code>aload_1</code>, <code>iload_2</code>, <code>lload_3</code> are used to load the
parameters (or the values we replaced before) into the operand stack so they
can be passed to the <code>copy()</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is not 100% clear, this is what the code would look like if in Java:</p>
<pre><code>public static Shared copy$default(Shared original, String s, boolean b, long l, int mask, Object x) {
    if (mask &amp; 1 == 0) s = original.st;
    if (mask &amp; 2 == 0) b = original.b;
    if (mask &amp; 4 == 0) l = original.l;
    return copy(s, b, l);
}
</code></pre><p>From this, we can infer that this <code>mask</code> int is hardcoded into the bytecode for
calls of <code>.copy()</code>. In the example above, where we are overriding the first and
third fields of the class it passed the number 2 (<code>iconst_2</code>). In binary <code>010</code>,
which when used in the <code>copy$default</code> means exactly that: override the first and
third parameter, but reuse the middle one.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting that the extra <code>Object</code> parameter has no apparent use.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>Ok, so this was fun, but what’s the point. Why is this bad?</p>
<p>This is pretty nice, but I found it can cause issues sometimes. Imagine the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data class lives in library A, v1</li>
<li>Library B uses A-v1 and also calls the <code>copy</code> method.</li>
<li>App X uses both libraries A-v1 and B.</li>
<li>All of them with a different release cadence, and potentially the
responsibility of different teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far so good. Now imaging we update the data class in library A and add a new field:</p>
<pre><code>data class Shared(
  val st: String? = "some string",
  val b: Boolean = false,
  val l: Long = 0L,
  val extra: String? = null
)
</code></pre><p>This might seem like a safe change. We added a new field, but it should not
interfere with any usage of this class. It is in theory backward compatible.</p>
<p>Say we now release library A v2 with this change. And App X upgrades to this new
version. App compiles and releases fine, except that you get a nasty surprise at
runtime:</p>
<pre><code> java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'Shared.copy$default(Shared, java.lang.String, boolean, long, java.lang.String, int, java.lang.Object)'
</code></pre><p>Ooops. Library B’s bytecode still relies on the old signature of library A v1,
and so it fails to invoke that method.</p>
<p>This sucks because technically the class should be compatible. In fact, updating
to library A v2 in library B should compile fine (the bytecode will change to
include the new signature).</p>
<p>In fact, if this was done in old good Java without anything fancy it would have
just worked, i.e. assuming the <code>copy</code> feature is implemented manually like this:</p>
<pre><code>// some.java
void doSomething(Shared arg) {
  Shared copy = new Shared();
  copy.st = "new-value";
  copy.b = arg.b;
  copy.l = arg.l;
  System.out.println(arg);
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, the verbose, naive, explicit, ugly Java version would not break
production as Kotlin did.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Just be careful when using <code>.copy()</code> especially when the data class is going to
be shared in a library.</p>
<p>This is nothing new (breaking prod because of incompatible library versions),
except that it sucks that the change is technically backward compatible.</p>
<p>Fancy language features are not magic and can come with nasty surprises.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/026_diode_array/">Diodes part 3: a working diode steering circuit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/021_more_diodes/">Diodes part 2: Homemade aluminium diodes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/011_copper_diodes/">Diodes part 1: Homemade copper diodes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019 I did my undergraduate thesis on the home-made ionic diodes that I've previously blogged about, with the hope of finding a way that some form of homemade (low-technology) ionic amplifying device could be devised.  I didn't succeed, but I found out about a whole pile of cool stuff.</p>

<p>For those not familiar: if you can make certain types of amplifying device (eg inverters) then you are most of the way to making devices that can do any computation.  Traditional IC technologies, like the many families of <span>CMOS, </span>are very performative but are a completely unapproachable technology for most students and experimenters ($$$$$+). You simply can't "make your own IC at home" -- the closest I have seen are people making some individual transistors (after lots of effort, investment in chemicals and furnaces).  You can also solder off-the-shelf parts onto a <span>PCB </span>to make an "IC", but this provides minimal educational value for actual IC development and has a wildly different list of tradeoffs.</p>

<p>The devices I looked at have absolutely garbage performance (speeds in single-digit Hz at best, lifetime in minutes) but also had some mild promises of achieving transistor-like functionality.  I still have hope that someone will devise a method of making home-technology ionic integrated circuits, but I never cracked the grail of transistor-like devices.</p>


<h2>Thesis download </h2>

<p><a href="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/Hales%20-%20Thesis%20B%20submission%202019%20(signatureremoved).pdf">My full thesis <span>PDF</span></a> goes into great detail of a variety of topics and experiments.  In this blog post I'm just going to summarise some more of the interesting things and show pretty pictures.</p>

<p>If any links to <span>PDF</span>s or other resources die (especially the 1920's magazines): please tell me, I have backup copies of everything.</p>

<p>There are lots of errors and informalities in my thesis, my passion isn't in formal writing and I'm a one man band.  Nonetheless I will appreciate it if you take the time to read my stuff and provide discussion, criticism or feedback. Keep in mind that many of my peers did their thesis entirely in simulation, I was lucky enough to be able to negotiate a topic that was much wilder and open-ended.</p>



<h2>Recreating the glow</h2>

<p>I managed to get the aluminium foil and bicarb soda diodes to glow!  Homemade kitchen-ingredient photon throwers, no fancy equipment required.</p>

<p>In this first image I have aluminium foil tape glowing inside a pool of electrolyte in a drinking glass.  (i) shows with power off, (ii) shows with 100VAC (50Hz) applied:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/glow%20even%20horiz.jpeg"></p>

<p>Very interestingly: my whitish glow colour was completely different to all of the literature which claimed it should be green.  </p>

<p>The full circuit is two back-to-back aluminium electrolyte diodes (see full thesis <span>PDF</span>), with the second electrode not within frame of the photos above. Lifetime was measured in hours if operated correctly, however they would slowly dim.</p>

<p>I adapted this from a drinking glass to a planar style with the goal of imitating IC-style construction.  Aluminium foil, sticky tape and a clear plastic slide (aka 'overhead transparency slide'):</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/films_small.jpeg" alt="" height="667" width="424"></p>

<p>Note the slightly different colours on the exposed sections of aluminium.  These are the oxide/hydroxide layers that grow after you put a drop of electrolyte (water + bicarb soda) on the contacts and slowly apply an AC voltage (starting from 0V, finishing somewhere around 100VAC).</p>

<p>This planar style also glowed reliably once I had some parameters down (mainly purer water).  Here is a photo taken through a cardboard tube, with a little bit of light leaking in around the edges.  Again (i) is power off and (ii) is with 100VAC+ applied:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/glow%20doublework.jpeg"></p>


<p>I have previously only been able to find <a href="http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/els/borax-el.htm">a single photo of this phenomena</a>.  I was pretty chuffed when it worked, more so when I found it repeatable :)</p>

<p>Mentions of this glow are otherwise mostly limited to 1920's magazines like (page 48 of <span>PDF</span>) <a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-News/20s/Radio-News-1926-08-R.pdf">Radio News for August 1926 'Chemical Condensers of Large Capacity' by Clyde J Fitch</a> and (page 29 of <span>PDF</span>) <a href="http://www.rsp-italy.it/Electronics/Magazines/QST/_contents/QST%201921_09.pdf"><span>QST</span> 1921 September 'Operating Notes on Electrolytic Rectifiers' by Roy Atkinson</a>.  </p>

<p>I made (and destroyed) a lot more of these devices than shown here.  They have many limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>dim, can't be seen in daylight</li>
<li>need about 100VAC (some literature claims much lower is possible, perhaps 30VAC?)</li>
<li>need very clean water ("demineralised" from a store should work well enough)</li>
<li>need to be formed with <span>AC, </span>but can then be run with DC (temporarily, until one of the aluminium contacts poisons and dims)</li>
<li>can't be used as part of a larger IC made using similar materials, as they require much greater than the breakdown voltage (of similar individual ionic diodes) to light.</li>
</ul>

<p>See my full thesis <span>PDF </span>for more chemistry, operations, theory &amp; history of these devices.</p>







<h2>Transistor proofs: methodology and misdirection</h2>

<p>I was really disappointed by a lot of sources.  Not just random websites or magazine articles: published papers didn't seem to be much better.</p>

<p>Ionic devices were mostly abandoned in the mid 1900's due to the advent of more promising solid-state technologies (like germanium &amp; silicon), so prior material on ionic devices is very sparse.  In recent years some more research has picked up, but many published papers and websites that initially show promise end up being useless for my goals, eg:</p>

<ul>
<li>Things that "transist" (change impedance) by some definition, but in ways that are useless for making chainable logic or even basic amplifiers.</li>
<li>Devices that look like they <em>might</em> amplify, but upon further inspection are actually something simpler (eg a resistive voltage divider).</li>
<li>Under-described experiments with miraculous results that no-one has managed to recreate, eg transistors made of nothing but ice and metal contacts.</li>
<li>Explanations that use words like 'cold fusion'.  Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 5 of my report is dedicated to questioning research and claims around ionic transistors.  If you have a good grasp of discrete transistor logic and discrete amplifiers then this may be amusing to read:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/part5-1.png"></p>

<p>I go into a lot of detail of what is and isn't useful in a transistor-like-device if you want to make logic circuits or amplifiers:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/figure20.png"></p>

<p>"This device is likely a transformer" is about as passive-aggressive insulting as I think I've ever been to a totally imaginary device.  Nonetheless it's very important to properly contemplate &amp; criticise all of these fictional examples, otherwise you end up accidentally convincing yourself that your have created a useful amplifier (like I did at one point with one of my experiments).</p>

<p>I was really eager to try and recreate an experiment by Letaw and Bardeen (minus the massive quantities of mercury, which for some reason my supervisor didn't want me to have).  Sadly in the end I realised that their own data didn't support their device actually being a useful or functional amplifier in any way (section 5.7.1).  I was pretty miffed.</p>



<h2>Alternative technologies for home-technology ICs</h2>

<p>It's always worth considering that your current path isn't the best path.</p>

<p>A lot of traditional transistor designs simply don't work at a macro-manageable scale, they need micron-thin insulators or active regions.  I explore scaling several of these ideas up to macro ('kitchen-technology') scale in section 6.2 of my report.  Interestingly: ionic transistor research (at the nano scale) has yielded working devices over the past few decades, so there are some less mainstream ideas worth trying to scale up from there too.</p>

<p>Chapter 8 of my thesis report outlines some crazier ideas to try.  Resonant tunnel-diode logic concepts could potentially make logic circuits out of the ionic diodes I already have (they have some funky behaviour when driven to higher voltages, including some hysteresis).  Bubble-control transistors are an idea where gas-bubble positions are abused to modulate fluid conductivity, ie turn the 'bad' electrolysis I get on my contacts into something useful):</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/trans3.jpeg" alt="" height="1050" width="1400"></p>

<p>Ideally I would avoid this whole wet-state-electronics concept, but it was the most promising path I had thanks to the working ionic diodes I had previously developed.</p>



<h2>Pretty construction methods and various oddities</h2>

<p>Making a single functional diode was possible with a (relatively unreactive) coin, sticky-tape, aluminium foil, bicarb soda and water:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/coin.JPG" alt="" height="400" width="497"></p>

<p>The above shows an over-saturated solution (white).  My later tests used much more controlled concentrations, so the fluids appear as transparent water instead:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/interdig_1_small.jpeg" alt="" height="754" width="612"></p>

<p>Interdigitated gold electrodes were made on clear slide transparency (ie the clear A4-sized pieces of plastic you print onto for overhead projectors).  The fingers are made of gold-leaf foil (very cheap) and double-sided tape. Cheap kapton clone tape was used as an insulator.  Ordinary clear sticky-tape works just as well, but I found photo examples were easier to make with the coloured kapton:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/trans4.jpeg" alt="" height="657" width="840"></p>

<p>Note that the two sets of gold contacts shown above are slightly different colours.  The photographed specimen had been used under DC conditions, which affected each electrode differently.</p>

<p>I didn't have automated sampling equipment in my primary lab (ie my home), so the actual test jigs looked a lot more primitive then you might expect:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/dmm_array.jpeg" alt="" height="1000" width="1563"></p>

<p>I also followed some tangents into making the other components of ICs, such as resistors, using easily available materials and methods that were somewhat analogous to actual IC masking processes.  Here is an example using a mixture of tube-silicone (used on gutters &amp; bathrooms) and powdered graphite (used as lock lubricant) to make resistors:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/maskup_small.jpeg" alt="" height="424" width="786"> </p>

<p>These resistors were pressure sensitive, so I imagine they could make interesting sensors.  Depending on graphite concentration and track geometry I was able to get anything from hundreds of ohms to megaohms:</p>

<p><img src="https://halestrom.net/darksleep/blog/043_diodes4/subs_resistors_small.jpeg" alt="" height="671" width="693"></p>

<p>Mal-forming the oxide/hydroxide layers on aluminium contacts would lead to …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://paperless.blog/2009/12/25/vcard-parser-and-validator/">vCard 3.0 validator</a> is ten years old. The standard has moved on, Python has moved on, and I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two as a developer. But I'm not working on any vCard validators, and probably won't be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system syndrome</a>, but I've tried to reboot the project at least three times now. The Python code isn't very elegant, fast or well tested. I set up skeletons in <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard/tree/master/javcard">Java version</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard-rust">Rust</a>, both excellent languages. I tried defining an <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">ANTLR grammar</a>. But I've got nothing to show for any of that. The main problem is motivation: vCard 3, 4 and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a> are incredibly out of date, to the point where writing a parser is equal parts painful and boring.</p>
<p><img src="https://paperless.blog/assets/images/standards.png" alt="standards" width="500" height="283"></p>
<p>And now, because the Internet needs more opinions (and standards): a human friendly address card format is possible. vCard/jCard is not it. When someone brave and tenacious enough to take this on comes around, I really hope they take at least the following into account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a <strong>popular, existing serialization format.</strong> JSON won in this space. It's not perfect, but it's here to stay and it's a good compromise between human and machine readable.</li>
    <li>Don't create another jCard. If you were developing the world's first address card format, what would users and developers want to see?</li>
    <li>Conversely, vCard did many things right. <strong>UTF-8, base64 and ISO dates</strong> are definitely good things.</li>
    <li>All caps is hard to read. Don't shout.</li>
    <li>Don't limit (or even recommend) a line length or line splitting scheme. Address cards shouldn't be inlined into emails or documents any more than CSV files.</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> (as in associated key/value pairs) are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Lists</strong> are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred name</strong> should probably be the only required name field.</li>
    <li><strong>Time zones are not UTC offsets.</strong> I do not live in time zone "+12:00", because that offset changes twice per year. I live in time zone "Pacific/Auckland". This can be the difference between being on time and wasting everybody's time.</li>
    <li>Allow <strong>linking to photos.</strong> Sure URLs are ephemeral, but so is basically everything in an address card.</li>
    <li><strong>Any property not in the standard should simply be ignored,</strong> as long as the entire document is still a valid instance of the serialization format.</li>
    <li><strong>Internationalization and localization</strong> are complex but important.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will such a standard look like? Maybe something like this will be possible:</p>
<pre>{
    "preferred name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": {
        "cell": ["+99 9999-9999", "+11 0000 0000"],
        "home": "+99 9999-9999"
    },
    "URL": {
        "blog": "https://…",
        "work": ["https://example.org/", "https://example.com/"]
    },
    "photo": "https://…",
    "my custom property": "…",
    "time zone": "Pacific/Auckland"
}
</pre>

        <p>
          Did you ever wonder how 3D engines render objects on the screen? Or how graphics APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX are written? This course is a complete immersion on how CPU-based 3D engines work. We will use C to develop a complete 3D engine from scratch, pixel by pixel, triangle per triangle. This is a basic course that requires no prior knowledge, but you will probably make the most of it if you know already the basics of programming.

                  <p>Been waiting for a course like this for years.  A lot of the theory of 3d graphics is availablein books and online , but none that put it into practice in such a clear way (if at all) . Also using C which I am more comfortable using than OOP (i'm a bit old school) .  It is a great refresher on C too, its a big project so far (only a bout 1/3 of the way through), but loving it so far.  </p>

I liked that the math and actual algorithms were discussed before implementing them and student own problem solving opportunity was encouraged throughout. This course has enabled me to fill in the critical gaps in some of the most important fundamental concepts in 3d graphics programming. Hope to see more!! Thank you.</p>

I bought it because I want to support those kind of materials! I basically learned all this stuff by myself through books and articles, but this course is a all in one place to learn them all at once, in a fun/approachable and motivating way that will make you save some precious time. Even if this is a good refresher for me and I already had the "clicks" before, I'll recommend it for anyone wanting to become a graphics/game/programmer !</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Every year on Christmas day,
the Ruby core team release
a new version of Ruby.
And this year,
it’s a big one -
Ruby 3.0 was just released!
The big new features this time are
support for static analysis
and the new concurrency features.
Here are some of the highlights
of this release.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-and-types">Ruby and types</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">RBS</a></strong>
is the new language
for describing types in Ruby programs.
Type checkers like
<a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/soutaro/steep">Steep</a>
or the newly introduced
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/typeprof">TypeProf</a>
can use these types
to statically analyze the program.
Here’s a simple example taken from RBS docs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Actual code</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>attr_reader</span> <span>:login</span><span>,</span> <span>:email</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>login</span><span>:,</span> <span>email</span><span>:)</span>
    <span>@login</span><span>,</span> <span>@email</span> <span>=</span> <span>login</span><span>,</span> <span>email</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># RBS</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>attr_reader</span> <span>login: </span><span>String</span>
  <span>attr_reader</span> <span>email: </span><span>String</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>login: </span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>email: </span><span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A new static type analyzer called
<strong><a href="https://github.com/ruby/typeprof">TypeProf</a></strong>
is now included with Ruby.
To illustrate a very simple example,
consider the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>foo</span>
  <span>'bar'</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Running <code>typeprof -v foo.rb</code>
will generate the following output,
pointing out that
you’re sending an argument
to a method that doesn’t accept any.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Errors
test.rb:5: [error] wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0)

# Classes
class Object
  private
  def foo: -&gt; String
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="ractors">Ractors</h3>

<p>Ruby’s global interpreter lock (GVL)
has stopped Ruby from
being able to use multiple cores in parallel.
To work around this,
a new actor-like concurrency primitive has been introduced,
called <code>Ractor</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example from the docs,
showing how message passing works with ractors.
You can find more examples in the
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/doc/ractor.md">Ractor docs</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r1</span><span>,</span> <span>r2</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>2</span><span>).</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span>
    <span>n</span><span>.</span><span>prime?</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>r1</span><span>.</span><span>send</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>61</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span>
<span>r2</span><span>.</span><span>send</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>61</span> <span>+</span> <span>15</span>

<span>p</span> <span>r1</span><span>.</span><span>take</span> <span>#=&gt; true</span>
<span>p</span> <span>r2</span><span>.</span><span>take</span> <span>#=&gt; true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rightward-assignment">Rightward assignment</h3>

<p>Experimental support has been added
for rightward assignment.
You can use <code>=&gt;</code> to assign
to a variable on the right,
but I can’t think of a reason
to use this over simple assignment.
However, this can be useful
for pattern matching
values in of arrays and hashes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>42</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span># same as x = 42</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span> <span>}</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>b: </span><span>foo</span> <span>}</span>
<span>foo</span> <span>#=&gt; 2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="find-pattern-matching">Find pattern matching</h3>

<p>Pattern matching syntax has been extended
to allow extracting elements from an array.
Here’s a simple example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>'c'</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>'d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'f'</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pre</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>post</span><span>]</span>
  <span>pre</span>  <span>#=&gt; ["a", 1]</span>
  <span>x</span>    <span>#=&gt; "b"</span>
  <span>y</span>    <span>#=&gt; "c"</span>
  <span>post</span> <span>#=&gt; [2, "d", "e", "f", 3]</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="endless-method-definition">Endless method definition</h3>

<p>New syntax has been added
that allows you to skip the <code>end</code>
when the method body
contains a single expression.
When you need to extract
a one-line method in your code,
this concise syntax will come in handy.</p>



<h3 id="leading-args-in-argument-forwarding">Leading args in argument forwarding</h3>

<p>Ruby 2.7 introduced argument forwarding
with <code>...</code> syntax.
However, you might want to access the leading arguments
and forward the rest.
Now the syntax has been updated to allow this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>method_missing</span><span>(</span><span>method_name</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>nil</span> <span>unless</span> <span>method_name</span><span>.</span><span>in?</span><span>(</span><span>allowed_methods</span><span>)</span>

  <span>object</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method_name</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="hash">Hash</h3>

<p><strong><code>Hash#transform_keys</code></strong> has been updated
to accepts an argument
which lets you define which keys should be renamed.
You can also pass a block
which will be used to transform the remaining keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>note</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>title: </span><span>'Ruby 3.0'</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at: </span><span>'2020-12-25'</span> <span>}</span>

<span># without block</span>
<span>note</span><span>.</span><span>transform_keys</span><span>({</span> <span>created_at: :created</span> <span>})</span>
<span># =&gt; { title: 'Ruby 3.0', created: '2020-12-25' }</span>

<span># with block</span>
<span>note</span><span>.</span><span>transform_keys</span><span>({</span> <span>created_at: </span><span>'created'</span> <span>},</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>:to_s</span><span>)</span>
<span># =&gt; { 'title' =&gt; 'Ruby 3.0', 'created' =&gt; '2020-12-25' }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong><code>Hash#except</code></strong> which has been available
in Rails through ActiveSupport
is now included in the language itself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span> <span>}</span>
<span>x</span><span>.</span><span>except</span><span>(</span><span>:c</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; { a: 1, b: 2 }</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="performance-goals-aka-ruby-3x3">Performance goals, aka Ruby 3x3</h3>

<p>In 2015, Matz annnounce
that Ruby 3 will be 3 times as fast
compared to Ruby 2.0
(aka the 3x3 goal).
The <a href="https://github.com/mame/optcarrot">optcarrot benchmark</a>.
has long been used
for comparing different versions of Ruby,
and with JIT enabled,
3.0 did indeed reach the 3x goal.</p>

<p>MJIT is still not mature,
and not all programs
can take advantage of the speedup.
Rails apps, for instance,
actually perform worse
with JIT enabled.
However, this is still great news
for CPU bound programs.
With newly introduced concurrency features,
the biggest performance wins from this release
will be seen later on
as more libraries make use of these features.</p>

<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>

<p>This post only covers
some of the features
that I found the most interesting
in this release.
If you want to read further,

and the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v3_0_0/NEWS.md">changelog</a>
have more details.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html">Ruby References</a>
page for Ruby 3.0
is the most comprehensive
list of all the new features,
and contains more details
and code examples.</p>

Because of this increase, the energy use of that increasing computational power is growing immensely. For example, so much energy is used by modern day data centers that some are built near rivers so that the flowing water can be used to cool the machinery.</p><p>“The digital communications infrastructure that supports the Information Age that we live in today currently uses approximately 10% of the global electricity. Studies suggest that in the worst case scenario, if there is no fundamental change in the underlying technology of our communications infrastructure such as the computing hardware in large data centers or the electronics that drive the communication networks, we may see its electricity usage rise to over 50% of the global electricity by 2030,” says Christopher Ayala, an associate professor at Yokohama National University, and lead author of the study.</p><p>The team’s research, published in the following Journal:<i> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fdocument%2F9295318&amp;t=YmQxMzYzNmI1OTYwMjY0NjBkYTljODRiZDFjODZjYzg5OGY5YTc1OCx2cUVPMmV5VA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638879481021464576%2Fnew-microprocessor-energy-savings&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609563161">IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits</a></i>, details an effort to develop a more energy efficient microprocessor architecture using superconductors, devices that are incredibly efficient, but require certain environmental conditions to operate.</p><p>To tackle this power problem, the team explored the use of an extremely energy-efficient superconductor digital electronic structure, called the adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP), as a building block for ultra-low-power, high-performance microprocessors, and other computing hardware for the next generation of data centers and communication networks.</p><p>“In this paper, we wanted to prove that the AQFP is capable of practical energy-efficient high-speed computing, and we did this by developing and successfully demonstrating a prototype 4-bit AQFP microprocessor called MANA (Monolithic Adiabatic iNtegration Architecture), the world’s first adiabatic superconductor microprocessor,” said Ayala.</p><figure data-orig-width="644" data-orig-height="685"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/aeb6503d319f9e47625fab76bff4c7a9/4023cdf87d653902-ad/s1280x1920/018d27e7749f2589ad5ef21b354987f954a1fa20.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="644" data-orig-height="685" width="644" height="685"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;AQFP MANA microprocessor die photo.

We also show on a separate chip that the data processing part of the microprocessor can operate up to a clock frequency of 2.5 GHz making this on par with today’s computing technologies. We even expect this to increase to 5-10 GHz as we make improvements in our design methodology and our experimental setup,” Ayala said.</p><p>However, superconductors require extremely cool temperatures to operate successfully. One would think that if you factor in the cooling required for a superconductor microprocessor, the energy requirement would become undesirable and surpass current day microprocessors. But according to the research team this, surprisingly, was not the case:</p><p>“The AQFP is a superconductor electronic device, which means that we need additional power to cool our chips from room temperature down to 4.2 Kelvin to allow the AQFPs to go into the superconducting state. But even when taking this cooling overhead into account, the AQFP is still about 80 times more energy-efficient when compared to the state-of-the-art semiconductor electronic devices found in high-performance computer chips available today.”</p><p>Now that the team has proven the concept of this superconductor chip architecture, they plan to optimize the chip and determine the chip’s scalability and speed post optimization.</p><p>“We are now working towards making improvements in the technology, including the development of more compact AQFP devices, increasing the operation speed, and increasing the energy-efficiency even further through reversible computation,” Ayala said. “We are also scaling our design approach so that we can fit as many devices as possible in a single chip and operate all of them reliably at high clock frequencies.”</p><p>In addition to building standard microprocessors, the team is also interested in examining how AQFPs could assist in other computing applications such as neuromorphic computing hardware for artificial intelligence as well as quantum computing applications.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-12%2Fynu-eee122820.php&amp;t=MDA1ZTcyMDU5ZjFiMGNiNmUzMmMzMjhlMzkzODJmYzQ0OGZlNzRjZix2cUVPMmV5VA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638879481021464576%2Fnew-microprocessor-energy-savings&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609563161">Yokohama National University</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“MANA: A Monolithic Adiabatic iNtegration Architecture Microprocessor Using 1.4-zJ/op Unshunted Superconductor Josephson Junction Devices”,&nbsp;<i>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1109%2FJSSC.2020.3041338&amp;t=MzQyZDY2ZTQ0OWVjYTlmMGFkNzE5MTNjNmVmNTBhMTQwODJmNjcyZSx2cUVPMmV5VA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638879481021464576%2Fnew-microprocessor-energy-savings&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609563161">https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2020.3041338</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/634063638600286208/computer-chip-logic-operations-data-storage">A computer chip that combines logic operations and data storage</a></p>

December 29, 2020 | https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/is-web-dead/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.aesthetic.com/blog/is-web-dead/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><p>When mobile apps entered the scene in the early 2010s, sensationalist industry pundits exclaimed, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff-webrip/">the web is dead!</a>”. A large debate ensued about the role of the web and native apps, and people loved talking about which one would prevail. A decade later it’s clear that the answer is, “both”. It turns out, they weren’t competing in a zero sum game.</p><p>With social media’s rise, we’re now in round 2 of the, “web is dead” argument. There’s a whole new generation of internet users for whom the internet is their social media apps. In the same way that baby boomers viewed the browser as the internet, to Gen Z <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/gen-z-the-future-of-the-internet-and-social-platforms">social media is the internet</a>. This isn’t a surprise when looking at recent time spent metrics, but a less obvious and perhaps more consequential shift is happening underneath it all: content creation. </p><p>We estimate that content creation is happening today at roughly 100x the velocity in social media’s walled gardens as it is on the web at large. While there are still <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/">100,000+ websites being created each week</a>, there are <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-statistics/">100,000,000+ social posts being created</a> across the likes of Instagram, Tiktok and Snapchat. The vast majority of this social content is both temporal (it goes away) and opaque to the rest of the web at large. Social media content is invisible to the web, and is growing far faster. This presents a big risk to the web.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html">core tenet of the open internet</a> is that content can be accessed by any device with a network connection. There are protocols and open standards in place that ensure the web stays accessible, and there are massive communities of people whose entire focus is making sure that this vision stays true. However, social media sidesteps all of this and creates its own private ecosystem of content that is only accessible by using a closed protocol (ie, Instagram’s app). This gives them massive control and influence over how and what people discover, and it also means that the open web has a massive hole in it.</p><p>As a content creator today, it’s more important than ever to decide where your allegiances live. What is your primary content creation mechanism, and what channels do you use to distribute it? How does the channel influence the content that you create, and which audience is the most valuable to you and your stakeholders? </p><p>The biggest issue with this new flavor of the web is that the content creators don’t actually own the content they create. Whereas in the open web people host their own content that’s discovered through aggregators like Google, now the content hosting and discovery are bundled together. This means that creators are even more beholden to these platforms and are at risk of having their audience taken away from them. We’ve all read <a href="https://w3-lab.com/social-media/instagram-declining-reach-trends-2020/">horror stories</a> about creators who spent years building an audience, only to have their engagement drop overnight because a platform changed their ranking algorithm to prioritize a new type of content. </p><p>Content creators are more empowered than ever to produce content that reaches their audience, but with this change they are also more captive to the platforms that feed them. This is true for anyone that participates in the social media circus, whether as an individual consumer, creator or a business. </p><p>If the last decade has been a bundling of content creation and distribution, the next decade will be a disaggregation of these two equally important functions. Instead of creators creating content directly within a distribution platform, they will create and host it independently and then syndicate it through their platforms of choice. </p><p>Social media companies are already creating new ways to incentivize content creators to publish on their platform, like what we’ve seen from <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-the-200-million-tiktok-creator-fund">TikTok</a> and now <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spotlight-on-snapchat/">Snapchat</a>. These incentive structures are attractive at first glance, but also don’t prevent creators from porting their content elsewhere. What will be the open web equivalent of Instagram Stories or TikTok? Google has an opinion on this with <a href="https://amp.dev/about/stories/">AMP Stories</a>, but unfortunately these just end up being, “yet another” thing for creators to think about with no clear payoff outside of large media companies today. </p><p>In the future every creator will have their own content management system that publishes to the web at large, and cross-posts variants of that content to their distribution channels of choice. This has <a href="https://jamstack.org/">already happened with websites</a>, but will continue to grow in use for other formats as well. CMS can be used for many things beyond websites, like <a href="https://unity.com/how-to/simplify-your-content-management-addressables">plugging into gaming engines</a> or <a href="https://www.aesthetic.com/">auto-generating social media assets</a>. Content authoring and content distribution are two sides of the same coin, but don’t have to be coupled. </p><p>At Aesthetic, we’re on the first leg of this journey by helping companies repurpose their website content into social media content. In effect, we’re letting companies tap into their existing CMS to generate social content for all of the platforms they care about. We believe that this is a trend that will continue to play out over time and that will become far more commonplace over the coming years. A higher percentage of the content on social media will be ported from the open web, and used as a bridge to connect creators’ ideas into all of the places that their audiences spend time. </p><p>If you share this vision for the future, <a href="https://www.aesthetic.com/">sign up to get access</a> to Aesthetic today! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Computers eat data in binary, that’s a fact, even if we have a text file the computer treats it as binary, zeros and ones. We can agree that binary serialization is the best in terms of disk space and load/save speed. But, what about the quality of life of using them? What about the time needed to add or create new functionality for such files? And the bugs and hard debugging that binary load/saving can give you…</p>



<p>I think that in some cases is best to just stick to text files, at least until other format is needed. It provides several benefits that from my point of view are underestimated.</p>



<h2><strong>Example</strong></h2>



<p>When I was designing the engine for my Junior year at DigiPen Bilbao, the engine that then would run <a href="https://borjaportugal.com/portfolio/teotl-rise-of-a-god/">Teotl – Rise of a God</a>. I wanted to achieve fast iteration time in content creation, this is why I decided to implement hot reloading of resources, which allowed us to see the results of data changes instantly in the engine. If an artist changed a model or texture it would see the change in the running game at the moment.</p>



<p>On top of that, I wanted to achieve fast development time of engine/game features. For this, I decided to avoid implementing some tools and functionality to avoid having to invest the time it would take to develop them in first place and then improving and/or bug-fixing over the duration of the project. <strong>One of the features that we didn’t implement was an Entity Editor.</strong> As we where storing the data in Json format, thanks to the hot reloading of the Resource Manager we could iterate fast on the creation of entities.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1837" data-permalink="https://borjaportugal.com/2020/05/03/text-files-are-understimated/live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god/" data-orig-file="https://borjaportugal.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god.gif" data-orig-size="1529,706" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://borjaportugal.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://borjaportugal.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god.gif?w=736" src="https://borjaportugal.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god.gif" alt="live_edit_teotl_rise_of_a_god"><figcaption>When the text file changes the engine reloads the resource and the changes are visualized live.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This choice might seem as lazy, but indeed we didn’t miss this feature at all. Most of the times is not scalable but for us, having limited time to develop a full 3D engine and game, it was a good choice. <strong>A text editor did the job, we didn’t have to spend time working on it and it was 100% reliable, it didn’t crash even once 🙂</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Outsourcing functionality to text editors</strong></h2>



<p>Developing cool tools with cutting edge features is very tempting, I’m always looking for some challenges in my day to day programming. But the truth is that the more cutting edge we try to do something the more time it will take, more code will be needed, more potential for bugs. If we need to create some UI for this feature, we also need to make sure that is intuitive and easy to use for end users.</p>



<p>On the other hand, using text files to represent our data allow us to use them as our editors, inheriting all their features:</p>



<p><strong>* Search:</strong> Instead of creating a database, a text file and Search functionality in text editor does the job (most text editors support regex and other fancy ways of searching, no need to go through the headache of implementing them yourself! : )</p>



<p><strong>* Find and Replace:</strong> Easy to update data.</p>



<p><strong>* Stats:</strong> By using the search functionality you can find out how many times a text appears in the file. That “text” could be the name of a property, the path to a resource… Visual Studio Code highlights on the search bar where the occurrences are, this can also give you data (i.e. in a file where you have a dump of all your levels, you can find out how often a specific mesh is used across levels).</p>

I’ll just use Ctrl+F”</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<blockquote><p>We inherit all benefits of text editors! By default!</p><cite>Mike Acton likes things “by default” <sup><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/u8B3j8rqYMw" target="_blank">1</a></sup></cite></blockquote>



<p>All of the above happens by default, without any extra work required from us or any other person in our team. To make it even better, we also get these benefits:</p>



<ul><li>Minor or no need to learn how to use the editor (people is already knows how to use text editors).</li><li>Bug free (hopefully).</li><li>Free lifetime updates with new features they add to the editor that can be handy.</li></ul>



<p>These might sound like they are not much, but taking into account we get them without spending any of our time, they are worth considering.</p>



<h2><strong>Building ‘true’ standalone tools</strong></h2>



<p>Storing the data in binary format makes it tied to the program/API that is producing the data, this means that custom tools we build to work with our data will only work with that, fullstop. It can be “generic” in the context of the project we are working on, but it will be “specific” to that project in the context of other projects.</p>



<p>As programmers we are always looking for ways to make our code as standalone as possible, looking for re-usability. By having our data as text we can build custom tools to search, update, find statistics, etc; that latter can be reused in any other place, because we are just building tools to work with text.</p>



<h3>Batch files</h3>



<p>Sometimes we need to perform operations on several files or even all our files and doing it by hand (in a text editor) is not an option. In those cases we can create some simple batch file that performs the needed operation in all the files we want. By doing this we again have more tools at our disposal like findstr or grep. Once again, by default!</p>



<p><strong>This batch files could be latter reused on other projects, it doesn’t matter if they use plain text, xml, json… they just work with text.</strong></p>



<h3>Programs</h3>



<p>In case we need a more custom operation, we can always create a simple program that would perform it. This program <del>can</del> should be completely standalone from our project, it could be written to work with plain strings or using the API for the format we use (i.e. json/xml). This tools work just with some data and the operations they perform can be reused across any project, it can be a game, an emulator, some other tools or even it could be used to work with code! Isn’t it great?</p>



<h2><strong>Real World Example</strong></h2>



<p>Naugty Dogs uses a lot of text files to develop multiple of their features (i.e. dialog system, animation metadata…).</p>



<p>This saves work on the programmers side because there are no tools to be developed. It might seem like the quality of life of users is decreased because they don’t have a UI to work with, but the truth is that having no tool also means avoiding crashes and potentially loosing work.</p>



<p>If you are interested in this topic, Jason Gregory, exlains how their dialoges are created using Scheme in his book <a href="https://www.gameenginebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Engine Architecture <sup>2</sup></a>. Additionaly, you can see a brief mention of Scheme sintax and how they use it in this talk: <a rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/gpINOFQ32o0?t=309" target="_blank">HandmadeCon 2016 – Large-scale Systems Architecture <sup>3</sup></a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes, rather than spending a lot of time thinking on how to build some new tool, is worth asking the question “Would a simple text file do the job?”, if the answer is “Yes” we have the opportunity to save time and open a huge range of possibilities.</p>



<p>I think that most of the times we overlook text files as a viable option, maybe is because using text files feels “naive”, maybe is because the dream idea we have in mind blinds us. We can always find thousands of unrealistic scenarios where “a text file won’t work”, we are always looking for answers to the <em>“What if…”</em> question that will reasure us that we need a super custom fancy tool. <em>“What if…</em></p>



<ul><li><em>… we have too much data? It will be slow.”</em></li><li><em>… we want to compare values? A text file can only search exact matches. Using regex is difficult.”</em></li><li><em>… we mess up the format of the data with a find and replace?”</em></li><li>…</li></ul>



<p>My experience tells me that most of the <em>“What if…”</em> questions we make ourselves don’t turn out to happen, instead, other new problems arise and they need to be solved afterwards. I’ve found the features provided by text editors very useful along my career, if the problem needs a more complex solution, starting with text files as intermediate step shows if an other solution is really needed <sup><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/cV5HArLYajE?t=250" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The separation which <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">started in 2.7</a> with deprecations, is now fully finished. It means  keyword arguments are not a “syntax sugar” on top of hashes, and they never converted into each other implicitly:</p>

<h3 id="arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">Arguments forwarding (<code>...</code>) supports leading arguments<a href="#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments"></a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Argument forwarding, when <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">introduced in 2.7</a>, was able to forward only all-or-nothing. It turned out to be not enough. One of the important usages for leading arguments are cases like <code>method_missing</code> and other DSL-defined methods that need to pass to the nested method <code>:some_symbol</code> + all of the original arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16378">Feature #16378</a></li>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“all arguments splat” <code>...</code> should be the last statement in the argument list (both on a declaration and a call)</li>
      <li>on a method declaration, arguments before <code>...</code> can only be positional (not keyword) arguments, and can’t have default values (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>on a method call, arguments passed before <code>...</code> can’t be keyword arguments (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>make sure to check your punctuation thoroughly, because <code>anything ...</code> is a syntax for endless range, those constructs are valid syntax, but would do not what is expected:
        <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegates</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># call without "()" -- actually parsed as (p()...)</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>...</span>
  <span># Prints nothing, but warns: warning: ... at EOL, should be parenthesized?</span>

  <span># "," accidentally missing after 1, there is just one argument: 1...</span>
  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># Prints "1..."</span>

  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># Prints, as expected:</span>
  <span>#   1</span>
  <span>#   5</span>

</ul>

<h3 id="endless-method-definition">“Endless” method definition<a href="#endless-method-definition"></a></h3>

<p>Methods of exactly one statement now can be defined with syntax <code>def method() = statement</code>. (The syntax doesn’t need <code>end</code>, hence the “endless definition” moniker.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Ruby’s <code>end</code>s (unlike C-like languages’ <code>{}</code>) are generally OK for Rubyists, but make small utility methods look more heavy than they should. For small utility methods with body containing just one short statement like:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>available?</span>
  <span>!</span><span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span>

  <li><strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The initial proposal seems to be a good-natured April Fool’s joke, then everybody suddenly liked it, and, with a slight change of syntax, it was accepted;</li>
      <li>Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, but it does NOT produce a warning, it is deliberate, see discussion in <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17399">Misc #17399</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Pattern matching, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#pattern-matching">introduced in 2.7</a>, is no longer experimental.</strong> Discussion: <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>.</p>

<h4 id="one-line-pattern-matching-with-">One-line pattern matching with <code>=&gt;</code><a href="#one-line-pattern-matching-with-"></a></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> This is an interesting one. Two facts were discussed between 2.7 and 3.0: the fact that in most of the other languages one-line pattern matching has a different order (<code>&lt;pattern&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;data&gt;</code>) than introduced in Ruby 2.7 (<code>&lt;data&gt; in &lt;pattern&gt;</code>); and the idea of “rightward assignment operator” <code>=&gt;</code> for more natural chaining. And then, at some point, ideas converged most fruitfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>  (main pattern matching tracking ticket), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16670">Feature #16670</a>  (reverse order), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15921">Feature #15921</a>  (standalone rightward assignment operator), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15799">Feature #15799</a>  (abandoned “pipeline operator” idea, in discussion of which “rightward assignment” was born)</li>

      <li>Feature is marked as EXPERIMENTAL, will warn so on an attempt of usage, and may change in the future;</li>
      <li>But simple assignment usage (<code>data =&gt; variable</code>) is <strong>not</strong> considered experimental and is here to stay;</li>
      <li>One quirk that might be non-obvious: pattern matching can desconstruct-assign only to local variables, so when using <code>=&gt;</code> as an assignment operator, you will see those are syntax errors:
        <div><div><pre><code><span>some_statement</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>@x</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-51d739718c878a67ca0e"><div><p>"What is the main goal of a DevRel team?" is a question I've heard for years, and every time, the answer starts with "well... it depends!" What if I told you that the main goal of DevRel -- no matter what company you're at -- is to support the company's empowerment of the developer community?</p><p>From this understanding comes awareness of your products (speaking at conferences or writing up best practices), enabling your audience (getting started guides and tutorials), and engagement (making community members feel welcome and included). From this singular goal, you can more easily see where you fit into the broader tapestry of your company's goals and objectives for the weeks, months, and years ahead. The end result? A stable Developer Relations team that can easily point to the value they're bringing to the community as well as the company.</p><h2>Metrics to Track (Wrong Answers Only)</h2><p>In amidst all of those “well… it depends!” answers, you’ll likely hear some of the following answers when asking people what the primary metric is for a Developer Relations team:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Social Media Statistics</p></li><li><p>Number of Downloads</p></li><li><p>Number of Talks Given or Tutorials Written</p></li><li><p>What Gaps You’ve Filled (e.g. Technical Support Staff for the Community Forum, Events Management, Social Media Management, Project Manager for Product or Engineering Teams, etc.)</p></li></ul><p>I should note that these things aren’t necessarily bad in and of themselves, but they’re not enough to prove the value, and more importantly, the impact of your work. There needs to be a larger story attached to them.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, tracking social media statistics like Twitter followers or GitHub stars doesn’t tell you anything about the actual engagement from the community or who they are. Download metrics don’t tell you whether the people who downloaded your platform are still using it or whether they were able to successfully solve their problems. These metrics quickly become what we call <strong>vanity metrics</strong>: items that are easy to track but don’t often speak to the larger business value of the work you’re doing.</p><p><strong>Work output </strong>is the second category of metrics that are typically tracked. While tracking how many blogposts, tutorials, or talks your team can accomplish in a single quarter can be helpful in figuring out a good work cadence for your team, once again, delivering these metrics to your senior leadership doesn’t speak to the <em>impact</em> that this work has had on the company or the community. All of the awareness, enablement, or engagement that you’ve worked toward with these tasks (the truly important things) is left by the side as you emphasize to management just how much work you were able to accomplish.</p><p>This last category of metrics often isn’t explicitly defined, but can simply occur as companies try to figure out where a DevRel team best fits within the company. Do we belong in Marketing? Product? Customer Success? <strong>Filling gaps </strong>from other teams is often an easy way for the company to justify the expense of a DevRel department. Is the team able to handle all of the technical support questions that come into the forum from the free or open source community members? Do they handle all of the events management and staffing for developer-facing events? Perhaps they run the developer-centric social media accounts for the company or help the Product and Engineering teams with project management tasks. While all of these tasks are important (and sometimes fall under the purview of Developer Relations), none of them highlight the unique qualities that DevRel professionals bring to the table.</p><h2>Finding the Right Goals</h2><p>So if those are the <em>wrong</em> answers… what is the goal of a Developer Relations team? It turns out, “It Depends” isn’t always a bad answer! Your end goal will depend on which audience your company is focused on, what stage your company is at, and what the maturity of your product is, but there is a question you can answer that will solve most of these problems for you.</p><p><em>How can we help our colleagues, using our own unique talents to support their goals,<br>while still providing value to the community?</em></p><p>In order to successfully prove the value of our work in a way that the company understands and sees as beneficial, we need to attach the main goals of the Developer Relations department to the goals that are shared by the company as a whole. Let’s break this down…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This work has to be done in a way the company understands</strong>. It needs to be related to the work that another team is doing in a support capacity (e.g. helping to build out a social media presence with a technical audience) or in a way that actively furthers the company vision (e.g. collecting feedback from trusted community members which will help shape the product roadmap).</p><p><strong>This work needs to be seen as beneficial</strong>.<em> </em>What is the impact of the work that you’ve done? It’s not just enough to answer questions on Stack Overflow that are related to your product. After all, Engineering, Technical Support, or Product could likely do that as well. But if you can spot patterns and trends throughout the tech industry while spending time engaging with your community on Stack Overflow, you’re then able to bring your unique perspective back to the company. This information can then be used by Marketing to create additional content, Product to decide on the best way forward with a new feature, and even Sales to highlight new use cases during their calls with prospects.</p><p><strong>The work that we’re doing needs to be attached to the team goals, which then point to the broader company goals</strong><em>. </em>This is where we go back to the three-part goal of awareness, enablement, and engagement. Is your company trying to raise its ARR? Finding ways to increase developer awareness of your product through speaking engagements, unique tutorials, or syndicated content is just one way to increase traffic to your site. Perhaps they’re attempting to reduce churn. By focusing on developer experience, you can ensure that developers are having a great experience from the start. When this is followed by a great experience with your community, customers are that much more inclined to stick around a while longer!&nbsp;</p><h2>The Big Question</h2><p>This brings us back to the big question I referenced earlier:</p><p><em>How can we help our colleagues, using our own unique talents to support their goals,<br>while still providing value to the community?</em></p><p>This is a big question because it requires us to actually know what our unique talents are! What do we bring to the table that sets us apart from the other departments? What value do we bring to the company as well as the community that other people aren’t able to achieve?</p><p>Here are a few examples:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Gather community opinions and translate them into actionable feedback that the Product and Engineering teams can benefit from</p></li><li><p>Connect with community members one-on-one and start a relationship that’s going to keep them coming back to day after day, even if they do run into issues</p></li><li><p>Make introductions between community members and our coworkers that bring significant value back to other teams (see also: <a href="https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2019/12/14/devrel-qualified-leads-repurposing-a-common-business-metrics-to-prove-value"><span>DevRel Qualified Leads</span></a>)</p></li></ul><p>What’s important is that we find these unique qualities that set us apart as we engage with our communities. These qualities allow us to further our co-worker’s goals as well as our company’s goals while still providing that tremendous value back to our community at the end of the day.</p><h2>Libby Boxes: Let’s Get Practical</h2><p><a href="https://glennremoreras.com/tag/libby-boxes/"><span>Libby Boxes</span></a>, a predictive framework popularized by Cornell Accounting Professor Robert Libby, allow us to draw directly from the company objectives all the way down to the specific work output we’re working toward during a specific sprint (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.). This helps the DevRel team ensure they’re working toward common company goals while still serving the community (which is our <a href="https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2019/5/22/what-is-developer-relations-and-why-should-you-care"><span>top priority</span></a> at the end of the day). It also gives senior leadership a way to see the direct impact the DevRel team is having on the company and reinforces our value internally as well as externally.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607980404342_43459"><p>The top row of boxes is for the concepts or ideas that you’re working toward. Once these more general ideas are identified, you’re able to move to the lower boxes where you’ll start to think more tactically about what initiatives you might explore and how you can measure the success of these concepts to ensure that they’re going to have an impact on that overarching goal.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607980404342_17070"><div><p>Let’s break down the questions you’ll be asking in each of these boxes:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Top right:</strong> What’s the company goal you’re trying to work toward?</p><p>I try to choose the goal that I know we’ll be able to impact the most. For instance, I’ll rarely choose the Sales goal of increasing annual recurring revenue (ARR), as Developer Relations doesn’t often directly impact the number of closed opportunities (we do have a significant impact on long-term growth, but that’s a topic for another blogpost). If ARR is indeed your company’s one and only goal for the foreseeable future, you could pivot the goal slightly to awareness, as the work output of a DevRel team typically increases the general developer awareness of your product.</p><p><strong>Top left:</strong> What’s one of the ways you want to try to impact that goal this quarter?</p><p>These answers are very general (they might almost feel too general sometimes!) but are buckets of items that you could experiment with throughout this particular time period. For instance, I’d list “Create content” rather than “Write blogposts,” since blogposts are a subset of content, which also includes videos, tutorials, live streams, and more.</p><p><strong>Bottom left: </strong>What are the specific tactics or “levers” you’re going to pull in order to test the experiment?</p><p>This is where we start to explore the more tangible items. Perhaps we’ll start to look at whether external advocates (non-employees) are writing content or speaking at conferences on our behalf, which may help us to decide whether a Champion Program might be a useful initiative to explore in the future.</p><p><strong>Bottom right: </strong>How will you know whether or not the experiment was a success?</p><p>These metrics could be the …</p></div></div></div>

First off, a writer I am not; I neither guarantee grammatical perfection nor am I verbose. Secondly, this will be a fairly technical post. I will try to keep good pacing and not go too deep down the rabbit hole. So without further ado...</p><h2>The overview</h2><p>For those of you who are not familiar with Prelude's&nbsp;<a href="http://prelude.org/">Operator</a>, this discussion will probably not make a lot of sense. So I'd recommend you at the very least download it, log in, and poke around the docs (the community edition is free and available on all major operating systems). Either way, here's a quick overview:</p><p>Operator is desktop application designed to be a one-stop shop for writing TTPs, controlling remote agents, going through up-to-date training on adversarial TTPs,  building and launching custom adversaries powered by an automated planner. If that last bit sounds like Caldera and you know what that is, you're already familiar with David (@privateducky) and me (@khyberspache) :)</p><p>With a few days left in our sprint, I decided to go "all-in" on two areas that had been  bothering me. Specifically, I wanted to improve our agent offerings and demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Operator platform beyond the existing shell command based TTPs. Our basic agent, Pneuma (<a href="http://github.com/preludeorg/pneuma">http://github.com/preludeorg/pneuma</a>) is a vanilla example of how you can design an agent, but it doesn't have much flexibility or extensibility.</p><p><strong>Enter PneumaEX.</strong></p><h2>The problem(s)</h2><p>There were few key problems I was trying to address within the Operator ecosystem:</p><ol><li><p>Shell-based executors (sh, bash, PowerShell, osascript, cmd, etc) don't offer enough complexity for more advanced red, blue, and purple teams. We, as cybersecurity professionals, should be continually evolving our tradecraft over time, so new ways to streamline the testing more variations of TTPs leads to improved detection and response.</p></li><li><p>Advanced agents are difficult to write. There is a lot of boilerplate code that is needed to make even a basic-featured agent capable of communicating over a basic protocol like HTTP. And once you start talking about packaging more advanced capability, you run the risk of  your agent being signatured and having to start from scratch. Obviously, there are ways around that, but in general, less is more in this case.</p></li><li><p>Operator users need a way to quickly implement TTPs as&nbsp;<em>code</em>&nbsp;in order to expand the scope of testing in their particular environment. From the red team perspective, Living off the Land is great, but sometimes it's just easier to bring along a tool. From the blue team perspective, maybe there is an API I should be monitoring that I'm not, and hunting for variations of a technique can help tune detections.</p></li><li><p>Operator's "brain" (automated planner) doesn't have a way to incorporate time or more specifically,&nbsp;<em>expected knowledge,</em>&nbsp;into its planning. It's trivial for a human to run a key logger in the background while working on other tasks, collect the data, exfiltrate and analyze it. However, breaking that down, it's a lot of coordination and timing. In order to replicate that, we need to have the planner make decisions based upon data it&nbsp;<em>expectsto be available</em>&nbsp;at a certain&nbsp;<em>time</em>&nbsp;while still proceeding with its other asynchronous tasking.</p></li></ol><h2>The idea</h2><p>I had prototyped a few different concepts a couple weeks back with the general idea that I want to dynamically load in new "things" at runtime and have those "things" do "stuff." Oh, and have that dynamic piece be cross-platform. While that sounds ridiculously open-ended, that's kinda the whole point of Operator: give you the means to do "things" in a simple way. A modular architecture would keep complexity down while expanding capability, so it's ideal for this use case.</p><p>First thing I went towards was using C to construct SOs, DLLs, and DyLibs that could be loaded into a simple framework agent. Next, I decided what I wanted to do was craft standalone Position Independent Executable (PIE) blobs similar to this:</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;innerHTML&quot;:&quot;<div id=\&quot;gist107082153\&quot; class=\&quot;gist\&quot;>\n    <div class=\&quot;gist-file\&quot;>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-data\&quot;>\n        <div class=\&quot;js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\&quot;>\n  <div id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c\&quot; class=\&quot;file my-2\&quot;>\n    \n\n  <div itemprop=\&quot;text\&quot; class=\&quot;Box-body p-0 blob-wrapper data type-c  \&quot;>\n      \n<table class=\&quot;highlight tab-size js-file-line-container\&quot; data-tab-size=\&quot;8\&quot; data-paste-markdown-skip>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-L1\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;1\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-LC1\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;><span class=\&quot;pl-c\&quot;><span class=\&quot;pl-c\&quot;>//</span> example pie_blob.c </span></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-L2\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;2\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-LC2\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;><span class=\&quot;pl-k\&quot;>int</span> <span class=\&quot;pl-en\&quot;>f1</span>(<span class=\&quot;pl-k\&quot;>int</span> v, <span class=\&quot;pl-k\&quot;>void</span> (* exit)(<span class=\&quot;pl-k\&quot;>int</span>)){     </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-L3\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;3\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-LC3\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>    (*<span class=\&quot;pl-c1\&quot;>exit</span>)(<span class=\&quot;pl-c1\&quot;>0</span>);     </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-L4\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;4\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-LC4\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>    <span class=\&quot;pl-k\&quot;>return</span> v; </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-L5\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-num js-line-number\&quot; data-line-number=\&quot;5\&quot;></td>\n        <td id=\&quot;file-pie_blob-c-LC5\&quot; class=\&quot;blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\&quot;>} </td>\n      </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-meta\&quot;>\n        <a href=\&quot;https://gist.github.com/khyberspache/6d48cad972d625008ebbe96946f3a272/raw/7d4c18c3726ced016dde933e69a4b25b88c5ed83/pie_blob.c\&quot; style=\&quot;float:right\&quot;>view raw</a>\n        <a href=\&quot;https://gist.github.com/khyberspache/6d48cad972d625008ebbe96946f3a272#file-pie_blob-c\&quot;>pie_blob.c</a>\n        hosted with &amp;#10084; by <a href=\&quot;https://github.com\&quot;>GitHub</a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n&quot;,&quot;stylesheet&quot;:&quot;https://github.githubassets.com/assets/gist-embed-fade154c2b3e75984195a048041ab52d.css&quot;}"><div id="gist107082153">

A version of this is still on my TODO list - I think it's an incredibly powerful way to "patch" a binary.</p><p>Next, I poked at GOLang's built-in Plugin module. That was pretty much dead on arrival because: A) it doesn't support Windows, B) it is notoriously buggy according to anecdotes from other engineers using them, and C) Plugin support for Windows isn't even in the backlog (as of this writing).</p><p>After some more poking around, I came across Hashicorp's go-plugin (<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin">https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin</a>). Turns out they built a plugin system for Go because Go's native plugin support isn't up to snuff - and they use it in Packer, Terraform, Nomad, and Vault. Aka it's a perfect solution for a quick implementation of a cross-platform module system. Not to mention, it's RPC/gRPC based, meaning I could write plugins in other languages!</p><h2>The approach</h2><p>The general idea is that we want to be able to have a simple TTP, when applied to an adversary, cause the agent to download a module, install it, then call a specific function inside the module with specific arguments.</p><h3>TTP Definitions:</h3><p>Looking at the TTP below we can see a few things:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4f42cfb-4abb-40d6-a68f-bcb93a298b6d_3024x1824.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4f42cfb-4abb-40d6-a68f-bcb93a298b6d_3024x1824.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a4f42cfb-4abb-40d6-a68f-bcb93a298b6d_3024x1824.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:878,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Prelude Operator TTP Editor: Keyword executor for clipboard capture</p><ol><li><p>We are using what is called a "keyword" executor 3 platforms (Windows and Darwin are visible, Linux is also there).

The best place to start is with the module/plugin definition. Every module requires a very simple structure along with a base configuration. A basic module definition looks like this:</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;innerHTML&quot;:&quot;<div id=\&quot;gist107082219\&quot; class=\&quot;gist\&quot;>\n    <div class=\&quot;gist-file\&quot;>\n      <div class=\&quot;gist-data\&quot;>\n        <div class=\&quot;js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\&quot;>\n  <div id=\&quot;file-capabilities-go\&quot;

</div><p>As you can see, the keyword maps to the ModuleName and Functions. So "module.collect.captureClipboard" is actually going to end up calling the "captureClipboard" function and the results will be returned back to the C2 server! Woot! But what about that ExecFunctions? Well that comes into play with problem 4 above: time-based operations and creating "expected knowledge." ExecFunctions allow you to run the module as a standalone executable. For example, you can have long-running background tasks (like a key logger) while simultaneously informing the automated planner that the logger process will write a file and be done in X minutes.</p><p>Passing in arguments using the fact system is straightforward as well. You can see the "args" slice is passed through to each function.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img alt="Christmas gift." src="https://vstinner.github.io/images/christmas-gift.jpg"></p><p>This article is about the work done in Python in 2019 and 2020 to better
isolate subinterpreters. Static types are converted to heap types, extension
modules are converted to use the new multiphase initialization API (PEP 489),
caches, states, singletons and free lists are made per-interpreter, many bugs
have been fixed, etc.</p>
<p>Running multiple interpreters in parallel with one "GIL" per interpreter cannot
be done yet, but a lot of complex technical challenges have been solved.</p>
<div id="why-isolating-subinterpreters">
<h2>Why isolating subinterpreters?</h2>
<p>The final goal is to be able run multiple interpreters in parallel in the same
process, like one interpreter per CPU, each interpreter would run in its own
thread. The principle is the same than the multiprocessing module and has the
same limitations: no Python object can be shared directly between two
interpreters. Later, we can imagine helpers to share Python mutable objects
using proxies which would prevent race conditions.</p>
<p>The work on subinterpreter requires to modify many functions and extension
modules. It will benefit to Python in different ways.</p>
<p>Converting static types to heap types and convert extension modules to the
multiphase initialization API (PEP 489) makes extension modules implemented in
C to behave closer to modules implemented in Python, which is good for the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0399/">PEP
399 -- Pure Python/C Accelerator Module Compatibility Requirements</a>. So <strong>this work also helps
Python implementations other than CPython, like PyPy</strong>.</p>
<p>These changes also destroy more Python objects and release more memory at
Python exit which matters <strong>when Python is embedded in an application</strong>. Python
should be "state less", especially release all memory at exit. This work slowly
fix the <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue1635741">bpo-163574: Py_Finalize() doesn't clear all Python objects at exit</a>. Python leaks less and less Python
objects at exit.</p>
</div>
<div id="proof-of-concept-in-may-2020">
<h2>Proof-of-concept in May 2020</h2>
<p>In May 2020, I wrote a proof-of-concept to prove the feasability of the project
and to prove that it is faster than sequential execution: <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/S5GZZCEREZLA2PEMTVFBCDM52H4JSENR/#RIK75U3ROEHWZL4VENQSQECB4F4GDELV">PoC: Subinterpreters
4x faster than sequential execution or threads on CPU-bound workaround</a>.
Benchmark on 4 CPUs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sequential: 1.99 sec +- 0.01 sec</li>
<li>Threads: 3.15 sec +- 0.97 sec (1.5x <strong>slower</strong>)</li>
<li>Multiprocessing: 560 ms +- 12 ms (3.6x <strong>faster</strong>)</li>
<li>Subinterpreters: 583 ms +- 7 ms (3.4x <strong>faster</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of subintepreters is basically the same speed than
multiprocessing on this benchmark which is promising.</p>
</div>
<div id="experimental-isolated-subintepreters">
<h2>Experimental isolated subintepreters</h2>
<p>To write this PoC, I added a <tt><span>--with-experimental-isolated-subinterpreters</span></tt>
option to <tt>./configure</tt> in <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue40514">bpo-40514</a>
which defines the <tt>EXPERIMENTAL_ISOLATED_SUBINTERPRETERS</tt> macro. Effects of
this special build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the GIL per-interpreter.</li>
<li><tt>_xxsubinterpreters.run_string()</tt> releases the GIL when running the
subinterpreter.</li>
<li>Add a thread local storage for the Python thread state ("tstate").</li>
<li>Disable the garbage collector in subinterpreters.</li>
<li>Disable the type attribute lookup cache.</li>
<li>Disable free lists: frame, list, tuple, type attribute lookup cache.</li>
<li>Disable singletons: latin1 characters.</li>
<li>Disable interned strings.</li>
<li>Disable the fast pymalloc memory allocator (force libc malloc memory
allocator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Features are disabled because their implementation is currently not compatible
with multiple interpreters running in parallel.</p>
<p>This special build is designed to be temporary. It should ease the development
of isolated subinterpreters. It will be removed once subinterpreters will be
fully isolated (once each interpreter will have its own GIL).</p>
</div>
<div id="convert-static-types-to-heap-types">
<h2>Convert static types to heap types</h2>
<p>Types declared in Python (<tt>class MyType: ...</tt>) are always "heap types":
types dynamically allocated on the heap memory. Historically, all types
declared in C were declared as "static types": defined statically at build
time.</p>
<p>In C, static types are referenced directly using the using <tt>&amp;</tt> operator to
get their address, they are not copied. For example, the Python <tt>str</tt> type is
referenced as <tt>&amp;PyUnicode_Type</tt> in C.</p>
<p>Types are also regular objects (<tt>PyTypeObject</tt> inherits from <tt>PyObject</tt>)
and have a reference count, whereas the <tt>PyObject.ob_refcnt</tt> member is not
atomic and so must not be modified in parallel. Problem: all interpreters share
the same static types.  Static types have other problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type <tt>__mro__</tt> tuple (<tt>PyTypeObject.tp_mro</tt> member) has the same
problem of non-atomic reference count.</li>
<li>When a subtype is created, it is stored in the <tt>PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses</tt>
dictionary member (accessible in Python with the <tt>__subclasses__()</tt>
method), whereas Python dictionaries are not thread-safe.</li>
<li>Static types behave differently than regular Python types. For example,
usually it is not possible to add an arbitrary attribute or override
an attribute. It goes against the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0399/">PEP 399 -- Pure Python/C Accelerator
Module Compatibility Requirements</a> principles.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, <strong>43% (89/206)</strong> of types are declared as heap types on a total of
206 types. For comparison, in Python 3.8, only 9% (15/172) of types were
declared as heap types: <strong>74 types</strong> have been converted in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>TODO: convert the remaining 117 static types: see <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue40077">bpo-40077</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="multiphase-initialization-api">
<h2>Multiphase initialization API</h2>
<p>Historically, extension modules are declared with the <tt>PyModule_Create()</tt>
function. Usually, such extension can be instanciated exactly once. It is
stored in an internal <tt>PyInterpreterState.modules_by_index</tt> list; an unique
index is assigned to the module and stored in <tt>PyModuleDef.m_base.m_index</tt>.
Usually, such extension use static global variables.</p>
<p>Such "static" extension has multiple issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension cannot be unloaded: its memory is not released at Python exit.
It is an issue when Python is embedded in an application.</li>
<li>The extension behaves differently than modules defined in Python. When an
extension is reimported, its namespace (<tt>module.__dict__</tt>) is duplicated,
but mutable objects and static global variables are still shared. It goes
against the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0399/">PEP 399 -- Pure Python/C Accelerator Module Compatibility
Requirements</a> principles.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2013, <strong>Petr Viktorin</strong>, <strong>Stefan Behnel</strong> and <strong>Nick Coghlan</strong> wrote the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/">PEP 489 -- Multi-phase extension module initialization</a> which has been approved and
implemented in Python 3.5. For example, the <tt>_abc</tt> module initialization
function is now just a call to the new <tt>PyModuleDef_Init()</tt> function:</p>
<pre>PyMODINIT_FUNC
PyInit__abc(void)
{
    return PyModuleDef_Init(&amp;_abcmodule);
}
</pre>
<p>An extension module can have a module state, if <tt>PyModuleDef.m_size</tt> is
greater than zero. Example:</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
    PyTypeObject *_abc_data_type;
    unsigned long long abc_invalidation_counter;
} _abcmodule_state;

static struct PyModuleDef _abcmodule = {
    ...
    .m_size = sizeof(_abcmodule_state),  // &lt;=== HERE ===
};
</pre>
<p>The <tt>PyModule_GetState()</tt> can be used to retrieve the module state. Example:</p>
<pre>static inline _abcmodule_state*
get_abc_state(PyObject *module)
{
    void *state = PyModule_GetState(module);
    assert(state != NULL);
    return (_abcmodule_state *)state;
}

static PyObject *
_abc__abc_init(PyObject *module, PyObject *self)
{
    _abcmodule_state *state = get_abc_state(module);
    ...
    data = abc_data_new(state-&gt;_abc_data_type, NULL, NULL);
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Right now, <strong>77% (102/132)</strong> of extension modules use the new multiphase
initialization API (PEP 489) on a total of 132 extension modules.  For
comparison, in Python 3.8, only 23% (27/118) of extensions used the new
multiphase initialization API: <strong>75 extensions</strong> have been converted in the
meanwhile.</p>
<p>TODO: convert the remaining 30 extension modules (<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue1635741">bpo-163574</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="module-states">
<h2>Module states</h2>
<p>Some modules have a state which should be stored in the interpreter to share
its state between multiple instances of the module, and also to give access to
the state in functions of the public C API (ex: <tt>PyAST_Check()</tt>).</p>
<p>States made per-interpreter:</p>

<p>I see you, serial DM’ers. Yes you there, defaulting to 1-on-1 chats instead of team chat rooms. You know who you are.</p>



<p>You mean well, I get it. Why would you ask the whole team something when you can just DM the person you know has the answer? You’re protecting the rest of the team from stuff that they don’t care about, right? You’re helping them avoid <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">distraction and chat overwhelm</a>, yeah?</p>



<p>Wrong. You’re a thief. <em><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">The Serendipity Bandit</a></em>, that’s you.</p>



<ul><li>You’re robbing the rest of the team of opportunities to learn from the answers to the questions you ask.</li><li>You’re robbing yourself of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/27/coaching-without-doing/">the chance to learn</a> from advice and insight the rest of the team may have.</li><li>You’re robbing everyone of unexpected connections and the chance to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">be noisy, as the best teams are</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s my rule of thumb: only use DMs for things that are actually private. <strong>Private chats are for private things</strong>. Everything else should go in a team room. </p>



<p>I don’t care what it is. Questions about a broken build, thoughts about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">the roadmap</a>, pondering about a movie you saw, a link to a dope YouTube video, whatever. Put it in a team room unless it’s actually private.</p>



<p>If you’re worried you’ll annoy people, then who are you to decide on their behalf that they’ll be annoyed? If you’re worried you’ll <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">look stupid</a> or nerdy for asking dumb questions or broadcasting dorky thoughts to everyone, have you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">considered not caring</a>? Maybe you’ll see that your teammates are just as dumb and nerdy as you are.</p>



<p>Show some vulnerability and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/14/are-we-actually-a-team/">see what happens</a>. And for goodness sake, when you see someone else doing that, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/05/respond-to-vulnerability-with-vulnerability/">be the first follower</a>.</p>

		<p>On the whole, BASIC is an unfairly maligned programming language. By the 90s it had come a long way from the GOTO-peppered, line-numbered morass which earned Dijkstra's ire. Modern BASICs have great support for structured programming -- not just procedures and while loops, but classes and modules, too.&nbsp;However, there is one famous BASIC feature which is every bit as evil as it sounds.</p>
<p>Errors in early BASICs tended to be fatal. This meant that writing robust programs meant doing a lot of careful checking before any potentially-dangerous operation. (Writing non-robust programs meant getting used to restarting them a lot). In many ways, the error handling environment of BASIC was more difficult to work with than other languages of the time, such as C, with the result that many people wished instead that they could just make errors go away so they didn’t have to think about them. Enter ON ERROR RESUME NEXT.</p>
<p>When a BASIC interpreter encounters ON ERROR RESUME NEXT, it stops reporting errors to the program. That’s it. Oh sure, they still <em>happen</em>, but you don’t need to worry about them now. When an error occurs BASIC will just continue on the next line of the program. Open a file which doesn’t exist? No worries. Divide by zero? Sure. Every path is the happy path now. (1)</p>
<p>So anyway, I've been deep in Python internals recently, and one night while drinking heavily (2) the thought occurred to me: could we implement ON ERROR RESUME NEXT in Python? Could we just have the interpreter swallow exceptions and keep going? Turns out we pretty much can!</p>

<p>Yes, I did actually write this. No, I don’t recommend anyone use it. But the implementation and revealed information about how Python works is pretty interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Python uses the “termination” model of error handling: an exception handler can find out what happened and continue execution at an outer level, but it cannot repair the cause of the error and retry the failing operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#exceptions">Python documentation</a>, sweet summer child</p>
<p>When something goes wrong in Python, it raises an exception. If the exception isn’t handled by the function which generated it, it propagates back up the call stack until it reaches an exception handler. If the exception handler can’t handle that type of exception, it continues its journey upwards. If there are no suitable exception handlers, the exception propagates all the way up to the top level, and the Python interpreter itself handles it by printing a traceback and exiting. Very BASIC-like, that part.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Python is that its tracebacks are very rich. As well as the line number of the failing instruction, they also contain one frame object per traceback level. Frame objects are the magic on which the present abomination turns, because frame objects contain a pointer to the compiled code that was running, the exact Python opcode that failed, the <tt>locals</tt>&nbsp;and <tt>globals</tt>&nbsp;which were active in that frame… in fact, almost everything one might need to re-start execution.</p>
<p>If the above has given you a terrible idea, then we should be friends. What it means is that if <tt>function1</tt>&nbsp;calls <tt>function2()</tt>&nbsp;and <tt>function2</tt>&nbsp;throws an exception, the traceback will contain frame objects for <tt>function1</tt>&nbsp;and <tt>function2</tt>. Both functions' local variables, instruction pointer, and so on are all faithfully preserved in their respective frame objects, so if we were to somehow re-enter <tt>function2</tt>, restoring all its state, and jump directly to the the line of code after the one which threw the exception, we could effectively <tt>RESUME NEXT</tt>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, then, we are going to</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the bytecode from the frame object and add a portion at the beginning which</li>
<li>Restores the function context we pulled out of the frame stack and</li>
<li>Jumps directly to either the instruction which performs the function call to the next-lowest function in the traceback &nbsp;(if this wasn’t the frame which produced the exception), or the instruction corresponding to the next line of code (if this was the frame that produced the exception). Then we</li>
<li>Take the top-level patched function, the one at the outermost level of the traceback, and run it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The top-level function will call all the way down the call &nbsp;hierarchy pulled out of the traceback, finally reaching the function which raised the exception. That final, leaf function will continue on the line after the one which raised. Simple! ON ERROR RESUME NEXT.</p>

<p>You might be thinking (I was), “Nicholas, this isn’t very BASIC if I have to wrap all our code in an exception handler. That’s exactly the sort of error shenanigans I was hoping to avoid!” Well, fortunately, Python offers <tt>sys.excepthook</tt>&nbsp;as a last-resort way of handling top-level exceptions. If <tt>sys.excepthook</tt> is set, exceptions which reach the top level are passed to it. So we can implement our <tt>RESUME NEXT</tt>&nbsp;from there. More on this later. For now, let’s dive into the horrifying world of Python’s four different stacks.</p>

<p>There are lots of implementations of Python, but unless you’re doing something quite specialised you’ll be using the one available from python.org known as CPython.&nbsp;CPython bytecode is stack-based. In fact, Python’s creators loved stacks so much, they used four of them. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Python call stack. This is an array of frame objects, one per function invocation. When you call a function, Python creates a new frame object and puts it on this stack. When the function returns, Python pops its frame object off the call stack. Simple.</li>
<li>The C stack. CPython is written in C, hence the name, and its interpreter uses the C stack internally in the way all C programs do, for storing call frames and local variables.</li>
<li>The block stack. When you write an exception handler, Python puts the location of its <tt>finally</tt> clause (which may be empty if you didn’t write one) on the block stack. It’s also used for <tt>with</tt>, and a few other things. Each frame has its own block stack, and when an exception is raised this is what’s consulted to find a handler.</li>
<li>The value stack. In a stack-based language like CPython, all data is passed on the stack. A line like <tt>value = 42</tt>&nbsp;is translated to bytecode which first pushes 42 onto the stack, and then pops the top of the stack and stores the result in <tt>value</tt>. Each frame has its own value stack, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wrote above that tracebacks contain “almost everything” required to re-run the code causing an exception. Guess what tracebacks don’t contain? That’s right, the stacks!</p>
<p>(Except the Python call stack, of course. We get that one.)</p>

<p>The real killer is the value stack. Because Python uses the value stack for everything, it’s really important that we restore it. As an example, consider this code snippet:</p>
<pre>def f(value):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; result = explodey(value)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [ more processing here ]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return result</pre>
<p>This disassembles to the following bytecode:</p>
<pre>    0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (explodey)<br>    2 LOAD_FAST 0 (value)<br>    4 CALL_FUNCTION 1<br>    6 STORE_FAST 1 (result)<br>    8 LOAD_FAST 1 (result)<br>    10 RETURN_VALUE</pre>
<p>Let’s say that <tt>explodey</tt>&nbsp;throws an exception, resulting in <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>&nbsp;failing. We want to resume at the next instruction (3) here, which is <tt>STORE_FAST</tt>. So we will just jump right back into the function at <tt>STORE_FAST</tt>, index 6, and… immediately hit a stack underflow error because <tt>STORE_FAST</tt>&nbsp;is expecting to pop something (the thing it’s storing fast!) off the value stack.</p>
<p>Okay, no problem. The value stack is <em>there</em>, in the frame object. It’s just not obviously accessible to us. Once we have the value stack and the value stack pointer, which tells us how many value stack objects are active, we can pull that number of objects out of the frame and push them back onto the stack when we call the function again to retry. Sounds… simple?</p>
<h2>Finding the number of items on the value stack</h2>
<p>You can’t. Python doesn’t expose this information in any way, and in fact it couldn’t even if it wanted to because the stack pointer is a local variable stored on the interpreter’s (C) stack, and by the time we’ve got the traceback those (C) stack frames have disappeared.</p>
<p>Alright, so how do we get this information if it’s literally not there? Well, it is there. In a way.</p>
<p>Look again at the disassembly above. We see <tt>LOAD_GLOBAL</tt>, <tt>LOAD_FAST</tt>, and so on. Looking at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html">the documentation</a> for these opcode we see that both of these push a value onto the stack. <tt>CALL_FUNCTION (1)</tt>&nbsp;consumes the number of arguments supplied (1), plus the callable itself, but it then pushes the function’s return value. <tt>STORE_FAST</tt>&nbsp;pops a value. And so on.</p>
<p>For this function, execution stopped at <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>. That means we executed <tt>LOAD_GLOBAL</tt>&nbsp;(add 1 to the stack pointer), <tt>LOAD_FAST</tt>&nbsp;(add 1 again), and <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>&nbsp;(subtract 1 for the argument, subtract another 1 for the callable, then add 1 for the return code). So just by looking at the code, we see that by the time <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>&nbsp;has finished, we have one value on the stack.</p>
<p>Can we formalise this? Of course we can, in the form of an abstract interpreter. We “execute” the Python bytecode, but the only thing we keep track of is the current stack depth. When we reach the instruction of interest (i.e. the one which produced the exception, i.e. <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>&nbsp;in this example), we stop.</p>
<p>Abstract interpretation sounds hard, but it’s actually easier than you might expect. For example, the stack level before a loop is the same as the stack level after a loop, no matter how many times the loop executes. So we don’t need to worry about how many times a loop will execute. No matter what a function does, <tt>CALL_FUNCTION</tt>&nbsp;will always push exactly one value. So we don’t need to trace our way through function calls. We do need to worry about opcodes like <tt>JUMP_ABSOLUTE</tt>, which change the program counter, but that’s relatively straightforward. We also need to worry about conditional jumps — but we can handle those by trying both options (jump taken and jump not taken), one after the other. Our abstract interpreter just wombles through the code, not worrying too much about what it does but maintaining a stack pointer, until its instruction pointer matches the …</p></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>No one wants to launch a product that nobody needs.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>Before developing a full-fledged product, it’s necessary to see proof of its viability and likelihood of attracting investments and users. That is why these three tools exist — the Proof of Concept (POC), the prototype, and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</p>
<p>What are they for, who are they for, and how to they improve the product development process?&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Research: Proof of Concept (POC)</h2>
<p>Question: <em>Can it be done?</em><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/06oIxuXgIJ3eCmy3qO4YpMzax4MPiPfadZJLzeEXA68qGwgiPc1lKtg7CK1K8oX6D8BN6g4_SpMSwaRMfIqYOS5YoI1YHhxrZPeP-1CnSrGXOdAYNAhmtou1c17BroRX5ato5W3_" width="741" alt="man looking at whiteboard product mapping plan"></span></p>
<p>When companies cannot yet be sure if they can trust your idea or your capabilities as a development team, what you need to do is convince them that they can. That’s what a Proof of Concept does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially for concepts or methods that are new to the market, a POC sells your idea by verifying that your hypothesis has the potential for real-world application.</p>
<p>Unlike a prototype and an MVP, a Proof of Concept isn’t customer-focused and is only shared within the product team. Being in the research phase of the product development process, its focus is not yet on representing deliverables or gathering feedback, but on laying the foundation by determining technical and functional feasibility.</p>
<p>Usually, these feasibility tests are done on specific functions within the product. A great example would be Walmart testing blockchain technology on cross-border product tracking before officially implementing it into their logistics.</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>1. To test a product’s technical feasibility.<br>2. To validate a particular feature or functionality.<br>3. To prove that a product can perform as envisioned.</p>
<h3>Audience:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Product team.</p>
<h3>Benefits:</h3>
<p>1. Saves time and costs.<br>2. Gives potential investors confidence.<br>3. Saves resources and reduces risk.</p>
<h2>Design: Prototype</h2>
<p>Question: <em>How can it be done?</em><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K6_mn0XeVJUL4iz983E4ciOwvnCgxjASjMNsyhce85vcSwC4qwD6gQzDW77q5vEii0eTJ69vLTAgjn2sQnZithoXeVNFpSOxznbb5QLUgHAqxf-6lJzLWKuj2CsZsa0gfCfJ0Drs" width="744" alt="marvelapp prototype design uiux user flows"></span><br>Image: <a href="https://userflows.marvelapp.com/"><span>Marvel</span></a></p>
<p>After a POC proves that an idea is viable, prototypes come next in line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mockup created to visualize elements and user interaction flows, prototypes focus on UI/UX design and getting feedback on usability and user experience. Designers in a product team work with wireframes to produce an imitation that is interactive and reflective of the desired look and feel of the product.</p>
<p>Being part of the design phase of the product pipeline, prototypes often underlie MVPs in the development phase. It is extremely useful for early investor demonstrations and user testing.</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>1. To visualize functionality and user flows.<br>2. To highlight design, usability, and user experience.<br>3. To get early feedback from end users.</p>
<h3>Audience:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Product team and select users.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Identifies technical challenges early.<br>2. Attracts investors and encourages funding.<br>3. Saves resources and reduces risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Develop: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong></h2>
<p>A Minimum Viable Product, also known as an Earliest Testable Product or pilot, is generally defined as “a standalone application that is launch-ready”.</p>
<p>Henrik Kniberg explains on <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp"><span>Crisp’s blog</span></a> that building an MVP is less about building an incomplete or to-be-completed version of your product, but delivering the smallest or simplest possible way to fulfill your users’ underlying needs. It has to be testable and usable because unlike a prototype, MVPs are released to the public for real users to put their hands on and respond to.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GuQYa7AWjzP7cvKvs9LkqWzG2yQT0o6xKe8x-j_Z62ZeLCHsRriiNPwJkYfmCrBApQ03YfvMF4kUp7pobXh977fxJKoeUcOVXAiL_oGFJIpO96yFnHYT7UlxoLe1PxJ2TJxnouD0" width="731" alt="henrik kniber illustration mvp car product pipeline"></span></p>
<p>At this point of a project, although close to a full-fledged launch, it’s more about selling people a function rather than the actual product. It’s giving them a tool that helps them achieve a goal the same, despite it being different from the product you’re planning to eventually arrive at.</p>
<p>User feedback plays an important role in this stage of development. With the help of constructive feedback, a team figures out how to iterate on their MVP and transform it from a Minimum Testable Product to a Minimum Usable Product, and finally to a Minimum Lovable Product that is marketable and close to their final vision.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Purpose:</strong></h3>
<p>1. To assess and reduce risks of failure.<br>2. To get more feedback from end users.</p>
<h3><strong>Audience:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Product team and general public.</p>
<h3><strong>Benefits:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Saves development time and costs.<br>2. Reduces time-to-market.<br>3. Draws focus onto essentials.</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There are a ton of free comment widgets available- Facebook comments, Disqus, Livefyre and many more. They're outnumbered by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=using+github+issues+for+blog+comments">blog posts</a> on replacing these bloated, privacy destroyers with a custom systems that use GitHub issues as a backing data store.</p>
<p>Enter <strong><a href="https://utteranc.es/">https://utteranc.es</a></strong>, my take on hosting blog comments on GitHub issues. Lightweight, easy to configure and secure. No need to worry about GitHub API rate limits, managing server-side code, manually linking blog posts to issues or forcing users to leave your site to post a comment.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun building this app, it served as the POC for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs">GitHub issue integration in Microsoft Docs</a>. Much of the GitHub API and OAuth related code is shared. There are some features that haven't made it into docs <em>yet</em> like markdown preview. On the other hand, we've implemented reactions in docs, which hasn't been backported to utterances yet. As of this writing, users have opened <em><a href="https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E%3D2017-12-15+is%3Apublic+in%3Abody+%22Version+Independent+ID%22+-repo%3AMicrosoftDocs%2FSamplesPages+-repo%3Ajdanyow%2Ftest2">more than 2,250 issues</a></em> via the GitHub based feedback system in Microsoft Docs. Pretty crazy. Kudos to the content teams that are keeping up with all the issues!</p>

<p>A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.</p>

(B) Proportion of S gene drop-outs (5 – 11 December) versus mean reproduction number (27 November – 4 December) by local authority in England. The one-week lag accounts for delays from infection to test. (C) Percentage change (95% CI) in Google Mobility indices relative to baseline over time and (D) setting-specific mean contacts (95% CI) from the CoMix study (9) over time and by age for local authorities that went into Tier 4 compared to the rest of England.

Some local authorities that were within the South East, East of England, and London NHS England regions did not go into Tier 4 and were therefore included in the rest of England for panels C and D. (E) Estimates of R0 (50% and 95% CI) from CoMix social contact survey compared to Rt estimates from REACT-1 SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey for England.

                <p>By Brian Storti. </p><p><em>Originally published on Brian Storti's <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/replication/">blog</a>. </em></p><p>Replicating a database can make our applications faster and increase our tolerance to failures, but there are a lot of different options available and each one comes with a price tag. It’s hard to make the right choice if we do not understand how the tools we are using work, and what are the guarantees they provide (or, more importantly, do <em>not</em> provide), and that’s what I want to explore here.</p><h4 id="before-we-start-some-background">Before we start, some background</h4><p>My workplace has offices in North America, Europe and Asia and is rapidly expanding. People working in these 3 continents rely heavily on the tools that we build to do their job, so any performance issue has a big impact in their work. As the number of people using our systems increased our database started to feel the pressure. Initially we could just keep increasing our database server capacity, getting a more powerful machine, adding more RAM, and keep scaling vertically, but there is one problem that we cannot solve, unfortunately: The limit of the speed of light.</p><blockquote><em><em>Light travels with a speed of 299,792 km/s in a vacuum. Even if we assume that our requests are traveling at this speed, and that they travel in a straight line, it would still take 133ms for a round the world trip. In reality, our requests will be slower than the speed of light and there will be a lot of zig zag from one hop to another until they reach their destination.</em></em></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/ping-table.png" alt=""></figure><p>No matter how quickly we can <em>execute</em> a query, if the database is in North America, the data still needs to travel all the way to Asia before people in that office can use it. It was clear that we had to make that data available somewhere closer to them, and so the quest began.</p><p>Researching all the available options and everything that is involved in a database replication setup can be overwhelming, there are literally decades of literature about the subject, and after you start digging it’s hard to see the end.</p><p>I am by no means a replication expert, but during this process I learned a thing or two, and that’s what I want to share here. This is not supposed to be an extensive resource to learn everything there is to know about replication, but hopefully it’s a good starting point that you can use in your own journey. In the end of this article I will link to some great resources that can be helpful if you decide to learn more.</p><p>Sounds good? Cool, grab a cup of coffee and let’s have fun.</p><h3 id="first-things-first-the-what-and-the-why">First things first, the what and the why</h3><p>Just to make sure we are on the same page, let’s define what replication is and describe the three main reasons why we might want it.</p><p>When we say we want to replicate something, it means we want to keep a copy of the same data in multiple places. In the case of databases, that can mean a copy of the entire database, which is the most common scenario, or just some parts of it (e.g. a set of tables). These multiple locations where we will keep the data are usually connected by a network, and that’s the origin of most of our headaches, as you will see in a bit.</p><p>The reason for wanting that will be one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>You want to keep the data closer to your users so you can save the travel time. Remember, no matter how fast your database is, the data still needs to travel from the computer that started the request to the server where the database is, and then back again. You can optimize the heck out of your database, but you cannot optimize the laws of physics.</li><li>You want to scale the number of machines serving requests. At some point a single server will not be able to handle the number of clients it needs to serve. In that case, having several databases with the same data helps you serve more clients. That’s what we call scaling <em>horizontally</em> (as opposed to <em>vertically</em>, which means having a more powerful machine).</li><li>You want to be safe in case of failures (that will happen). Imagine you have your data in single database server and that server catches fire, then what happens? I am sure you have some sort of backup (right?!), but your backup will a) take some time to be restored and b) probably be <em>at least</em> a couple of hours old. Not cool. Having a replica means you can just start sending your requests to this server while you are solving the fire situation, and maybe no one will even notice that something bad happened.</li></ul><h4 id="the-obligatory-cap-introduction">The obligatory CAP introduction</h4><p>The CAP theorem was introduced by Eric Brewer in the year 2000, so it’s not a new idea. The acronym stands for <code>C</code>onsistency, <code>A</code>vailability and <code>P</code>artition Tolerance, and it basically says that, given these 3 properties in a distributed system, you need to choose 2 of them (i.e. you cannot have all 3). In practice, it means you need to choose between consistency and availability when an inevitable partition happens. If this sounds confusing, let me briefly define what these 3 terms mean, and why I am even talking about this here.</p><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/cap.png" alt=""></figure><p><strong><strong>Consistency</strong></strong>: In the CAP definition, consistency means that all the nodes in a cluster (e.g. all your database servers, leaders and replicas) see the same data at any given point in time. In practice, it means that if you query any of your database servers at the exact same time, you will get the same result back.</p><blockquote><em><em>Notice that this is completely unrelated to the ‘Consistency’ from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)#As_an_ACID_guarantee">ACID</a> properties.</em></em></blockquote><p><strong><strong>Availability</strong></strong>: It means that reads and writes will always succeed, even if we cannot guarantee that it will have the most recent data. In practice, it means that we will still be able to use one of our databases, even when it cannot talk to the others, and therefore might not have received the latest updates.</p><p><strong><strong>Partition Tolerance</strong></strong>: This means that your system will continue working even if there is a network partition. A network partition means that the nodes in your cluster cannot talk to each other.</p><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/network-partition.png" alt=""></figure><p>And why am I talking about this? Well, because depending on the route you take you will have different trade-offs, sometimes favoring consistency and sometimes availability.</p><p>How valuable the CAP theorem is in the distributed systems discussions is debatable, but I think it is useful to keep in mind that you are almost always trading consistency for availability (and vice-versa) when dealing with network partitions.</p><h4 id="a-word-about-latency">A word about latency</h4><p><em>Latency</em> is the time that a request is waiting to be handled (it’s <em>latent</em>). Our goal is to have the lowest latency possible. Of course, even with a low latency we can still have a high <em>response time</em> (if a query takes a long time to run, for example), but that’s a different problem.</p><p>When we replicate our database we can decrease the latency by shortening the distance this request needs to travel and/or increasing our capacity, so the request doesn’t need to wait before it can be handled due to a busy server.</p><p>I’m just mentioning this here because I think it’s very important to be sure that the reason why we are experiencing high response times is really because the latency is high, otherwise we may be solving the wrong problem.</p><h4 id="asynchronous-replication">Asynchronous replication</h4><p>When we talk about replication, we are basically saying that when I write some data in a given node <code>A</code>, this same data also needs to be written in node <code>B</code> (and maybe <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> and <code>E</code> and…), but we need to decide <em>how</em> this replication will happen, and what are the guarantees that we need. As always, it’s all about trade-offs. Let’s explore our options.</p><p>The first option is to be happy to send a confirmation back to the client as soon as the node that received the message has successfully written the data, and <em>then</em> send this message to the replicas (that may or may not be alive). It works somewhat like this:</p><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/async.png" alt=""></figure><p>This looks great, we don’t notice any performance impact as the replication happens in the background, after we already got a response, and if the replica is dead or slow we won’t even notice it, as the data was already sent back to the client. Life is good.</p><p>There are (at least) two main issues with asynchronous replication. The first is that we are weakening our durability guarantees, and the other is that we are exposed to replication lags. We will talk about replication lag later, let’s focus on the durability issue first.</p><p>Our problem here is that if the node that received this write request fails before it can replicate this change to the replicas, the data is lost, even though we sent a confirmation to the client.</p><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/async_failure.png" alt=""></figure><p>You may be asking yourself</p><blockquote><em><em>“But what are the chances of a failure happening right at THAT moment?!”</em></em></blockquote><p>If that’s the case, I’ll suggest that you instead ask</p><blockquote><em><em>“What are the <em>consequences</em> if a failure happens at that moment?”</em></em></blockquote><p>Yes, it may be totally fine to take the risk, but in the classic example of dealing with financial transactions, maybe it’s better to pay the price to have stronger guarantees. But what is the price?</p><h4 id="synchronous-replication">Synchronous replication</h4><p>As you might expect, synchronous replication basically means that we will <em>first</em> replicate the data, and then send a confirmation to the client.</p><figure><img src="https://www.brianstorti.com/assets/images/replication/sync.png" alt=""></figure><p>So when the client gets the confirmation we can be sure that the data is replicated and safe (well, it’s never 100% safe, all of our data centers can, in theory, explode at the same time, but it’s safe enough).</p><p>The price we need to pay is: Performance and availability.</p><p>The performance penalty is due to the fact that we need to <em>wait</em> for these - potentially - slow replicas to do their thing and send us a confirmation before we can tell the client that everything is going to be fine.

If one of the replicas (remember, we can have many!) is down or we cannot reach it for some reason, we simply cannot write any data.

The IBM PCjr is a personal computer introduced in 1983 and sold through
1985. It had some nice features that other computers did not have at
the time, but it was not compatible enough with the rest of the IBM PC
family to be successful as a pure PC clone, and initially it was too
expensive to compete against "home" machines such as the Apple ][ and
the Commodore 64. As a result, the IBM PCjr did not sell well and it is
considered to be one of the bigger flops in the industry.
      <p>I still like mine though. These web pages are an attempt
to preserve the history and technical information of the IBM PCjr.</p>
      <p>If you have questions or comments, please email me at
mbbrutman at gmail.com. Please, no spam or unreasonable requests.
I am interested in hearing your stories about the PCjr and meeting
other owners of these fascinating machines.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Let’s come back, more directly, to a theme in my writing — what happens when something small becomes a tipping point for change. <strong>When the seemingly innocuous becomes unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve only casually followed the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/why-are-there-so-many-protests-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong protests</a> and reaction from the Chinese mainland and overseas Chinese communities, you might wonder about the importance and meaning of the covered eye. Specifically, the right eye.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters found one of their many symbols (and there are many) when police shot and injured the right eye of a protesting woman in August. The injured eye is a more powerful symbol than even that of the man police shot on October 1 (Chinese National Day) in the chest (that is, <em>the heart</em>).</p>
<p>But since the now famous protester’s eye injury we’ve seen company ad campaign apologies and even an individual arrest all because of missing eyes.</p>
<p>But the eye I was reminded of was none of these. It was a different eye — also a right eye and in China — that over 40 years ago had results reminiscent to those eyes of today.</p>

<p>If you are a student of Chinese Cultural Revolution artwork, you might recognize this painting of an owl by Huang Yongyu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg" alt="Huang Yongyu's owl with one closed eye" width="400" height="607" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Huang served three and a half years in a labor camp for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/huang-yongyu/owl-1973">painting was interpreted</a> as a “portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings.” It’s not clear if he meant it as such.</p>
<p>Huang’s owl was one of many works of art gathered for a “black painting” (meaning counter-revolutionary) <a href="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6w1007nt&amp;chunk.id=d0e11683&amp;toc.id=d0e10324&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=bkd0e11803#X">exhibition and criticism</a> meeting in the 1970s. In some cases, officials had to scrounge around to find more “black painters” to have enough art to criticize. If you read some of the art descriptions, it seems like at least some of the artists were just unlucky rather than counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>And while I haven’t seen anyone publicly connect Huang’s winking owl with the protests of today, I imagine people with longer memories think about it.</p>
<p>Next in chronology we have of course the event from this summer in Hong Kong. A woman attending a protest was shot in her right eye. Covering one’s <a href="https://www.thelily.com/an-eye-for-an-eye-how-one-womans-eye-patch-became-the-symbol-of-the-hong-kong-protests/">right eye</a> soon became a symbol.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1496"><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hong-Kong-eye-e1572126020800.png" alt="Covering the right eye" width="600" height="309"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1496">from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/13/how-bloody-eye-patches-became-latest-symbol-escalating-hong-kong-protests/">Washington Post</a> article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as a good symbol, it is impossible to ignore (you can’t look away from someone’s eyes and still talk). As a good symbol it also brings the eye-patch wearers themselves into some discomfort.</p>
<p>The eye symbol became even better known when a foreign company felt pressure to remove and apologize for an old ad that predated the Hong Kong protests, but which happened to include a covered right eye.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/742601426037240952/">Tiffany ad</a> (since removed) that pre-dates the protests.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - one covered eye" width="474" height="554" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg 474w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>And here’s <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/08/tiffany-removes-advert-hong-kong-controversy/">another Tiffany ad</a>, also removed following complaints to the company for stirring up social disorder.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - covered right eye" width="525" height="273" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-300x156.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-768x399.jpg 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>And to compare, here’s another picture of Sun Feifei (the same model in the second Tiffany ad) covering her right eye in another photo shoot, also months before the protests in Hong Kong. And actually shown on a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/photos/2010-04/20/content_19863707.htm">government-run website, even today</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg" alt="Tiffany model covering her right eye" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg 400w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>So eye covering can look like a matter of intent. The china.org.cn right eye picture can obviously have no connection to the Hong Kong protests. But a foreign company is different, even with ads shot months before the covered eye became a protest symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, the covered eye — again, the right eye — has been used famously before in an ad campaign: “The Man in the Hathaway Shirt.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg" alt="Man in the Hathaway shirt" width="525" height="706" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg 595w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-223x300.jpg 223w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>No political meaning. Just an Ogilvy ad with the eyepatch used as a gimmick.</p>
<p>But there’s more again.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://shanghaiist.com/2019/10/08/houston-rockets-fan-detained-for-posting-photo-of-himself-about-to-burn-chinese-flag/">Houston Rockets fan in China</a> (the same team whose manager posted a “Stand with Hong Kong” tweet) was much too cynical on the ability of his government to track him down.</p>
<p>The first line (after the hashtag) says: “I live and die with my team.” The second line: “Come and catch me.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-1024x546.jpg" alt="Covered right eye, now in jail" width="525" height="280" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-300x160.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>They caught him, just a few hours later. And it appears he covered an eye to make facial identification more difficult. But again, what if he hadn’t covered his eye?</p>
<p>The apology from Tiffany strikes an international audience as the exportation of anti-protester values. The above picture of the NBA fan chained in a “tiger chair” strikes an international audience as not the future they want for themselves. <strong>Has the visual symbol of the eye — uncontrollable once the injury and advertisements happened — helped spread this message further?</strong></p>
<h2>Wearing of Masks</h2>
<p>Should protesters anywhere be allowed to wear masks? While a number of US states already had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/10/22/boston-and-hong-kong-debate-over-masks/JYajFCkul7UMw7PaXyZ5vL/story.html">mask bans in public spaces</a>, general public opinion seemed even more in support of the bans after a number of mask wearing Antifa members beat up a reporter in Portland earlier this year. The argument against masks was that covering one’s face minimize the feeling of social disapproval and led to worse behavior.</p>
<p>The US has at times overturned mask bans, famously after the Iranian Revolution as a way to protect Iranian protesters in California. But those masked were protesting a government from which they had fled to the US. It’s a different story when the protesters are domestic.</p>
<p>But a different explanation emerged in the Hong Kong protests now that we have <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/emergence-of-omniscience-part-1-images/">identity at scale</a>. Protesters had already taken cautions to avoid identification by using single-use MTR (metro) transit cards and paying in cash. But faces could be identified at scale either live or in the near future by capturing records of protest attendance, assessing behavior, and following up with repercussions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters also try to take down eyes on the crowd in the form of smart lampposts. There are a number of videos of them <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/24/tear-gas-kwun-tong-hong-kong-protesters-surround-police-station-dismantle-surveillance-lampposts/">dismantling these lampposts</a> out of fear of surveillance.</p>
<p>For me it’s interesting to reflect on the news from Hong Kong because Hong Kong is a place I have visited over almost 30 years. During that time, I also lived there for around six years. Five of the visits and about one year of the living there was pre-Handover. In the time leading up to 1997, I observed (can’t really say I demonstrated) in a few events. These fell into a few types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marches, often along Queen’s Road, in crowds in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Sit-down demonstrations outside of the New China News Agency (the NCNA was the de facto Chinese embassy pre-Handover).</li>
<li>June 4th remembrances in Victoria Park (including the last pre-Handover one), often culminating in the crowd holding lit candles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwsPt854Xo">Cui Jian’s <em>Nothing To My Name</em></a> would always be played (a song popular at 1989 Tiananmen).</li>
</ul>
<p>No one wore a mask, because there wasn’t any need to do so. The protest leaders were already known. The crowd was safe in numbers. I never heard anyone fear identification, even post-Handover.</p>
<p>If you contrast the protesters of back then with those of the last six months, they are unrecognizable.</p>
<p>That protesters hide their faces and cut down smart lampposts makes sense. Like the eyes in the advertisements above, the lampposts may not have any intent to use facial recognition to identify protesters, but there is no trust. Anything can look suspicious. If the capability is there to help your adversary, then you assume they use it. Especially if there are examples of mass surveillance already in place, for example in the Chinese province of <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Xinjiang</a>.</p>
<h2>Consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identity at scale can weaken trust.</li>
<li>Visual symbols can spread a message.</li>
<li>Huang Yongyu’s owl paintings now sell at auction.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>By Nelson del Rio and Aaron Holm,<br>Co-CEOs, Blokable Inc.</strong></h2>

<h2>The following post examines the current housing market in the first of a series exploring the root causes of the American housing crisis and how public-private collaboration can chart a different course.</h2>

<div><figure><img width="1055" height="800" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjA0OCAxNTUzIiB3aWR0aD0iMjA0OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNTUzIiBkYXRhLXU9IiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyMCUyRjA5JTJGdXJiYW4tc3ByYXdsLTIwNDh4MTU1My5qcGciIGRhdGEtdz0iMjA0OCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxNTUzIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==" data-spai="1" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></figure></div>

<p>Housing is integral to social justice and economic opportunity, and it is the foundation for education and public health. In the U.S. the public sector regulates, enforces, and in some cases delivers housing in an attempt to uphold shared values and standards, address community needs, and drive economic prosperity. Over the past 20 years federal, state, and local governments have spent billions of dollars to provide housing stability to the under-served. Despite these efforts, access and affordability in the U.S. housing market have fallen sharply over time, and are likely to decline further amid the coronavirus pandemic and recession.</p>
<p>Even before Covid-19, the housing crisis threatened the economic prospects of an increasing number of Americans. Tragically, the impacts of housing shortages are felt most sharply at the lower rungs of the income ladder; for every 100 extremely low-income households, there are only 36 affordable rental homes on the housing market. Housing instability affects an ever-greater number of Americans — not only the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20there%20were%2038.1,17.4%20percent%20to%2016.2%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 million people who live in poverty as of 2018</a>, but the 38 million “cost-burdened” households who spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and the millions more who survive paycheck to paycheck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public officials across the country have discovered that no amount of housing subsidy can incentivize the market to work for the benefit of their communities, or meaningfully address the housing challenges they face. As the nation grapples with simultaneous public health and economic crises, improving housing access and affordability means getting down to brass tacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can a free market ever provide all of the housing needed in our society? Why is it that the public and private sectors are unable to achieve efficiency and fairness? The answer lies in the structure of the housing market and the housing development process itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The housing industry evolved from a local activity where land was abundant and neighbors worked together to build homes, to a land-constrained environment with a highly specialized and regulated industry. The permanent, physical nature of real estate combined with local health and safety regulations have shaped a housing industry that develops, finances, designs, and builds one project at a time, with all construction work done on site by local contractors. Architects, developers, financial institutions, contractors, and others compete to maximize profit and minimize risk in housing creation.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTIzMCA3ODUiIHdpZHRoPSIxMjMwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc4NSIgZGF0YS11PSIlMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMjAlMkYwOSUyRmltYWdlMDAyLTEucG5nIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEyMzAiIGRhdGEtaD0iNzg1IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==" data-spai="1" alt="" width="677" height="432" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"><figcaption><em>Competing and fragmented interests are strangling the housing market.</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Housing development is generally divided into market rate projects, financed by the promise of future renters paying full price, and so-called “affordable” projects, which rely on&nbsp; government subsidy to produce a home that is attainable at below-market rent. Yet market rate and affordable housing developers must work with the same available land and the same pool of industry participants — architects, engineers, contractors, etc. — to build their projects at the same industry rates. Affordable housing is actually more expensive to produce than market rate because the developer must pay additional costs associated with obtaining public subsidies and managing legal and financial compliance. Amid soaring demand in growing urban areas, per-door build costs for affordable apartments now range from $500K to $1M.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications are alarming. First, the industry is supply-constrained and can build only a fraction of the housing needed to meet demand in fast-growing areas such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area.&nbsp;Second, supply constraints mean higher building costs and a strong incentive for the industry to produce for the highest end of the housing market: luxury housing. Third, whether it’s private capital or public subsidy, the more money available to build housing in a given market, the higher the cost for this scarce resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many believe that construction innovations such as modular construction and panelized building systems save time and money, thus providing a solution to the upward spiral in housing costs. But traditional modular builders are wedded to the incentives of the real estate market. They have their own labor and material costs, profit requirements, and competitive pressures. Modular firms match their prices with conventional offerings like on-site framing and tout the speed advantage of modular technology, while their developer and general contractor customers simply pocket any savings that result. Rather than making housing more affordable, modular technology has functioned as a replacement input into an industry that historically has invested next to nothing in research and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, competition among modular providers actually discourages housing innovation, as a glut of commodity-priced modular solutions race to build the lowest quality product at the highest possible price. In our new era of Net Zero, climate resilient, and public health conscious development, this is no room for a race to the bottom in efficiency, performance, and durability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to popular and convenient opinion, the current housing market isn’t broken, it’s working perfectly as&nbsp;designed and in a very efficient manner. No one in this business will innovate to disrupt themselves. And if all the money in the world won’t fix housing, then perhaps we shouldn’t be trying to fix it at all. Perhaps we need to create <a href="https://blokable.com/solution/">a new housing paradigm</a> that leverages innovation to drive down costs, reduces the need for subsidies, and creates new wealth.</p>

									<p>Hackers are demanding a ransom to unblock computers at an Antwerp coronavirus testing laboratory, according to local press.</p>
<p>The lab, which processes 3,000 tests a day,  around 5 percent of the Belgian total, was hit by the cyberattack Monday, the Gazet Van Antwerpen <a href="https://www.gva.be/cnt/dmf20201228_97618766" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p>
<p>The hackers' aim was to blackmail the lab rather than steal any data, according to the lab's IT officials <a href="https://www.hln.be/antwerpen/hackers-leggen-netwerk-van-antwerps-labo-plat-en-eisen-losgeld~ac1ff689/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F" target="_blank">quoted in local press.</a></p>

<p>The lab has notified local authorities which are now investigating the incident. </p>
<p>The hack is just the latest to target coronavirus infrastructure. The European Medicines Agency <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1545933">was the victim of a cyberattack earlier this month</a>, while British vaccine producer AstraZeneca says it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1531784">was hacked by a North Korean-backed group in November.</a></p>

<p><em>Transcript lightly edited for grammar and flow.</em></p>

<p><b>OHH:&nbsp;</b>Hugo Turner is a writer and a researcher specializing in the history of anti-imperialism. He blogs at <a href="http://anti-imperialist-u.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">anti-imperialist-u.blogspot.com</a> and you can find him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hugoturner1969">@HugoTurner1969</a> and on Facebook as well. I'm excited to have him here to discuss his new article "Sullivan &amp; Cromwell: Capitalism, Intelligence, &amp; Fascism" which appears at <a href="http://libya360.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">libya360.wordpress.com</a>. This is an article about the infamous US corporate law firm that launched the careers of the Dulles brothers.</p>

<p>Thanks for coming on today, Hugo.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Thanks for inviting me.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b> Definitely. It's common on the left to talk about&nbsp;corporate power but it's kind of abstract. So what you've done here is you're focusing on one of the law firms that are so important. The real guiding hands of the corporate power. Tell us how corporate lawyers have affected our history.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_%26_Cromwell">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</a> was a premier Wall Street law firm but it served even more powerful entities like the multinational corporations. Before there was a CIA, the corporations had to carry out their own coups and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell was the law firm that you'd go to if you wanted that kind of thing done. United Fruit was another corporation that could carry out coups on its own.</p>

<p>As for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, I'm interested in it mainly because&nbsp;the most influential CIA director, Allen Dulles, worked at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, as&nbsp;did his brother, John Foster Dulles,&nbsp;who became the Secretary of State and was a major cold war architect. When I was researching I discovered that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell had created the Panama Canal and launched the coup there. They had&nbsp;done all that stuff that in school you learn was Teddy Roosevelt, but this was before Roosevelt&nbsp;was in office.</p>

<h3>If you want to learn how&nbsp;intelligence agencies and multinational corporations came to rule the world,&nbsp;you've got to research the history of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell because it's a case study of how things really work.</h3>

<p>If you want to cover the history of the corporations and&nbsp;the birth of our world where intelligence agencies and multinational corporations rule over us and&nbsp;there's really nothing ordinary people can do about it,&nbsp;you've got to research the history of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell because it's a case study of how things really work.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b>&nbsp;Let's start with the beginning of their history. You wrote basically this started from even before the Civil War.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Yes, there was two founders. Algernon Sydney Sullivan, he was before the Civil War. He was married to one of George Washington's descendants&nbsp;who brought him into the American aristocracy. She was very pro-slavery and pro-South and his clients were all like Southern businessmen who, when they needed business done in New York, they would use him.</p>

<p>He was actually locked up during the Civil War&nbsp;by the then Secretary of State William Seward for defending Confederate&nbsp;pirates. He was considered like treacherous for doing this. Today we would call them terrorists, basically, because they launched these ships that were pretending to be merchant ships and conducting raids&nbsp;until they were caught.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b> These were the Southern ships, the Confederate ships, right?</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Yeah, these were the Confederate pirates.&nbsp;So he was locked in jail but he was released right before his case&nbsp;actually went to trial and he won the case.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> His partner was actually the son of a Union officer. It was kind of like how Sullivan &amp; Cromwell always hedges it's bets or play both sides of the fence.&nbsp;There was a paradoxical side to the way they do things. Like they were the first firm to hire Jewish lawyers but then they were also central in doing business with Nazi Germany. Sullivan, the Confederate sympathizer,&nbsp;was the first to sponsor a Black lawyer to join the New York bar. That's just like an example of that.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Cromwell was the one who actually brought the firm into full success.&nbsp;Sullivan had his career, but there were many ups and downs. Then he gets this young guy, Cromwell, who was only 25 at the time to be his partner. Sullivan died fairly early on so it was really Cromwell that masterminded the rise of the law firm&nbsp;by working for people like J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, W. Averell Harriman, Goldman Sachs, etcetera.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b>&nbsp;And this is all like after the Civil War.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Yes.&nbsp;Sullivan died in 1877, so it was after that when really Cromwell was in charge.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b>&nbsp;Okay, so after the Civil War Cromwell's kind of taking over. How was he running it? You said here he&nbsp;helped JP Morgan create US Steel.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Yes, so at the time, there was a lot of&nbsp;anti-trust legislation. So the firm created this new thing called a corporation. This was actually just to get around this anti-trust legislation.&nbsp;And US Steel was like a steel trust that remained basically the most powerful -&nbsp;or like I think it&nbsp;was one of two powerful&nbsp;steel companies in the United States. For instance JFK went up against US Steel during the '60s before he was killed, because they were cheating the people with their monopoly.</p>

<p>Cromwell basically gave them the idea of creating a corporation, and he did all the legal work for it. That was kind of like what he would do: they would have states that were trying to pass regulations, they would create these corporations, then would disband the old ones and create a new corporation in a state that didn't have anti-trust&nbsp;regulations. And Cromwell had already gotten certain states to pass the laws and make them&nbsp;a corporate havens. Places like New Jersey for instance --&nbsp;they still have this thing where a lot of Wall Street firms don't pay taxes is because they're incorporated in New Jersey where these laws were&nbsp;passed. Basically&nbsp;they would have&nbsp;to barely pay any taxes and they could do whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>As he served&nbsp;corporate power, he rose and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell became the top Wall Street law firm. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, like most corporate law firms, was divided to associates and partners. It would hire the top graduates from law schools as associates, and then they&nbsp;would exploit them&nbsp;because these new graduates&nbsp;would hope to get to&nbsp;become a partner in the firm. They would just work all the long hours and do all the grunt work. The firm&nbsp;kept expanding the number of the associates. Some of them would die of overwork.</p>

<p>There was like a strange loyalty there too.&nbsp;People liked to work for Sullivan &amp; Cromwell because at least they got to immediately start doing important work, primarily&nbsp;because they were being exploited. Cromwell institutionalized this loyalty by creating the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Society which had a yearly dinner where every former associate could come back. So even people who left&nbsp;Sullivan &amp; Cromwell or who didn't make partners would go on to different influential positions in the corporate world and still be part of this society.</p>

<p>One of the strangest things they even maintained close relationships with people who applied but were rejected. One example is&nbsp;Richard Nixon. He thanked them for not hiring him. He stated once&nbsp;"If you had hired me, I'd be a corporate lawyer today, but thanks to you, I'm the Vice President." Ironically, he would lose his election for presidency and so he would go back to being a corporate lawyer before actually becoming the president in 1968.</p>

<p>Nixon was widely regarded as the Dulles mouthpiece while he was in congress, according to Peter Dale Scott. And Nixon and Dulles&nbsp;brothers worked closely together during the Eisenhower administration when Nixon was the Vice President and the Dulles brothers had their important positions at State and CIA.&nbsp;They&nbsp;were&nbsp;into all the secret operations, the CIA stuff.</p>

<p>Eisenhower was also very into it despite how he tried to paint this image of himself as kind of a "hands off" and "the nice guy". People know&nbsp;the Dulles Brothers were to blame but in this story it is crucial to see that&nbsp;Eisenhower is totally&nbsp;in on all of it. As was&nbsp;Nixon.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b> Interesting. So&nbsp;it was almost like a club for rich and powerful people as well.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> It was literally club. Because every year they would have this big dinner and all the former associates would attend&nbsp;and they would act out&nbsp;skits and stuff. It was like a yearly event. It was called the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell Society.</p>

<p><b>OHH:</b> Oh, it's almost like, with the skits and stuff, it reminds me of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtDDMfKYfMg">Bohemian Grove</a> or something like it. It sounds like&nbsp;they're similar things.</p>

<p><b>Hugo Turner:</b> Yeah, it's more like a network --&nbsp;It's sort of similar to those other kind of more infamous conspiracy networks. Everyone that's worked there and&nbsp;even people that didn't work there, like Nixon, had this kind of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell network. And as well, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell&nbsp;partners sat on the&nbsp;boards of directors of the client companies.</p>

<h3>John Foster Dulles was on like 15 boards of directors,&nbsp;just for one example. So all of these different American corporations became part of&nbsp;this&nbsp;Sullivan &amp; Cromwell network.</h3>

<p>John Foster Dulles was on like 15 boards of directors,&nbsp;just for one example. So all of these different American corporations became part of&nbsp;this&nbsp;Sullivan &amp; Cromwell network. Not that it's like all controlling everything from behind the scenes, it's one of the many networks that they created.</p>

<p>The Dulles Brothers also created the Council of&nbsp;Foreign Relations. They were there&nbsp;at the birth …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>2020-12-29</span></p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Motivation and method</h3>

<p>My password manager runs on my macOS desktop computer.
I wanted to print a plain text copy of my password list for storing in a safe deposit box.</p>

<p>I wanted to do this without having <i>any</i> files
that could contain unencrypted sensitive information
 ever being written to disk by the password manager or the print spooler, or travelling over any network.</p>

<p>This is the method I used:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a RAM disk on the macOS system.</li>
<li>Apply a sandbox to the password manager to restrict file output to the RAM disk.</li>
<li>Export a plain-text copy of the password list to the RAM disk.</li>
<li>Use AESCrypt to encrypt the text file.</li>
<li>Copy the encrypted text file to the Mac hard drive.</li>
<li>Unmount the RAM disk.</li>
<li>Modify a Raspberry Pi to allow booting from a flash drive.</li>
<li>Prepare a "Live boot" version of Raspbian OS on a flash drive with a hardware write-lock switch.</li>
<li>Boot the flash drive on a Raspberry Pi in writeable mode. (Do not use an SD card in the Raspberry Pi.)</li>
<li>Copy the encrypted text file to the flash drive.</li>
<li>Shut down and reboot the flash drive in write-locked mode.</li>
<li>Create a RAM disk on the running Raspbian system.</li>
<li>Decrypt the encrypted text file to the RAM disk.</li>
<li>Connect a simple USB printer to Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Print the unencrypted text.</li>
</ol>


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>RAM disk on macOS</h3>

<p>Following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46224103/create-apfs-ram-disk-on-macos-high-sierra">Create
APFS RAM disk on macOS High Sierra</a>
at stackoverflow, I created a RAM disk:</p>

<div><pre><code>sizeInMB=100
diskutil partitionDisk $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://$((2048*sizeInMB))) 1 GPTFormat APFS 'RAMdisk' '100%'

</code></pre></div>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>Sandbox app and export passwords</h3>

<p>Use of this unofficial sandboxing technique is described in more detail in the previous
post, <a href="https://7402.org/blog/2020/macos-sandboxing-of-folder.html">Sandboxing a third-party macOS app to restrict writing to one folder</a>.</p>

<p>In the following, <code>MyPasswordProgram</code> is a stand-in for the name of the
actual password manager in use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a copy of <code>MyPasswordProgram</code> and put it in a work directory, e.g.,
<code>~/Documents/Projects/Sandbox</code>.</li>

<li>Overwrite the entitlements.
<div><pre><code>cd ~/Documents/Projects/Sandbox
codesign --force -s - MyPasswordProgram.app/Contents/MacOS/MyPasswordProgram

</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>At this point, when I double-clicked the modified program it thought I was a new user with no data. I had to restore my data from
a backup. (<code>MyPasswordProgram</code> has a feature allowing backing up data to a separate file.)</li>

<li>Create a sandbox profile, <code>mypasswordprogram.sb</code>  to restrict file output:
<div><pre><code>(version 1)
(allow default)
(deny network*)
(deny file-write*)
(allow file-write* (subpath "/Volumes/RAMdisk/") )
</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Launch <code>MyPasswordProgram</code> with sandboxing:
<div><pre><code>sandbox-exec -f mypasswordprogram.sb MyPasswordProgram.app/Contents/MacOS/MyPasswordProgram
</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Export the plain-text password file to <code>/Volumes/RAMdisk/clear.txt</code></li>
</ol>

<p>My password manager offered a few options for the format of the exported file. Experimentation
revealed that some options used the technique of writing a temporary file (on the hard drive!) first.
Fortunately, the plain-text option wrote directly (and only) to the selected output location.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>Get AESCrypt command-line tool for macOS</h3>

<p>Although the <a href="https://www.aescrypt.org/">aescrypt.org</a> website has macOS binaries
available for download <a href="https://www.aescrypt.com/download/">here</a>, I opted to get the source
 and build it myself.</p>

<p>(I used <a href="https://www.aescrypt.com/download/v3/mac/aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source.tgz">aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source.tgz</a>, although there might be a newer version by the time you read this.)</p>

<div><pre><code>tar zxvf aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source.tgz
cd aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source
cd src
make

</code></pre></div>

<p>Using <code>sudo make install</code> after this did not work for me (on macOS High Sierra 10.13), so I
installed it by hand.</p>

<div><pre><code>sudo cp aescrypt /usr/local/bin
sudo cp aescrypt_keygen /usr/local/bin 
sudo cp ../man/aescrypt.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/

</code></pre></div>

<p>Since the theme is paranoia and because the AESCrypt folks make hash values  
<a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s109/sh/cc691421-314d-4777-aa49-fb6788735d21/fe3dbd23268b1b66e6be7c66ec0dfa91">available</a>, I did
verify the source code package before I built it.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ shasum -a 256 aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source.tgz
736cc8247dde220e553af35a0afd5708d20de4a7c40127b0d1069e5473e3a0df  aescrypt_mac_v314_1_source.tgz

<p>One of the authors <a href="https://forums.packetizer.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=367&amp;p=1329#p1329">says</a>,
however, in response to a request for a way to verify the files:</p>



<p>I confess I did not go so far as to verify the GnuGP signature of the file of
hashes itself. I didn't read the source code, either.</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>Encrypt with AESCrypt</h3>

<p>This asks for a password, encrypts the clear-text file from the RAM disk, and writes the
encrypted result to a work directory (on the hard drive).</p>

<div><pre><code>cd ~/Documents/Projects/Sandbox
aescrypt -e -o encrypted.dat /Volumes/RAMdisk/clear.txt

</code></pre></div>

<p>Unmount the RAM disk after this is done. (In a Finder window that lists all your devices
in the sidebar, this can be accomplished 
by clicking the Eject ⏏ icon to the right of the RAM disk's name.)</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi booting from flash drive</h3>

<h4>Flash drive</h4>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 needs an operation to allow for booting from a USB flash drive, in 
addition to usual ability to boot from an SD card. That operation is
documented in a previous post, <a href="https://7402.org/blog/2019/fix-broken-raspi-card-reader.html">Solution for a Broken Raspberry Pi SD Card Reader</a>.</p>
 
<p>The next step calls for a flash drive with a physical write-lock switch. I got
<a href="https://www.kanguru.com/storage-accessories/flashblu30-usb-flash-drive-with-physical-write-protect-switch.shtml">this</a> 8GB one from Kanguru:</p>

<p><img src="https://7402.org/images/kanguru.png" alt="Kanguru FlashBlu30 8GB flash drive"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<img src="https://7402.org/images/write-lock.png" alt="Closeup of write-protect switch"></p><p>This brings up the question, "<a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4248/how-reliable-is-a-write-protection-switch-on-a-usb-flash-drive">[StackExchange] How reliable is a write protection switch on a USB flash drive?</a>"

</p><p>The consensus is that it's pretty good.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>, however, the following gotcha from Kanguru's <a href="https://kanguru.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/228850167">support site</a> regarding
another one of their flash drives with a write-protect switch:</p>



<p>The above is consistent with comments on the StackExchange link.</p>

<h4>Install system</h4>

<p>Install Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) on the flash drive, and prepare
it for headless operation from first boot:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/">Raspberry Pi OS Lite</a>.
As of date current version was <code>2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip</code>.</li>

<li>Using <a href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2020-12-04/2020-12-02-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip">Balena Etcher</a>, write image to flash drive drive.</li>

<li>If Etcher has unmounted the flash drive, unplug and replug it.</li>

<li>The flash drive appears as a volume named "boot". Create an empty file named "ssh" on it.


</li><li>Create a file on the volume named <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
<div><pre><code>vi /Volumes/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre></div>
with contents similar to this, replacing <code>MyAccessPointName</code> and <code>password1234</code>: 
<div><pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
 ssid="MyAccessPointName"
 psk="password1234"
}

</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>To specify a static IP address, it is necessary to edit a file on the <code>rootfs</code> volume
on the flash drive, which is not accessible from macOS. Either use a physical Linux machine, or install
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> (along with the "VirtualBox Extension Pack" to get USB 3.0 access)
and use a virtual Linux system.</li>

<li>Mount the flash drive on the Linux machine.
When using Debian GUI, just plugging it mounts everything automatically. From the command line,
I used commands similar to following to identify the device and mount it:
<div><pre><code>$ sudo blkid
[...]
/dev/sdc1: LABEL_FATBOOT="boot" LABEL="boot" UUID="EBBA-157F" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="067e19d7-01"
/dev/sdc2: LABEL="rootfs" UUID="b3ce35cd-ade9-4755-a4bb-1571e37fc1b9" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="067e19d7-02"
$ sudo mkdir /media/michael/boot
$ sudo mkdir /media/michael/rootfs
$ sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/michael/boot
$ sudo mount /dev/sdc2 /media/michael/rootfs
</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Edit the file <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> using the appropriate path, e.g.:

<div><pre><code>sudo vi /media/michael/rootfs/etc/dhcpcd.conf
</code></pre></div>

and append the following (making the appropriate substitutions):
<div><pre><code>interface eth0
static ip_address=172.16.1.21/24    
static routers=172.16.1.10
static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

interface wlan0
SSID MyAccessPointName
static ip_address=172.16.1.121/24
noipv6
static routers=172.16.1.10
static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

</code></pre></div></li> 

<li>Unmount the flash drive. If using the command line, use commands similar to
<div><pre><code>$ sudo umount /dev/sdc1
$ sudo umount /dev/sdc2
</code></pre></div></li> 

<li>Boot the Raspberry Pi with the flash drive. (There should be no SD card installed.)
The first time it boots the flash drive, it may take a several minutes before it is
accessible for remote login.</li>

<li>Log in via ssh with the default user name <code>pi</code> and the default password <code>raspberry</code>, e.g.,
</li>

<li>Change the password.
</li>

</ol> 

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>Live boot Raspbian OS</h3>

<p>Configure the new system for read-only operation. This follows the
method given in <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/make-your-raspberry-pi-file-system-read-only-raspbian-buster-c558694de79">Make
your Raspberry Pi file system read-only (Raspbian Buster)</a>, which explains the
instructions which follow in summary only:</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a temp directory for user <code>pi</code>.

</li>

<li>Replace packages.
<div><pre><code>sudo apt-get remove -y --purge triggerhappy logrotate dphys-swapfile
sudo apt-get autoremove -y --purge

sudo apt-get install -y busybox-syslogd
sudo apt-get remove -y --purge rsyslog

</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Edit <code>/boot/cmdline.txt</code>
<div><pre><code>sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt
</code></pre></div>
and append at the end of the line

</li>

<li>Edit <code>/etc/fstab</code>

add the <code>,ro</code> flag to all block devices, for example:
<div><pre><code>proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
PARTUUID=2b404624-01  /boot           vfat    defaults,ro          0       2
PARTUUID=2b404624-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime,ro  0       1
</code></pre></div>
and append the following
<div><pre><code>tmpfs        /tmp            tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
tmpfs        /var/log        tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
tmpfs        /var/tmp        tmpfs   nosuid,nodev         0       0
tmpfs        /home/pi/tmp    tmpfs   nosuid,nodev,uid=pi,gid=pi         0       0

</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Delete/create files and create symlinks.
<div><pre><code>sudo rm -rf /var/lib/dhcp /var/lib/dhcpcd5 /var/spool /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /tmp /var/lib/dhcp
sudo ln -s /tmp /var/lib/dhcpcd5
sudo ln -s /tmp /var/spool
sudo touch /tmp/dhcpcd.resolv.conf
sudo ln -s /tmp/dhcpcd.resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

sudo rm /var/lib/systemd/random-seed
sudo ln -s /tmp/random-seed /var/lib/systemd/random-seed

</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Edit <code>/lib/systemd/system/systemd-random-seed.service</code>
<div><pre><code>sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/systemd-random-seed.service
</code></pre></div>
so the <code>[Service]</code> section looks like
<div><pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStartPre=/bin/echo "" &gt;/tmp/random-seed
ExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed load
ExecStop=/lib/systemd/systemd-random-seed save
TimeoutSec=30s
</code></pre></div>
</li>

<li>Edit <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>

and append
<div><pre><code>set_bash_prompt() {
    fs_mode=$(mount | sed -n -e "s/^\/dev\/.* on \/ .*(\(r[w|o]\).*/\1/p")
    PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h${fs_mode:+($fs_mode)}\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
}

alias ro='sudo mount -o remount,ro / ; sudo …</code></pre></div></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Small nits drain users over time; hard to see this yourself; hard to see in data; talk to users like they’re guests in your fine hotel.]</p> <p>How frequently do you find yourself mildly annoyed at software dysfunction? Tapping phone numbers in Google Calendar opens them in Maps. The Mac WiFi menu is slow. Google Docs doesn’t let you share external docs on mobile. Etc. Etc. Lots of small papercuts.</p> <p><strong>Low Energy</strong></p> <p>Do you ever report these bugs? I don’t. When I use something I’m usually trying to <em>get a thing done</em>. I’d be willing to, but I budget very little energy for this side-quest.</p> <p>For years I’ve had my email plastered on my Twitter bio. Recently I opened my DMs. Messages started flooding in. Where were these people? Did they not see the email address in the bio?</p> <p>I think the lesson from both of these points is that product usage follows a certain momentum and flow. Users might be willing to break momentum, but only slightly. You’re on Twitter. The way to message people on Twitter is through DMs. Not email. If there’s no DM option, well, whatever. Move on. Similarly, the user who experiences a bug with Google Docs isn’t going to go through the trouble to write a detailed report to Sundar. Too much energy, breaking from the flow of usage.</p> <p><strong>Energy Efficient Feedback</strong></p> <p>So how do you get feedback about your papercuts if nobody cares to report them? Two options.</p> <p><strong>1. Playtesting</strong></p> <p>Video games are a great place to study UX design, because the product <em>is</em> flow. Not sending emails. Not writing documents. Flow. You’re <em>in the zone</em> when you play a good game. Even the smallest micro cut breaks that. <a href="https://www.playtestcloud.com/">PlayTestCloud</a> is a popular tool for game designers. It lets you upload an APK, and instructs their testing audience to <em>narrate their thoughts</em> as they play the game.</p> <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RITE_Method">RITE method</a> is another example of this. I can’t recommend these strategies enough. The thing I’m about to suggest next will seem more exciting to hack on, but still – nothing will beat the above.</p> <p><strong>2. Changing Equations</strong></p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/bloomberg.png" alt=""></p> <p>This is a Bloomberg Terminal keyboard. Custom built, it includes a dedicated Help button highlighted above. Tap it twice, and you’ll get launched into an instant IM or phone call with someone at Bloomberg. 24/7.</p> <p>This is good, but I think there’s room to innovate further. I’d consider dedicating an entire block of your UI as an always-on textbox. I wouldn’t make it a button like Intercom. A textbox. Every little bit of friction matters! It should be in a prominent place, and it should never go away. Let the user know they can type anything in there and you’ll respond. Here’s the twist:</p> <p>When you do implement fixes, <em>announce and celebrate them</em>. Use Twitter, Instagram, whatever. Thank your users. What you’re doing here is both decreasing cost (fluid, always-on UI) and increasing the reward (social affirmation) required in order to give feedback.</p> <hr> <p>Hopefully these strategies help you identify your papercuts. I can’t recommend the first approach more. Talk to your users and get them to spool the logs of their mind to you. Even small numbers will do.</p> </article></div>]]>

    <p>Google AI recently released a paper, <em>Rethinking Attention with Performers</em>
<a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>, which introduces <em>Performer</em>, a Transformer
architecture which estimates the full-rank-attention mechanism using orthogonal
random features to approximate the softmax kernel with linear space and time
complexity. In this post we will investigate how this works, and how it is
useful for the machine learning community.</p>

<h2 id="the-kernel-trick">The Kernel Trick</h2>

<p>Before we talk about Attention, it is important to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method#Mathematics:_the_kernel_trick">kernel
trick</a>.
Gregory Gundersen gives a great explanation on his
<a href="http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/12/10/kernel-trick/">blog</a>, but we will go over a
brief summary here. This section is not completely necessary for understanding
<em>Performers</em>, but might provide some helpful context.</p>

<p>Say we have some data $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/circles.png" alt="circles"></p>

<p>We can see that this data is not linearly separable, i.e. if we wanted to fit a
logistic regression or linear support vector machine (SVM) to the data we
wouldn’t be able to. How do we get around this? We can map the data into a
higher dimension, say $\mathbb{R}^3$, using a function 
$\varphi : \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^3$:</p><p>

\[\varphi \left(\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} \right)
 = \begin{bmatrix} x_1^2 \\ x_2^2 \\ \sqrt{2}x_1 x_2 \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>This function $\varphi$ is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_kernel">polynomial
kernel</a> of degree $d=2$. If we
apply it to our data, $x$, we can visualize that it becomes linearly separable:</p>

<p><img src="https://teddykoker.com/images/poly_circles.png" alt="poly circles"></p>

<p>Now we can recall the expression for fitting a linear SVM:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j})\]

</p><p>Don’t worry if this expression is unfamiliar, just note that we are computing a
dot product between two samples $\textcolor{blue}{x_i^\top x_j}$, and repeating
this process many times.
If we want to use our kernel function $\varphi$ so that the data is linearly seperable,
we can simple wrap each $x_n$ with $\varphi$ to map it into a higher dimension:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j (\textcolor{blue}{\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)})\]

</p><p>Now we could stop here, but we can make this more efficient. What we have so far
requires computing $\varphi(x_n)$, $N$ times, and the dot-product
$\varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)$, $N^2$ times, which could start becoming very
computationally expensive, especially with kernel functions that map to very
high dimensions. How do we get around this? This is where the <strong>kernel trick</strong> comes
in. Suppose we had a function $K : \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}$
where:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>If we can find a $K$ that performs this operation in a lower dimensional space,
we can save potentially great amounts of compute. For the polynomial kernel
$\varphi$ defined above, finding $K$ is fairly straight forward (derivation is
left as an exercise to the reader):</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i^\top x_j)^2 = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j)\]

</p><p>We are now doing the dot-product in lower dimensional space, but we will get the
same result as performing the dot-product after the projection. This means we
can rewrite our linear SVM expression one more time:</p><p>

\[\text{maximize} \quad f(c) = \sum_n^N c_n - \frac{1}{2} 
\sum_i^N \sum_j^N c_i c_j y_i y_j \textcolor{blue}{K(x_i, x_j)}\]

</p><p>Now instead of doing a dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we are doing it in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. This might not make much of an impact in terms of computational
cost in this case, but it can make a much bigger difference with more complex
kernel functions and higher dimensional data. Next, we will see how <strong>Random
Fourier Features</strong> can reduce the computational cost of some kernel functions <em>even more</em>.</p>

<h2 id="random-fourier-features">Random Fourier Features</h2>

<p>In <em>Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines</em> <a href="#rahimi2007random">(Rahimi &amp; Recht, 2007)</a>
(which won the NIPS “Test of Time” award in 2017, ten years after it was
published), they set out to approximate $K$ using a randomized feature map 
$z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K(x_i, x_j) = \varphi(x_i)^\top \varphi(x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p>Specifically, they prove theoretically that the Gaussian or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel">RBF
kernel</a>:</p><p>

\[K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(-\gamma \lVert x_i - x_j \rVert^2)\]

</p><p>Can be approximated by sampling $z$ from the Fourier transformation. Concretely,
one way we can write this as is:</p><p>

\[z_\omega(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_ R(0, I) $ is sampled from a spherical Gaussian.
With this approximation, the dot-product no longer needs to be performed in
$\mathbb{R}^L$ space, it can now be performed in $\mathbb{R}^R$ space, where
$R \ll L$. How is this useful? <strong>Using Random Fourier Features, we can
approximate any function $K$ that can be written in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$.</strong></p>

<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://teddykoker.com/2020/02/nlp-from-scratch-annotated-attention/">previous blog post</a>, we went over
the <em>self-attention</em> mechanism, an how it was introduced for language
translation. Nowadays, most language models use <em>scaled-dot-product attention</em> as
defined in the <em>Transformers</em> paper <a href="#vaswani2017attention">(Vaswani et al., 2017)</a>:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) =
\text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right) V\]

</p><p>Where $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$, $L$ is the sequence length, and $d$
is some hidden dimension. We can expand the $\text{softmax}$ and rewrite
the expression as the following:</p><p>

\[\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = D^{-1}AV, \quad
A = \exp(QK^\top/\sqrt{d}), \quad
D = \text{diag}(A 1_L)\]

</p><p>Where $1_L$ is a vector of ones of length $L$. In Python this looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>attention</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>k</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>):</span>
    <span>l</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>q</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>q</span> <span>@</span> <span>k</span><span>.</span><span>T</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>**</span> <span>-</span><span>0.5</span><span>))</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>d_inv</span> <span>@</span> <span>a</span> <span>@</span> <span>v</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This $\text{Attention}$ method has some limitations however; if we
examine the attention matrix, $A$, we will realize it is of shape $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, meaning that any operation performed with $A$ will have a time
and space complexity that grows <strong>quadratically</strong> with respect to the sequence
length $L$. This puts a limitation on the maximum sequence length that can be
used with the Transformer, which means they are not usable for many tasks that
may require much longer sequence lengths, such as dialog, protein sequences, and
images.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, many have developed their own “X-former” to
reduce this complexity, and this is becoming a growing area of research; for a
full survey see <a href="#tay2020efficient">(Tay et al., 2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performer">Performer</h2>

<h3 id="softmax-kernel">Softmax Kernel</h3>

<p>The <em>Performer</em> <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a>  seeks to reduce the
complexity of Attention using random Fourier features. Using the equation above,
we can factor out the normalization component, $\sqrt{d}$, in the
computation of $A$:</p><p>

\[A = \exp \left(
\frac{Q}{\sqrt[4]{d}}
\left( \frac{K}{\sqrt[4]{d}} \right)^\top
\right)\]

</p><p>As we continue, we will assume that this normalization is applied beforehand, so
we can rewrite as simply:</p><p>

\[A = \exp(QK^\top)\]

</p><p>Now lets say we define a softmax kernel, $K_\text{softmax} : \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ as:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) = \exp(x_i^\top x_j)\]

</p><p>Using this softmax kernel, we can rewrite the computation of any element within
$A$:</p><p>

\[A(i, j) = K_\text{softmax}(q_i^\top,k_j^\top)\]

</p><p>Where $q_i$, $k_j$, represent the $i^\text{th}$,
$j^\text{th}$ row vector in $Q$, $K$, respectively.</p>

<p>Since the attention matrix is now written as the output of a kernel function $K_\text{softmax}$,
we could potentially approximate it at a <strong>lower dimensionality</strong> as we did for the Gaussian kernel above
feature mapping $z: \mathbb{R}^L \mapsto \mathbb{R}^R$:</p><p>

\[K_{softmax}(x_i, x_j) \approx z(x_i)^\top z(x_j)\]

</p><p><em>Note: <a href="#choromanski2020rethinking">(Choromanski et al., 2020)</a> uses $\varphi$ to denote this random
feature mapping, I am using $z$ for consistency.</em> Working from the definition of
the Gaussian kernel function, we can derive $K_\text{softmax}$
in terms of $K_\text{gauss}$:</p><p>

\[K_\text{softmax}(x_i, x_j) =
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_i \rVert^2}{2} \right)
K_\text{gauss}(x_i, x_j)
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x_j \rVert^2}{2} \right)\]

</p><p>See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for full derivation. With this derivation, we can
come up with our random feature mapping $z_\omega$ that approximates
the $K_\text{softmax}$ kernel using the Random Fourier features approximation of
the Gaussian kernel:</p><p>

\[z_\omega^\text{sin/cos}(x) = 
\exp \left( \frac{\lVert x \rVert^2}{2} \right)
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega^\top x) \\ 
\sin(\omega^\top x) \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Where, again, $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}_R(0, I)$ is sampled from a spherical
Gaussian. <strong>Now, instead of our attention matrix $A$ being of size $\mathbb{R}^{L
\times L}$, it is only of size $\mathbb{R}^{R \times L}$, with the sum of each
row approximating that of it’s full-rank counterpart.</strong></p>

<p>This looks quite complex at this point, but we can now write the full
approximated attention mechanism, $\widehat{\text{Attention}}(Q, K, V)$, in Python like so:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-ratio-heatmap.png" alt="Compressed bytes divided by original bytes, always less than 30%">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-headline-figures.png" alt="Savings from compressing logs as they enter the logging pipeline, several thousand dollars a month">
  <figcaption>
    Savings from compressing logs as they enter the logging pipeline
  </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

    <p>An agora, in its broadest sense, is a conceptual space where people attempt to bring an increased level of intentionality, explicitness, and mutual agreement to the principles and protocols for interacting in that space. A further aspect of the idea of an Agora is that it is a space which enables collaboration. In particular, it is a space that allows for collaboration guided by specific shared interests, without requiring the co-consitutients of the agora to be aligned more fully or generally in terms of their intentions, values, etc. </p>
<p>Some topics that the idea of an Agora is related to: <a href="http://anagora.org/node/transparency" rel="nofollow">transparency</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/decentralized-structures" rel="nofollow">decentralized structures</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/egalitarian-principles" rel="nofollow">egalitarian principles</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/algorithms-of-interaction" rel="nofollow">algorithms of interaction</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/communication" rel="nofollow">communication</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/collaboration" rel="nofollow">collaboration</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/knowledge-sharing" rel="nofollow">knowledge sharing</a></p>
<p>There are (infinitely) many possible variants of how this idea might be implemented in concrete, real-world situations. For example, an agora could be a space that is opened up inside a conversation between two people. Or it could be a collaborative project that is accompanied by specified rules. Or it could be a collective agreement about how to handle certain types of situations. </p>
<p>One variant of the idea of an Agora is a place where personal notes are shared, with the common goal of pooling information and sharing knowledge. One implementation of this idea is <a href="https://anagora.org/" rel="nofollow">https://anagora.org</a>. See also <a href="https://flancia.org/go/agora" rel="nofollow">https://flancia.org/go/agora</a>.</p>
<p>The term "Agora" and the basic idea come from <a href="http://anagora.org/node/flancia" rel="nofollow">Flancia</a>. </p>

This change, one of the name only, will clarify Ubiquiti’s current product offerings:</p><p><strong>UISP</strong> - solution for internet service providers, including UNMS, airMAX, EdgeMAX, airFiber, UFiber, etc.<br><strong>UniFi</strong> - end-to-end networking ecosystem for businesses and smart homes of all sizes<br><strong>AmpliFi</strong> - WiFi and routing products for consumers</p><p>This change will take place over the coming weeks -- in the interim, the “UNMS” name may remain in certain places.</p></blockquote><p>Ubiquiti also updated their <a href="https://operator.ui.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, emphasizing all the products and software that they make to support the operation of an Internet Service Provider. The tab on their website labeled "ISP" recently changed from <strong>airmax.ui.com</strong> to <strong>operator.ui.com</strong>. On that page they show off their AirFiber PtP Wireless Bridges, LTU and AirMAX PtMP radios, their excellent <a href="https://link.ui.com/" target="_blank">Network Design Simulation called AirLink, </a>UISP, UCRM, UFiber optical terminals, Solar switches, and accessories. As someone who works for a WISP, these changes caught my attention.</p><p>Beyond the name change and new marketing materials, not much is new. The latest stable software for UISP is still the 5-month-old version 1.2.7, with the 1.3.x versions in beta. The development of the 1.3.x train has had a few issues, with versions <a href="https://community.ui.com/releases/UISP-formerly-UNMS-1-3-0/54f99fa0-2e15-4f40-9895-5969d197b396" target="_blank">1.3.0</a> and <a href="https://community.ui.com/releases/UISP-formerly-UNMS-1-3-4/d762badc-8046-4b03-9ba3-982cbdc088b2" target="_blank">1.3.4</a> being locked, which is Ubiquiti's way of saying that beta release was broken and should not be installed. The comments on the <a href="https://community.ui.com/releases/UISP-formerly-UNMS-1-3-5/6c004887-1d86-4118-8097-e9fdbefe44bb" target="_blank">current 1.3.5 beta</a> aren't encouraging either, with some users saying they had trouble with that version as well. For now, we are stuck on 1.2.7. </p><p>If you’re familiar with Ubiquiti’s software development standards, this isn’t surprising. That’s the biggest knock I have against UISP and Ubiquiti in general — their software is rough, and requires careful investigation before updating. You can never assume it’s going to be stable and issue-free. Obviously, this isn’t a good quality for software that supports important network infrastructure. Ubiquiti’s hardware is cost-effective, but the software continues to let it down. </p><p>Beyond the software, there are some upcoming hardware products which can help shed light on what is next. There are 3 upcoming devices with UISP (previously UNMS) in the name. It's likely the UISP products will replace EdgeMAX, just like the UniFi OS devices (UDM and UDM-Pro) are replacing the USG and USG-Pro on the UniFi side. </p><h3>First, the bad news:</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Introducing-the-all-new-UNMS-Router-Pro/bf4d14e5-c026-4ac3-8e8a-05aa62c96c66#answer/53cb0bcb-db15-4e35-9f66-4a8c521a4d26" target="_blank">Ubiquiti states that their goal with the UISP devices is not to build feature-rich devices like the EdgeRouter or EdgeSwitch lines</a>. They want to build devices which will auto-configure with help of the UISP controller software.</p></li><li><p>The UISP series doesn’t have a CLI or an individual web interface. They are designed to be fully managed from the UISP controller software or via Bluetooth in the mobile app. Changes from SSH aren't preserved across reboots or updates.</p></li><li><p>The ARM CPU in UNMS Router Pro is same like in UDM Pro, and doesn't have any hardware offloading capabilities.</p></li><li><p>Just like the early days of the UDM-Pro, basic features like DHCP can be broken, and some features will be buggy, incomplete, or missing.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Ubiquiti claims they will have these basic router features ready for product launch:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Routing and VLAN configuration</p></li><li><p>OSPF (based on the FRR project)</p></li><li><p>Firewall/NAT</p></li><li><p>Switch configuration</p></li><li><p>DHCP server/client</p></li><li><p>ISP QoS for customers + suspend</p></li><li><p>Netflow</p></li><li><p>Speedtest</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>BGP and VPN support are coming “Later”</p></li><li><p>MPLS and PBR are not on their roadmap</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Ubiquiti’s goal of auto-configuration and a minimum feature set are at odds with what people expect from the EdgeMAX line and their other ISP-focused products. Without the flexibility of a fully-featured CLI for configuration, we have to rely on the features they implement in UISP. Instead of investing in what they had, Ubiquiti is choosing to build something new from the ground up. Just like with the Dream Machines, there will be features that were implemented or possible on the older equipment that aren’t present on the new equipment. </p><p>Part of this is necessary, and is what it takes to move to a more modern platform. On the other hand, it’s a self-own, where Ubiquiti’s equipment is losing features, losing flexibility, and best-case will result in a more restrictive “automatic” configuration which won’t fit every network. For the consumer and small-business focused UniFi line, this favoring of ease-of-use makes sense. I don’t think the same can be said of ISP networks, or those with serious networking needs. </p><p>Overall, proceed with caution. The UISP devices are not ready for production networks, which is why they are still in the early access store. The firmware and software aren’t finished, and not all features are present. Even when the UISP devices are released, Ubiquiti doesn’t claim that the UISP devices will be full-fledged replacements for EdgeRouters and EdgeSwitches. </p><p>With all those warnings out of the way, let's look at the 3 products that are coming.</p><h2>New UISP Devices</h2><h3>UISP Router Lite</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609252196521_32964"><div><p><strong>Router with (10) Gigabit RJ45 PoE Ports and (1) SFP Port</strong></p><p>The UISP-R-Lite is a fanless Gigabit router with PoE.  It has ten Gigabit RJ45 ports with Ubiquiti’s 24V passive PoE output, and one Gigabit SFP port for fiber connectivity.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>(10) Gigabit RJ45 ports with 24V passive PoE</p></li><li><p>(1) 1 Gbps SFP port</p></li><li><p>Powered by external AC/DC adapter (included)</p></li><li><p>Fanless, silent thermal cooling</p></li><li><p>Wall-mountable (kit included)</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth for easy setup via UISP™ app</p></li><li><p>Managed by UISP Controller (previously known as UNMS) version: 1.3.0-beta.4 or higher</p></li></ul><h3>UISP Router Pro</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609252196521_38494"><div><p><strong>Router with (2) 10G SFP+ Ports and (9) Gigabit RJ45 Ports</strong></p><p>The UISP-R-Pro is a high-performance router with (2) SFP+ and (9) Gigabit RJ45 ports. It supports dual-WAN ports: one 10G SFP+ and one Gigabit RJ45, and features built-in switching on eight Gigabit RJ45 ports.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>(2) 10 Gbps SFP+ ports</p></li><li><p>(9) Gigabit RJ45 ports</p></li><li><p>Powered by external AC/DC adapter (included)</p></li><li><p>Compact, durable metal case</p></li><li><p>1U Rack or wall mountable (kits included)</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth for easy setup via UISP™ app</p></li><li><p>Managed by UISP Controller (previously known as UNMS) version: 1.3.0-beta.4 or higher</p></li></ul><h3>UISP Switch Lite</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609252196521_41844"><div><p><strong>Managed Layer 2 PoE Switch with (8) Gigabit RJ45 Ports + (2) SFP Ports</strong></p><p>The UISP-S-Lite is a Layer 2 PoE switch featuring eight Gigabit RJ45 ports and two Gigabit SFP ports. The RJ45 ports support Ubiquiti’s 24V passive PoE, and the (2) SFP ports support 1 Gbps fiber uplinks. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>(8) Gigabit RJ45 ports with 24V passive PoE</p></li><li><p>(2) 1 Gbps SFP ports</p></li><li><p>24V passive 4-Pair PoE support on Ports 1-2</p></li><li><p>Total PoE budget: 110W when powered by included AC/DC adapter</p></li><li><p>Fanless, silent thermal cooling</p></li><li><p>Wall-mountable (kit included)</p></li><li><p>Layer 2 switching capabilities</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth for easy setup via UISP™ app</p></li><li><p>Managed by UISP Controller (previously known as UNMS) version: 1.3.0-beta.4 or higher</p></li></ul><h3>UISP Switch… Pro? (Not yet announced)</h3><p>Judging by the naming scheme, this product is inevitable, just like a <a href="https://evanmccann.net/blog/unifi-uxg-pro" target="_blank">non-pro UXG</a>. For now, there is no product named the UISP Switch Pro, but we can assume when it comes it will offer a few 10 Gbps SFP+ uplinks and a handful of Gigabit RJ45. To Ubiquiti, “Pro” means 10 Gbps ports. </p><p>If the UISP line is replacing EdgeMAX, I would expect other products here to to cover the range that EdgeRouters and EdgeSwitches cover as well. High port models, models with PoE and without, etc. There are a wide variety of EdgeMAX models to chose from, and over time I bet we’ll see that same variety in the UISP line. </p><h2>What About EdgeMAX?</h2><p>Ubiquiti seems to be abandoning their EdgeRouters and EdgeSwitches, which is a shame. </p><p>With these three devices in early access and no recent releases in the EdgeSwitch or EdgeRouter lines, the writing is on the wall. Just like how the <a href="https://evanmccann.net/blog/unifi-dream-machine-review" target="_blank">UniFi Dream Machine</a> and <a href="https://evanmccann.net/blog/unifi-dream-machine-pro-review" target="_blank">UniFi Dream Machine Pro</a> replaced the UniFi Security Gateway (USG) and UniFi Security Gateway Pro (USG-Pro), the UISP line of products are the next generation of EdgeMAX. This makes their goal of auto-configuration and lack of CLI that much more baffling. Ubiquiti claims to support what ISP costumers need, but their actions don’t line up with their marketing material. Whoever is in charge of product decisions at Ubiquiti doesn’t seem to understand what their products are used for, and they aren’t earning any goodwill with their most faithful customers.</p><p>Under the hood, the guts of the USG and the EdgeMAX products are old. They are both based on the open-source Vyatta networking platform using MIPS processors. Rather than continue to develop those, Ubiquiti chose to start fresh with a custom Linux codebase, and a new line of products using ARM processors. For UniFi, that became the Dream Machine and Dream Machine Pro. For EdgeMAX, we are getting UISP.</p><p>If you’ve followed the development of the Dream Machines and UniFi OS, you know what to expect here. With this transition comes software issues, missing features, and grumbling from the Ubiquiti faithful. Ubiquiti seems to see software-defined GUIs as the best solution, but their execution so far hasn’t backed that up. Until the software catches up with their vision, the lack of CLI and manual configuration hurts. Ubiquiti seems to be more interested in making pretty interfaces than making their products flexible, configurable, and stable.</p><p>For now and the foreseeable future, EdgeMAX are the most feature-complete devices, but I wouldn’t expect much development going forward. We shouldn’t expect any new EdgeMAX hardware either, judging by the UISP devices being in development, their rebranding, and their official comments in their community forums.</p><h2>My Assessment of UISP</h2><p>Now that we've covered what UISP is and what's changing, I want to quickly cover what I think of it. </p><p>As an overall package and from a distance, UISP seems appealing. Ubiquiti sells it as a centralized monitoring and billing platform, and in my experience it does some of that well. I’m just …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has now been updated 8 times since its launch back in October. The latest software version for FSD Beta is 2020.48.12.15, which is slightly on a different version path from the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/26/tesla-holiday-update-2020-48-26-is-here-v11-gets-delayed-release-notes-video/">2020.48.26 Holiday Update</a>.</p>



<p>The Dual-Motor Tesla Model S with the license plate shouting AIDRIVR has the privilege of being one of the few out there selected by Tesla for FSD Beta testing. In the following video, the owner and driver of this unique Model S takes his car for checking FSD Beta performance out in the snow. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Tesla Model S</a> in this video is equipped with summer-focused all-season tires, so traction and handling could’ve been better with the winter tires. Tesla’s <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s-19_-slipstream-wheel-and-winter-tire-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online shop</a> offers winter wheels and tire packages for the entire vehicle lineup. The Tesla Model S 19″ slipstream winter wheel and tire package range from $2,500 to $4,000. This Model S package includes the 4 x 245/45/19 – Pirelli Sottozero 3 tires.</p>



<p>In the newer Teslas, the Autopilot cameras are heated, so there is a lower probability of the car’s vision becoming blurred due to snow accumulation. </p>



<h2>In a snowy parking lot</h2>



<p>FSD Beta 8 in this series of tests is first evaluated in an almost empty parking lot with lots of snow. In the beginning, the car refuses to engage <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Autopilot</a> because of invisible road markings. Even when it accepts to be engaged in this snow-filled space, it gets confused and the driving is jerky, at last, it asks the driver to take over and disengages and comes to a full stop when not taken over.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/18/autopilot-fsd-beta-will-get-absurdly-good-says-elon-musk-v7-test-videos/">FSD Beta 7 test videos in different scenarios.</a></p>



<h2>On the snowy roads</h2>



<p>In the next phase, the driver puts <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a> on a snowy road to test if it works properly. Lane markings are pretty abrupt even after the heavy snowfall is cleared from the road. Lower grip because of non-winter tires is also a limiting factor here, Autopilot might handover the car to the driver if it feels the slippery situation is not safe.</p>



<figure>
<amp-ad width="100vw" height="320" type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0923072950810999" data-ad-slot="7514654329" data-auto-format="rspv" data-full-width="" i-amphtml-layout="fixed">
  
</amp-ad>
</figure>



<p>At the start of the test, Autopilot was able to predict the drivable space but on its own, it was following the posted speed limit of 30 mph. The cruise speed limit then was set to 15 mph manually, in order to be on the safe side in these snowy conditions.</p>



<p>In the drive ahead, the driver had to take over a couple of times, otherwise Tesla Autopilot was able to handle the path pretty well.</p>



<p>By watching the video closely and from the driver’s feedback it can be easily said that <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Tesla Autopilot (FSD Beta)</a> is not yet ready for snowy conditions. It will be a while before Autopilot fully learns snow and the scenarios it puts in front of a car driver. However, the video is still fun to watch and I like the owner’s commentary as he has a good grip on the topic of FSD testing.</p>

<p>On January 19, 2020, Washington state reported the first US case of coronavirus. By the end of March, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52103066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">245 million Americans</a> were under stay-at-home restrictions to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flatten the curve</a>.” Mainstream news terrorized the public with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/science/coronavirus-math-mitigation-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exponential</a> graphs, threats of a medical supply <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/hhs-officials-warn-of-medical-supply-shortages-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/573011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortage</a>, and displays of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnLCYqk20YU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hygiene theater</a>.

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide. Each year <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 million</a> people die of tuberculosis, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-malaria#:~:text=Almost%20half%20the%20world's%20population,global%20malaria%20control%20is%20slipping." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">445,000</a> die of malaria, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/cold-flu-sinus/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">290,000-650,000</a> die of influenza. In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale. These experimental restrictions were shaped by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discredited</a> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Imperial College Model</a> which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted</a> 2.2 million US deaths. Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>. In New York (the state with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second highest</a> covid deaths per million) hospitals sent over 6,300 elderly covid patients <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-york-hospitals-sent-6300-recovering-covid-patients-to-nursing-homes/2502812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back into nursing homes</a>. Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>. It is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as deadly</a> as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>



<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover. Millions of Baby Boomers have been forced into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/11/19/nearly-30-million-baby-boomers-forced-into-unwanted-retirement/?sh=4fb8019d5d7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early retirement</a> without adequate savings. Many Americans are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/americans-are-forced-to-raid-retirement-savings-during-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dipping into their retirement funds early</a>. The Congressional Budget Office projects that $2.8 trillion in Social Security funds will be <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/528268-covid-19-damage-to-social-security-to-extend-beyond-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used up in a decade</a> due to the impact of un- and underemployment on lowering contributions.</p>

<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by. Subscription platforms like OnlyFans saw a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-took-their-jobs-away-OnlyFans-let-15175650.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in accounts</a> at the beginning of lockdown. In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods. This devastation will be compounded by famine and the increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread of untreated diseases</a> like <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200624103257.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>. In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction. Many on the left chose to ignore the Biblical scale of the destruction that economic stoppages would cause, arguing that the covid crisis was an <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/quarantine-coronavirus-economy-left-organizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity</a>. Today the left continues to advance the illusion that <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meaningful relief</a> is possible, while workers’ pensions are plundered, children’s futures disappear, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/07/economy/global-poverty-rate-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 …</a></p></div></div>

<p>If you’re coming into tech from a different industry, or fresh out of college, the process of finding your first job can be painful and frustrating. I’ve seen a lot of new devs struggle with the application process. So, I put together a little guide for using one of the most easily accessible hiring resources: job boards!</p>
<p>Think <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>, <a href="https://www.monster.com/">Monster</a>, <a href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/">Career Builder</a>, etc… You’re likely familiar with these kinds of websites and have maybe used them before. They typically consist of creating a profile, then using keywords to search for open positions. There are lots of different kinds of job boards out there for developers. Some are specific to tech (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://www.cybercoders.com/">Cyber Coders</a>, <a href="https://www.dice.com/">Dice</a>), certain languages (<a href="https://vuejobs.com/">Vue Jobs</a>, <a href="https://www.rubyjobs.com/">Ruby Jobs</a>), lifestyle (<a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">We Work Remotely</a>, <a href="https://jobspresso.co/">Jobspresso</a>), and even values (<a href="https://www.diversifytech.co/job-board/">Diversify Tech</a>). These websites are incredibly helpful because they make applying for many jobs in a short amount of time easy. And because getting an interview is essentially a numbers game, that’s a huge advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, some people may be thinking, “I’d be competing against hundreds of applicants for every job. Why on earth would they pick a junior like me?” You’re not wrong. The amount of applicants for a position posted on a job board will be high. You’ll need to be pretty picky to break through the noise. But it’s doable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the approach that got me, and others I mentored, interviews from job boards: Refine your search so that you always have jobs to apply to, but not wide enough that there are endless pages. When I started out, I aimed to apply for three jobs a day. So my search was typically wide enough to return only a couple pages of results. I would apply to the top three most relevant to my experience. The next day, I’d apply to the remaining jobs if better positions hadn’t shown up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, I was regularly applying to jobs I didn’t feel qualified for. Junior positions aren’t always easy to come by on these websites. Often I was throwing my hat in the ring for postings that asked for 3 - 5 years of experience, and many of these did not result in a call back. But every once in a while, I did get an interview. There are a myriad of reasons for why this worked, but the TL;DR is: Job postings are not a perfect representation of what an employer needs.</p>
<p>Why is narrowing your search helpful? Let’s demonstrate with an example. Most career switchers transition into front-end development by first learning HTML &gt; CSS &gt; JavaScript. If you search for these keywords on a job board, you’re going to get a lot of results. This is because these keywords represent generic technology used across the entire industry. It’s equivalent to searching for a restaurant and typing “sandwich” in the search input. You’re going to get endless pages of options, from fancy restaurants to diners. How many actually reflect what you want? If you’re getting four or more pages returned from your search on a single job board, your keywords are too generic. One to three is what you should aim for.</p>
<p>So how does one “refine” their search?</p>
<p>The easiest way to refine your search is by picking a niche technology as your “specialty”. Perhaps you’ve heard this advice before. Picking a library or framework to specialize in will help you stand out from the crowd. Job boards are actually a great place to discover which niches are the most viable. The niche I chose when applying was Wordpress since I had studied PHP and saw several PHP positions that involved Wordpress. This approach will likely require some additional learning, but in my opinion, focusing on a niche is the fastest path to breaking into tech as a new dev.</p>
<p>You can also refine the search based on your previous, non-tech work experience. Yep, that’s right: your previous experience as a teacher, nurse, classical musician, or whatever can help your transition into tech. Certain industries, most notably finance and healthcare, actually prefer hiring someone from within the industry over outsiders. Having insider knowledge about regulations, lingo, or processes relevant to the company is a great way to break through noise and one that you can easily promote in a cover letter and resume.&nbsp;Employers will be thrilled to see someone they can easily communicate with and spend less time training.</p>
<p>Of course, results may vary depending on the type of job board you are using. Some are more popular than others. But a job board that has less search results might have less people applying on it. The main take away here is that you don’t want to spread yourself too thin. Throwing yourself at every opportunity will leave you exhausted and defeated. Instead, narrow your focus so you can act with pin point precision.</p>

<p><em>Five intersecting tetrahedra</em></p>



<p>2020 has raised many challenges, and has required incredible patience from all of us. Patience as we wait for life to get back to normal, patience as rules change suddenly and plans are cancelled at the last minute, patience with technology as we cope with frozen screens, muted microphones, and unreliable broadband. There has also been solitude – my last day in an office with colleagues was March 16th, and by the time restrictions lifted to allow co-working again, I had moved on from my job and become a full-time freelancer, so I now spend much of my time enjoying my own company. It turns out that time and patience are the two ingredients needed to make an origami model I’ve had my heart set on making for many years…</p>



<p>I first came across the <em>Five intersecting tetrahedra</em> model in “The Origami Handbook” by Rick Beech, which I bought when I was a student in around 2002 or 2003. The model was designed by Tom Hull, and you can read more about it on <a href="http://origametry.net/fit.html">his website</a>. When I first saw the model I wanted to make it but having made one tetrahedron I abandoned the attempt because my paper was too flimsy and I did not think all five would stay together. I didn’t return to the model for more than a decade.</p>



<p>The tetrahedra crossed my path again at Electromagnetic Field in 2018. Matt Parker had a harebrained scheme to create a lit-up version of five intersecting tetrahedra made out of wood, and a bunch of us helped hold bits of the framework to try to get the lines going over and under each other in the right order. This was where I first appreciated that in the model, you can pair off tetrahedra using different colours to help you; if you have a red tetrahedron and a blue one, then the point of the red goes through the base of the blue and the point of the blue goes through the base of the red. In the completed model, every face of each tetrahedron has one of the other four colours going through it. This helps with the construction, though it wasn’t enough for me to get my head round the 3D geometry. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMFtet-1024x982.jpg" alt="Five intersecting tetrahedra model in a field" width="674" height="646" srcset="https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMFtet-1024x982.jpg 1024w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMFtet-300x288.jpg 300w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EMFtet-768x736.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px"><figcaption><em>Five intersecting tetrahedra being build at EMF</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>My next encounter with FIT, as it’s known to its friends, was at <a href="https://www.talkingmathsinpublic.uk/">Talking Maths in Public 2019</a>. I was part of a collaborative effort to make the model, under the guidance of Philipp Legner, founder of the excellent Mathigon website. There are <a href="https://mathigon.org/origami/intersecting-tetrahedra">instructions on Mathigon</a> for making the FIT modules, and I’ve referred to these in making my own models. </p>



<p>I was delighted to be part of a group that successfully made the model but I was still determined to make my own some day. I thought that day might come in time for MathsJam 2019, when I gave a talk about dodecahedra. One way of understanding the five intersecting tetrahedra is by looking at the twenty vertices of a dodecahedron and partitioning them into five groups of four. I successfully created a <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/krkxkqus">3D GeoGebra construction</a> to help me better understand the geometry but I still couldn’t manage to put the origami model together – every time I tried I would get two tetrahedra together and part of the third and then become frustrated with which parts went over and which parts went under, and end up with battered and creased modules that were only fit for the recycling bin. MathsJam 2019 had to make do with a photo of the Talking Maths in Public model.</p>



<p>Fast forward to November 2020. I had spent a big chunk of the autumn doing origami; Fran Watson and I had put together webinars for Maths Weeks in Scotland and in England. I had also found that it was an ideal lockdown hobby – modular origami with its soothing repetitions kept me calm in a chaotic and frankly scary world. I had recently made a beautiful though complicated star from instructions on <a href="https://paolobascetta.com/">Paolo Bascetta’s website</a>, and this somehow gave me the confidence to go back to the model that had become my nemesis. If I didn’t have the patience and dexterity to do it now, then perhaps I should make my peace that I never would…</p>



<p>I cut the pieces from some A4 paper – the model is folded from 3 by 1 rectangles. Each tetrahedron is made from 6 edges, so 30 rectangles cut from 10 squares of paper are needed in all. I folded the modules gradually in spare moments until all 30 were ready to assemble. Then I put together the first two tetrahedra and got stuck again. It was the evening before Big MathsJam, and I thought to myself how lovely it would be if I could start my 2020 talk tying up the loose end from 2019. That gave me the motivation I needed. I read <a href="https://michal.kosmulski.org/origami/fit-five-intersecting-tetrahedra-assembly-tips.html">Michal Kosmulski’s</a> assembly tips, and then sat at my desk manipulating paper and comparing it with the diagrams. I got a third tetrahedron in, then a fourth, and finally, all five were together! I then proceeded to tell everyone I could think of, including Twitter! </p>



<p>So, what advice would I offer someone else who wanted to make this model?<br>Well, first of all, it’s much easier to make it once you’ve already made it! Having an actual 3D real life model to compare it to made the assembly of my second, third and fourth attempts much smoother than the first one. (Yes, I’ve got an origami problem. Yes, I’ve stopped making them now. Yes, I would make another one given half a chance.) For your first model though, it really does help to look at someone else’s diagram, so here’s a photo of one of mine with some notes that might be useful.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-768x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-225x300.jpg 225w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://alisonkiddle.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FITassemblyhelp-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"><figcaption>Note how the yellow point emerges through the orange face. Imagine the orange point protruding through the yellow face on the opposite side of the model.<br>Note also how the remaining three colours weave themselves around the three yellow edges, in a sort of knot.<br>Put these edges in place, and then make the visible points, and then finally turn the model round to complete the faces – I found it easier to make sense of the symmetry by building the third, fourth and fifth tetrahedra together rather than one by one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re a fan of modular origami and you have the patience to tackle a complicated model, (or the three-dimensional thinking to make it easier to visualise the assembly), I think it’s definitely worth making at least once. I made a version from shiny paper which I suspect will adorn my Christmas tree for quite a few years to come. Origami is a great tool for helping young people understand the importance of care, precision and perseverance, and while I wouldn’t necessarily teach this model in an origami workshop, I will certainly use it as an example to inspire!</p>

				<div><p>When most of us scroll through social media and inevitably <a href="https://cen.acs.org/careers/employment/Jealous-peers-stop-comparing-yourself/96/i46">compare ourselves</a> to those around us we feel <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201711/the-comparison-trap">crappier</a>, like we’re <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/11/16/new-research-shows-just-how-bad-social-media-can-be-for-mental-health/#67c5b4ee7af4">missing out</a> or <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/08/feel-like-youre-falling-behind-your-peers?">falling behind</a> in our personal lives or work.&nbsp; Not coincidentally, there’s also a growing understanding of <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/yale-happiness-course/">well-being</a> and happiness as subjective and adaptive: your happiness largely depends on your expectations. Your expectations adapt, however, and not only to your conditions, but to the conditions of those around you.</p>
<p>You probably thought your drawing in 5th grade was just fine until you saw Linda’s. And that’s also why as people get <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/rich-people-happy-money/577231/">wealthier</a> they aren’t necessarily happier – the comparisons and expectations keep changing – first you want the house, then the yacht, the island, a political office, then maybe a planet (close by). It’s easy to imagine then that for all of us being exposed to so many people’s lives exposes us to all sorts of conditions that appear in some way better than our own, setting our own expectations higher, and increasing the likelihood for unhappiness.</p>
<h3>Social Comparison</h3>
<p>There’s a lot understood about what actually matters for being happy, both with your life and in your life – social connections, time meaningfully spent, being healthy, appreciating what you have – and I completely agree with all of it. But I want to focus on the role of jealously and envy, which is often derided.</p>
<p>While social media has undoubtedly exacerbated social comparison and envy, their existence has been around for a long time:</p>
<p><em>“Whoever sang or danced best, whoever was the handsomest, the strongest, the most dexterous, or the most eloquent, came to be of most consideration; and this was the first step towards inequality…From these first distinctions arose … envy: and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness.”</em> –<em> Rousseau, On the Origin of the Inequality of Mankind</em></p>
<p>The natural response can be like the Stoics, to limit the exposure and stop comparing yourself to others:</p>
<p><em>“How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself.” – Marcus Aurelius&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>But while removing yourself from the barrage of updates and comparisons is essential to focus on improving yourself, that’s likely not enough. One of the methods for well-being is to identify something you want to improve, focus on it relentlessly, and compare yourself to your previous self. Not to other people who have what you want. Even imperceptibly small daily steps compound over time to make a big difference.</p>
<p><span>But while that gives you a way how to improve, it’s less clear what you should focus on.</span></p>

<h3>Envy is as Envy does</h3>
<p><span>Envy and </span>jealousy aren’t considered good things for a good reason. They feel bad mentally and physically. They gnaw at you, and make you doubt yourself. They’re also often considered <a href="https://people.whitman.edu/~frierspr/The%20Moral%20Value%20Of%20Envy.pdf">immoral;</a> something we should be ashamed of feeling and thus hide. But they’re also normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">emotions</a> most <a href="https://www.psychalive.org/how-to-deal-with-jealousy/">have experienced</a>. Sometimes they’re unproductive and should be restrained, but they may actually be quite useful in pointing us toward what we should focus on.</p>
<p>Although we still don’t quite understand what emotions are, they’re not completely mysterious either. We’ve come to understand that our experience of anger, happiness, or envy, is the result of unconscious and biochemical reactions in our brain that while similar, are not the same for all of us. Studies have also found that emotions highlight what’s important for us to pay attention to; we remember things better for longer when there is an emotion involved. Our personal blend of culture, experiences, and genetics gives rise to different emotional reactions from different phenomena for each of us.</p>
<p>For example, for many reasons I’m not a bit envious of Beyoncé’s success, but if I was a musician, or had known her school, or wanted to be famous, I may be. More likely my jealousy is aroused from a good idea that someone had or academic paper published on a topic I’m interested in, or a previous colleague of mine getting a promotion or launching a successful product. We don’t tend to be jealous indiscriminately, but when there is some closeness or familiarity, some perceived shared trait or path that could have been followed.</p>
<p>The problem is it’s often hard to pinpoint the target of an emotion like envy; we see something, we feel something, but it takes time and introspection to figure out what the root cause really is. It may start from the visible perception of another’s achievements, but underneath there are traits, skills, or circumstances that are worthy of admiration and contributed to that achievement. When you recognize those traits you can distill them into goals, and then they serve as a direction for you to strive toward.</p>
<p><em>When envy is inevitable, it should be used as stimulus. -Bertrand Russell</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sbp-journal.com/index.php/sbp/article/view/5977/0">Studies</a> have also found that “benign envy can lead to risk taking and self-improving behavior”.&nbsp; The point isn’t to feel envy and have it build toward resentment. We likely won’t get exactly what we want, and it’s possible our feelings are misguided, but as Nietzsche wrote by acknowledging the target of our envy as an aspiration and embracing it we understand where we can grow to be more fulfilled. Along with other emotions, envy helps humans direct our efforts, but machines operate quite differently.</p>
<h3>Emotional Algorithms</h3>
<p>Emotions are often positioned as counter to intelligence. While intelligence has many definitions, often it is defined as the ability to learn, integrate information, and apply it to solve problem with self-awareness and conscious reasoning. While machines aren’t self-aware or conscious, we do build AI systems to solve problems that would require those traits in humans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, emotions have long been thought of as interfering with our reasoning. Many behavioral and economic theories of the recent centuries were built on the notion of a rational actor making reasoned, rational choices. Behavioral research however has shown this to be lie: human decisions are usually based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">biased heuristics and emotional reactions</a>, not rational thought.</p>
<p>However, this dichotomy of emotions as separate from intelligence is itself misleading. While emotions may be unconscious and perceived as irrational, the existence of similar limbic systems, which give rise to emotions, in the brains of much more primitive animals suggests emotions are also likely a type of intelligence developed for our survival. Emotions and feelings may be biochemical algorithms suited to help us navigate the world by performing quick pattern recognition and instigating behavioral responses without taxing our limited conscious cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Let’s consider emotions to be a set of pre-tuned algorithms that have “learned” necessary basic behaviors over millennia and passed that knowledge to you in your genetic code. Your instincts may malfunction, and you may be afraid of things you shouldn’t be, or attracted to what is harmful: we all have flaws. But that doesn’t mean you should discount them. On the contrary, by paying attention to them you can fine tune those instincts through your active, conscious efforts, and even override them.</p>
<p>Our quick, emotional response, described by Kahneman as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">system 1</a>, can be loosely compared to how we build AI systems using machine learning, from the bottom-up, using data to fine tune a model for specific tasks through experiential learning. The conscious, rational ability, described as system 2, can analogously be compared to rule- or logic-based AI systems built top-down, directly encoding knowledge and directions.</p>
<p>In order to build a system with machine learning, you need to specify how the system will measure its success as it’s learning. This determines what it considers valuable, and conversely, what it’s penalized for not performing well on. The algorithm will dutifully make calculations and optimize toward any predetermined value function you impose. Human emotions like envy provide us with a recognition that something of value is missing: our physical or emotional suffering can be interpreted as a sign we’re penalized for it, and if we take steps to optimize our lives toward it we may be better off. An emotional reaction provides initial motivation for doing something different than what we already are. The approach to machine learning shares some characteristics with system 1, but taking a step back to the broader view of how the two systems work together, there is no analogous recognition from the algorithm that something is missing to serve as a motivation for changing the value function. That seems to be one crucial missing piece for intelligence.</p>
<h3>An Emotional Turing Test</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a> and its variants, where a machine tries to imitate a human in conversation, are considered one major benchmark for <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90590042/turing-test-obsolete-ai-benchmark-amazon-alexa">measuring intelligent behavior</a>. Usually the question is posed as can machines think? But at our core humans are an emotional animal. It’s much more natural for us to have irrational emotional responses, and only afterward layer on rational thinking. Maybe a more complete measure of intelligence would be based on the ability to both leverage your emotions to direct conscious thinking and learning, and ignore and override them when necessary.</p>
<p>AI systems can be trained to identify human emotions, with applications like sentiment analysis or facial recognition, but that doesn’t translate to experiencing those emotions, just recognizing them. I’m not suggesting we should translate the experience of human emotions in a machine, but would something that serves a similar role be useful? If so, what would it be?</p>
<p>What if an algorithm could recognize when the value function it’s trying to optimize wasn’t actually helping it learn what it’s trying to learn, or do what it’s trying to do, and it updated the value function on its own to perform better. Not simply choosing from a set of predetermined value …</p></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>

            <p>Researchers at the University of Turku have discovered what type of neural mechanisms are the basis for emotional responses to music. Altogether 102 research subjects listened to music that evokes emotions while their brain function was scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The study was carried out in the national PET Centre.</p>
      
      <div>
              <div>  <div>
          
            <div><p>The researchers used a machine learning algorithm to map which brain regions are activated when the different music-induced emotions are separated from each other.</p>

<div><p>– Based on the activation of the auditory and motor cortex, we were able to accurately predict whether the research subject was listening to happy or sad music. The auditory cortex processes the acoustic elements of music, such as rhythm and melody. Activation of the motor cortex, then again, may be related to the fact that music inspires feelings of movement in the listeners even when they are listening to music while holding still in an MRI machine, says Postdoctoral Researcher <strong>Vesa Putkinen</strong>.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The researchers also discovered which brain regions are activated when the research participants watched videos that evoke strong emotions, and tested whether the same regions were activated when the participants were listening to music that evokes emotions.</p></div>

<p>The results suggest that the emotions evoked by films and music are partially based on the operation of different mechanisms in the brain.</p>

<p>– Films, for instance, activate the deeper parts of the brain that regulate emotions in real-life situations. Listening to music did not strongly activate these regions nor did their activation separate the music-induced emotions from each other. This may be due to the fact that films can more realistically copy the real-life events that evoke emotions and thus activate the innate emotion mechanisms. As for the music-induced emotions, they are based on the acoustic characteristics of music and coloured by cultural influences and personal history.</p>

<p>Traditionally, music-induced emotions have been studied through classical instrumental music.</p>

<p>– We wanted to use only instrumental music in this study as well, so that lyrics did not impact the emotions of the research subjects. However, we included film music and songs by the guitar virtuoso <strong>Yngwie J. Malmsteen</strong>, notes Putkinen.</p>

<div><p>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/uq3R-LmrC-k">The video shows</a> how the brains of a hundred volunteers react while listening to Far Beyond the Sun by Yngwie J. Malmsteen. https://youtu.be/uq3R-LmrC-k</p><p>
&nbsp;
&gt; The study has been published in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa373/6046263?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Celebral Cortex journal</a>.</p></div>

<p>&gt; The research group is also conducting a study on music-induced emotions in the body. <a href="http://onni.utu.fi/consent?exp_id=158">Participation is possible online</a>.</p>

There wasn't much to consider in the era of cassette tapes and compact discs. Alas, that simplicity began to fade away in the early 2000s and now it's gone. Headphones are complex. Look at any product description and you're certain to find jargon, unexplained acronyms and lots of jazzed-up names for proprietary technology. Even technophiles struggle to keep up.</p><p><strong>This is a reference guide, not a buying guide.&nbsp;</strong>The definitions below are meant to answer a specific question that you might have. Take what you need and leave the rest (as if you were looking up a word in a dictionary).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608812731836_4550"><div><h2><strong>Audio</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Amplified</strong> headphones usually aren't as special as their marketing suggests: All active noise-cancelling headphones have a built-in amplifier. However, some high-end passive headphones are amplified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Binaural calls</strong> is another way of saying that a headset is stereo capable.</p></li><li><p>Headphones with <strong>equalization</strong>, or EQ, allow the wearer to emphasize, minimize or balance parts of the audio spectrum. (E.g. Boost vocals or lower the bass.) Some headphones have preset equalization settings while others allow full control of the audible frequency range, usually via a smartphone app.</p></li><li><p>Many headphones have a <strong>frequency response</strong> of 20Hz to 20,000Hz, which is the audible range of human hearing. These numbers offer little clue to how a headphone will actually sound. Frequency response is best measured with respect to sensitivity (+/- X dB). The closer to 0dB, the better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hi-Res Audio (HRA)</strong> is any audio format that exceeds the 16-bit/44.1kHz standard found on compact discs. HRA cannot be reproduced over a Bluetooth connection, regardless of a headphones' quality.</p></li><li><p>The only true <strong>lossless</strong> audio file is the original studio master recording. However, uncompressed audio that is recorded and played back at 24 bit/96 kHz or higher is often referred to as "lossless." High quality headphones are capable of replaying lossless audio over a wired connection.</p></li><li><p>Headphones and earbuds with low <strong>impedance</strong> (denoted in Ωs) require minimal power to play at loud volumes. As a result, low impedance headphones are susceptible to blow outs. On the other hand, headphones with high impedance require stronger amplification, but are less likely to be overloaded.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sensitivity</strong>, denoted in dB, indicates how effectively a headphones' drivers can turn power into sound. Headphones with 100dB of sensitivity will sound approximately twice as loud as those with 90dB of sensitivity, all else being equal. (Perceived “loudness” doubles with every 10dB increase in sensitivity.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sound pressure level</strong> (SPL), denoted in dB, indicates how loudly a headphone will play. Many headphones are capable of delivering sound pressure levels above 85dB, which can cause hearing loss.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spatialization</strong> and localization are the abilities of a headphone to create a virtual space within the listener's mind, then, to pinpoint sounds within that space. For example, being able to hear footsteps approach from behind in a video game or being able to hear the distinct location of each instrument in a musical recording. These effects can be achieved through traditional stereo imaging or via software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tuned drivers</strong> is another way of saying that an audio engineer has tweaked the acoustics of the headphones. Any legitimate pair of headphones will have tuned drivers. This is a marketing term that is used to emphasize the organization or the specific engineer who was responsible for the tuning. (E.g. Tuned by Meridian Audio.)</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Battery</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>mAh</strong> is shorthand for milliampere hour and is used to denote the capacity of the batteries found in headphones and charging cases. For reference, a AA battery has around 2,500 mAh.</p></li><li><p><strong>Playtime</strong> is the battery life of a wireless headphone that is in continuous use.</p></li><li><p>When a pair of headphones and its power adapter are both <strong>Qualcomm Quick Charge</strong> compatible, it allows the headphones to charge rapidly over USB without overheating.</p></li><li><p>Headphones and earbuds that support <strong>Qi charging</strong> can be wirelessly charged using a <a href="https://www.goodcheapandfast.com/articles/best-wireless-chargers">Qi-certified charger</a>, or, may contain a wireless charging case that uses the Qi (pronounced <em>CHEE)</em> standard.</p></li><li><p>Many battery-powered headphones include a <strong>USB Type A/B to Micro USB</strong> charging cable.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Hardware</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Headphones with <strong>24-bit audio signal processing</strong> have a built-in digital to analog converter (DAC) that is capable of transmitting audio at a higher quality than a compact disc (over a wired connection).</p></li><li><p>An <strong>AMS 3415</strong> chip allows active stereo noise reduction of 20dB or more.</p></li><li><p><strong>AUX</strong> is shorthand for auxilliary, which means a 3.5mm TRS unbalanced stereo headphone jack.</p></li><li><p><strong>BassTurbo</strong> is a design feature found in Anker Soundcore earbuds. By adding a tubular gap behind the earbud's driver, bass frequencies are emphasized via physics (i.e. without the aid of software).</p></li><li><p>Some headphones have <strong>braided cables</strong> that are designed to minimize tangles, improve durability or retain shape. Braiding can also decrease interference or resistance, but the impact usually isn't audible.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>driver size</strong> of a headphone (or earbud) is the diameter of its diaphragm, denoted in millimeters. A larger driver is capable of moving more air, but it doesn't necessarily sound better than a smaller driver.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic drivers</strong>, or neodymium drivers, use a high-powered magnet to move a diaphragm, resulting in sound waves. Many headphones use dynamic drivers because of their low cost and power requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ear tips</strong> are interchangeable cushions that allow earphones to fit within the ear canal as desired. Many ear tips are made from silicone (more durable) or memory foam (better at isolating outside sounds).</p></li><li><p>An <strong>FPC antenna</strong>, or flexible printer circuit antenna, is small enough to be mounted on a circuit board.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>H1 chip</strong> is an Apple-designed processor that is made specifically for headphones.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Sony's <strong>HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1e </strong>supports hybrid active noise cancellation within earbuds.</p></li><li><p>Some headphones include a <strong>jack adapter</strong> that converts the 3.5mm plug into a 1/4" stereo phone jack.</p></li><li><p>An <strong>LDS antenna</strong> is made with a laser direct structuring process, which allows the antenna to be wrapped internally on a plastic housing (i.e. "we hid the antenna inside the headphones").</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Litz wire</strong> is a type of braided cable that reduces electrical resistance. This type of cable braiding has practical applications (in Qi wireless chargers, for example), but it is unlikely to impact audio quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Microsoft adapter</strong> is shorthand for the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter, which allows most wired stereo gaming headsets to work with the Xbox One. Some headphones include a generic adapter.</p></li><li><p><strong>QCC3003</strong> is the model number of an entry-level system-on-chip (SOC) made by Qualcomm. It supports features like cVC 8.0 and Bluetooth 5.0 and is often found in low-cost Bluetooth headsets.</p></li><li><p><strong>QCC3024</strong> is the model number of an entry-level system-on-chip (SOC) made by Qualcomm. It supports voice assistant touch controls and is found in low-cost "smart headphones."&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>QCC5124</strong> is the model number of a versatile system-on-chip (SOC) made by Qualcomm. It supports 192kHz 24-bit audio, digital assistant usage, aptX HD and all forms of active noise cancellation.</p></li><li><p>Gaming headsets that contain <strong>RGB LED</strong> lighting are capable of reproducing more than 16 million hues.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>stable CSR chip</strong> may refer to a low-cost Bluetooth radio that was manufactured by Cambridge Silicon Radio prior to the company's acquisition by Qualcomm in August 2015. However, Qualcomm continues to use the initials “CSR” on some wireless audio systems-on-chips (SoCs). E.g. CSR101x Series.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>transmitter</strong> is another name for the Bluetooth radio found within headphones, earbuds and headsets.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>TRS audio cable</strong> is a stereo headphone cable, however many non-headphone TRS cables are in fact monaural. The acronym “TRS” merely describes the design features of the cable: tip, ring and sleeve.</p></li><li><p>Some wired headphones connect via a <strong>USB-C</strong> plug. This type of connection is compatible with certain smartphones and laptops that no longer support a 3.5mm stereo jack.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Materials</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>ABS</strong>, or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is a versatile, durable and recyclable type of plastic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Graphene drivers</strong> are speaker diaphragms that are made from a hexagonal pattern of carbon atoms. Graphene is lightweight, strong and highly conductive. It's also expensive. Some manufacturers might be stretching the truth when they claim to use graphene drivers, especially in cheap headphones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leatherette</strong> is a type of vinyl or plastic that simulates the look of leather.</p></li><li><p>"<strong>Memory protein earmuffs" </strong>is a poorly-worded translation of <em>polyurethane foam enclosed in protein-infused synthetic leather</em>, or headphone ear cups made from memory foam and leatherette.</p></li><li><p><strong>OFC</strong> stands for oxygen-free copper, which is sometimes written as OFHC, or oxygen-free high thermal conductivity copper.

<p>Below is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are
freely available online, usually because they are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open textbook (such as PLAI, SF, or the HoTT book)</li>
  <li>An older book that is out of print, for which the copyright has returned to the original author(s)
(such as TTFP)</li>
  <li>An author’s own preprint or draft of a textbook.  This includes cases where the author has made
special arrangements with a publisher to host an electronic copy of a published text on their
homepage while it remains in print.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these I’ve only used for brief personal reference, and have not read in depth.  The exceptions, those books I’ve spent considerable time with and highly recommend, are marked with asterisks.</p>

<p>I also include below a list of papers I consider good stand-alone introductions to certain topics, and a list of links to thorough special topics courses.</p>

<p>If you find one of the links below is broken or has moved, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Those with time to spare and looking to have less of it may enjoy browsing the QA call numbers in <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">UPenn’s extensive listing of online books</a>.  Most of those listed here were found independently over the years, but I’ve just now (June 2020) learned of this excellent repository of links.  I’ll add to the links below as I find promising books.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span>Back in November, Instagram reached out to me and asked me to schedule a call with them so a media expert from the Instagram Partnerships team could give me advice on how I could grow my account.&nbsp;I shall now share the results of my espionage with you 🐸</span></p>

<p><span>For privacy reasons, I'll refer to the person I spoke to as Mr. Ig. I got a ton of really useful information out of this call, and I will probably have to write multiple articles to cover it all. The most important thing I learned was that Instagram’s algorithm will either </span><b>reward</b><span> or </span><b>punish</b><span> you based on your usage of the app as a whole. There are over 500 different factors, but it takes much more into account than just the likes, views, comments, etc of a specific post. </span><b>The algorithm ranks your specific post by taking into account your use of Instagram as a </b><b><i>whole</i></b><b>.</b></p>

<p><span>Think of it like the algorithm is grading you in a class. One test alone doesn’t determine your whole grade - there’s still participation points, homework, classwork, projects, and more. You’ve gotta participate&nbsp;throughout the class as a whole, not just show up for one test and get an A on it.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Here are the top 3 things I’ll cover on what you should be doing to make your Instagram engagement suck less:</strong></h3>
<h3><span>1. Reels</span></h3>
<h3><span>2. Use all of Instagram’s features</span></h3>
<h3><span>3. Consistency</span></h3>

<h2><b>why things suck #1: no feelies, only reelies</b></h2>

<p><span>Reels are a new Instagram feature, meant to be a competitor to TikTok. They haven't been rolled out in every country yet. Reels are the current cheat code to success for Instagram right now. They are also one of the reasons why so many people saw their engagement tank this fall. This is because </span><b>reels are currently boosted in the algorithm. </b><span>Once the reels feature isn’t so new a few months from now, it will likely be downgraded to normal weight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<h3><span><span>✨ <strong>If you are not posting at least 1 reel a week, the algorithm is going to punish </strong></span><strong><i>all </i>your posts. ✨</strong></span></h3>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Example:</span></p>
<p>a) I post a reel on Monday. I make normal posts on Tuesday - Friday. All my posts for this week will see higher engagement because of this.</p>
<p>b) I haven’t posted a reel in 2 weeks. My engagement for this past week has absolutely tanked. Once I post a reel again, the posts that follow have a much better shot at seeing more engagement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>According to Mr. Ig, the Ideal™️ amount of reels per week is 4-7. Unfortunately, this is a bit difficult to do, thanks to the fact that a majority of people have lives outside of this app.</span></p>
<br>
<h5><span>Mr. Ig: so do you think you could be making 4-7 compelling reels per week for the next month or so?&nbsp;</span></h5>
<h5><span>me, a full time student and shop owner, laughing in disbelief: uh no not really&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0339/7061/8505/files/ahahahah_480x480.jpg?v=1608511259" alt="crying while laughing frog"></p>

<p><span>who the hell has the amount of time and mental health required for all that?? not me binch!!! So, my advice to you as a human who enjoys keeping what is left of my sanity intact, is to try to do a minimum of </span><b>one reel per week</b><span>. if you’re feelin it.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0339/7061/8505/files/sanity_480x480.jpg?v=1608511747" alt="Rainylune's advice: 1 reel per week"></p>

<p><span>Instagram currently has a team that is dedicated entirely to just finding good reels for them to promote. If your reel is chosen to be featured, they’ll choose to show it to more people for around a month, leading to a ton of views. But keep in mind that the promo team is Specifically looking at the back end for reels that were made using Instagram’s in app editor. which means no recycling tikt oks. You can still have recycled videos do really well, but this basically disqualifies you from being chosen by the team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<h2><b>why things suck #2: instagram wants you to use all their features :)&nbsp; a l l &nbsp; o f &nbsp; t h e m :) and use them often :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>aka “you will be graded for this class based on participation throughout the semester”</span></p>

<p><span>Instagram likes it when you are spending all your time on the app :) and using all of their available features aside from normal feed posts :) They like it when you post a </span><b>combination</b><span> of normal posts, reels, IGTV, stories, shoppable posts, etc etc. You know those little events they do in stories like the “I Voted” sticker? participate in that school spirit kinda junk. The algorithm likes it when you use the in app camera and filters, geolocation tagging, messaging, story buttons, all that stuff. use app more. have many different thing to offer you :) sell your soul :)</span></p>

<h3><strong>Instagram’s Highly Unrealistic Ideal Amount of Posts of Each Type Per Week:</strong></h3>
<h3><span></span></h3>
<h3><span>• 3 feed posts per week (reels &amp; IGTV you choose to post to feed count here)</span></h3>
<h3><span>• 8-10 stories per week, preferably 2+ per day</span></h3>
<h3><span>• 4-7 reels per week</span></h3>
<h3>
<span>• 1-3 IGTV a week</span></h3>
<h3><strong>Rachel’s Far More Realistic Ideal Amounts Per Week For People Who Don’t Want to Go Insane:</strong></h3>
<h3><span>• 1-2 stories per day, preferably of your pets, so that i can see more pets (please show me your pets)</span></h3>
<h3><span>• 1 reel per week</span></h3>
<h3><span>• an IGTV if you’re feelin spicy?? i personally do not want to go through that kind of effort</span></h3>
<h3><span>• [REDACTED] amount of normal feed posts (check next section)</span></h3>

<h2><b>why things suck #3: consistency is key babeyyy</b></h2>

<p><span>Mr. Ig confirmed that the algorithm encourages posting more often. but some of us still have a small sliver of mental health that we wish to keep, so he gave me advice for us weaklings who are actually human. And that advice is to be </span><b>consistent over time.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Some examples he gave:</span></p>
<p>• posting on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday every week</p>
<p>• posting every other day</p>
<p>• posting 3 times per week</p>

<p><span>Publish your posts consistently at the same time (during your follower’s peak hours) over a long period of time. The algorithm likes consistency and patterns. breaking that pattern make it mad :(&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Following all of these instructions right away will not cause you to see instant success and growth. The key is to be consistent and persistent over time. and eventually. you’ll maybe get there :’)</span></p>
<br>
<h2><b>in conclusion: algorithm sucks but i hope this makes it a little less suck</b></h2>

<p><span>Please keep in mind that all of this is just Instagram’s Ideal™️, and Instagram does not care about your mental health and sanity!! But I do!! Please do not feel pressured like “oh god now i gotta come up with 7 reels a week just to get views on all my other posts otherwise i am subjected to instagram corporal punishment :(“ because seriously, the amount they want from people is inhumane. Take care of your own mental health and sanity first.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There are so many other things that factor into growing your Instagram audience, and this barely scratches the surface. I have many more&nbsp;articles about it that I still need to write, especially since numbers and the amount of content you churn out isn’t everything. So please remember that all of this is simply advice, not a bible to live by. be realistic and kind to yourself. or else. 🐸🔪</span></p>

					Imaging techniques enable a detailed look inside an organism. But interpreting the data is time-consuming and requires a great deal of experience. Artificial neural networks open up new possibilities: They require just seconds to interpret whole-body scans of mice and to segment and depict the organs in colors, instead of in various shades of gray. This facilitates the analysis considerably.

				</p></header><section><p>How big is the liver? Does it change if medication is taken? Is the kidney inflamed? Is there a tumor in the brain and did metastases already develop? In order to answer such questions, bioscientists and doctors to date had to screen and interpret a wealth of data.</p><p>"The analysis of three-dimensional imaging processes is very complicated," explains Oliver Schoppe. Together with an interdisciplinary research team, the TUM researcher has now developed self-learning algorithms to in future help analyze bioscientific image data.</p><p>At the core of the AIMOS software – the abbreviation stands for AI-based Mouse Organ Segmentation – are artificial neural networks that, like the human brain, are capable of learning. "You used to have to tell computer programs exactly what you wanted them to do," says Schoppe. "Neural networks don't need such instructions:" It's sufficient to train them by presenting a problem and a solution multiple times. Gradually, the algorithms start to recognize the relevant patterns and are able to find the right solutions themselves."</p><div id="c61471"><div><div><p>In the AIMOS project, the algorithms were trained with the help of images of mice. The objective was to assign the image points from the 3D whole-body scan to specific organs, such as stomach, kidneys, liver, spleen, or brain. Based on this assignment, the program can then show the exact position and shape.</p><p>"We were lucky enough to have access to several hundred image of mice from a different research project, all of which had already been interpreted by two biologists," recalls Schoppe. The team also had access to fluorescence microscopic 3D scans from the Institute for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at the Helmholtz Zentrum München.</p><p>Through a special technique, the researchers were able to completely remove the dye from mice that were already deceased. The transparent bodies could be imaged with a microscope step by step and layer for layer. The distances between the measuring points were only six micrometers – which is equivalent to the size of a cell. Biologists had also localized the organs in these datasets.</p></div></div></div><div id="c61472"><div><div><p>At the TranslaTUM the information techs presented the data to their new algorithms. And these learned faster than expected, Schoppe reports: "We only needed around ten whole-body scans before the software was able to successfully analyze the image data on its own – and within a matter of seconds. It takes a human hours to do this."</p><p>The team then checked the reliability of the artificial intelligence with the help of 200 further whole-body scans of mice. "The result shows that self-learning algorithms are not only faster at analyzing biological image data than humans, but also more accurate," sums up Professor Bjoern Menze, head of the Image-Based Biomedical Modeling group at TranslaTUM at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p>The intelligent software is to be used in the future in particular in basic research: "Images of mice are vital for, for example, investigating the effects of new medication before they are given to humans. Using self-learning algorithms to analyze image data in the future will save a lot of time in the future," emphasizes Menze.</p></div></div></div><div><h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span> Reading Time: </span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>Following successful trials in Ingolstadt, Audi is moving ahead with its smart networked traffic lights in Düsseldorf, which will become the second European city to be introduced to the German automaker’s Traffic Light Information service.</p><p>At the end of January, Audi drivers will see information from around 150 traffic lights in their cockpit, thus increasing their chance of catching a ‘green wave.’ By early summer most of the intersections in Düsseldorf, approximately 450 out of a total of some 600 installations, will be networked. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) services like Audi Traffic Light Information increase efficiency, convenience and safety on the roads.</p><p>Audi Traffic Light Information consists of two functions: Green Light Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA) and Time-to-Green. GLOSA calculates the ideal speed for getting a ‘green wave.’ For example, if the function indicates the applicable speed limit, the next traffic light will be reached at green. Drivers do not have to accelerate unnecessarily, they are not stressed, and they drive more safely. GLOSA can also suggest reducing speed gradually about 250 meters ahead of the traffic lights so that the driver and the cars behind reach the intersection when the lights turn to green. This reduces uneconomical stop-and-go traffic.</p><p>If stopping at a red light is unavoidable, a countdown displays the seconds remaining until the next green phase begins (Time-to-Green). Drivers can relax, take their foot off the gas pedal and save fuel. A number of studies conclude that drivers move through cities more efficiently thanks to networked traffic lights. In a pilot project, Audi was able to reduce fuel consumption by 15 percent.</p><p>“With Audi Traffic Light Information we wish to improve convenience for drivers, increase traffic safety and encourage an economical style of driving that looks ahead,” said Andre Hainzlmaier, head of development for Apps, Connected Services and Smart City at Audi.<br> “To do this, we have to predict precisely how traffic lights will behave in the next two minutes. At the same time, exact forecasts are the biggest challenge. Most signals react variably to traffic volume and continuously adapt the intervals at which they switch between red and green.”</p><p>In the future, cities will receive useful information about their traffic light infrastructure. The data show, for example, whether cars stop unusually often at a particular intersection or whether the average waiting time is comparatively long.</p><p>“We aggregate the recorded data into reports that we will make available to the city authorities. Traffic lights can then be given more efficient phasing and traffic will flow better,” adds Hainzlmaier.</p><p>Audi Traffic Light Information premiered in 2016 in Las Vegas. Today this V2I service is available at more than 10,000 intersections in North America, including some 2,000 in Manhattan/New York City and more than 1,600 around the US capital Washington D.C.

				<p>This post recounts the journey of writing
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent">cratetorrent</a>, interesting
optimizations, and some of the insights gained.</p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Growing up, torrenting was a big thing around me. I was always curious how it
worked.</p>
<p>This curiosity only grew after I had gotten into programming and understood more
details. There is a piece of technology that is so effective yet simple, that,
without any marketing, it gained widespread adoption due to sheer technical
superiority. It just worked and people used it.</p>
<p>So why not write one? I tried, in C++. It was never finished and it’s probably
better that way. Let’s forget it.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few years. I got into Rust and needed a familiar playground to
practice the language. I did what anyone in such a situation would do: I wrote
another torrent engine. It’s torrent engines all the way back.</p>
<p>Thus was cratetorrent born. The name is a wordplay on the C++
<a href="https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent"><code>libtorrent</code> library</a>. Its code and
blog were highly educational during my first attempt. This is my thanks.</p>
<h2 id="torrent-101">Torrent 101</h2>
<p>So how <em>do</em> torrents work?</p>
<p>A brief overview of the BitTorrent V1
protocol follows. For those familiar, feel free to skip to the <a href="#key-optimizations">next
section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>BitTorrent is a <em>mostly</em> decentralized file-sharing protocol: it consists of
potentially many symmetrical clients exchanging arbitrary data.</p>
<p>Its advantage over downloading from a single host is that the load is
distributed among all participants in the torrent, thereby increasing
availability, scalability, and often download speed, too.</p>
<p>It used to be highly popular, as everyone used it to share…Linux distros, yes,
and other <em>definitely legal content</em>. Nowadays it’s still in use, but its
use cases are more subtle: e.g. Windows 10 uses BitTorrent, or something like
it, to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/windows-10-uses-your-bandwidth-to-distribute-updates-d-1721091469">distribute
updates</a>
among its users.</p>
<h3 id="whos-in-a-torrent">Who’s in a torrent?</h3>
<p>The first actor on the stage is the torrent <em>metainfo</em> file. It contains basic
metadata about the torrent, most importantly its name, its files with their
paths and lengths, and its <em>trackers</em>. These files are usually hosted by
torrenting sites and this is what you download when starting a torrent.</p>
<p>So what are these trackers? While the download of the content itself is fully
decentralized, a client needs to know which other clients it can download from.
Such other clients in the torrent’s <em>swarm</em> are called <em>peers</em>. Peers that have
all the data are <em>seeds</em>, the rest are <em>leeches</em>. A bit of an uncomfortable
term.</p>
<p>Therefore at the beginning of a download a client asks trackers about
peers. Trackers are the only centralized part of the protocol.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Once done,
the client connects these peers and begins downloading data.</p>
<h3 id="data-representation">Data representation</h3>
<p>A torrent may have one or more files but from the point of view of the wire
protocol they are all just one big contiguous sequence of bytes.</p>
<p>This byte sequence is cut up into equal sized <em>pieces</em>, which are further cut up
into 16 KiB <em>blocks</em>. Peers exchange these blocks of data and use them to
reassemble the torrent’s files.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A peer can only share the complete pieces it has. However, breaking up a piece
into blocks enables downloading it from multiple peers, potentially
completing it sooner. Once complete, the peer can immediately share it with
other peers, even if it does not have all pieces itself. This increases
availability, a key feature of the protocol.</p>
<p>A tricky part here is that files are not padded to align with piece boundaries.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-data-repr.svg" alt="data representation">
</figure>



<p>This has two consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>the last piece may be smaller than the rest,</li>
<li>and pieces may not align with file boundaries, both shown above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore when writing blocks to disk, they may have to be split across several
files. The logic can get quite gnarly here if done optimally.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-peer-protocol">The peer protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the client connected the peer via TCP, they exchange handshakes.</li>
<li>One or both tells the other that it can start requesting blocks.</li>
<li>The client then requests a block from a piece it chose<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, its peer sends it,
and the client saves it.</li>
<li>Repeat until finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s about it, but perhaps surprising no one, a real world implementation will
be quite a bit more complex. Let’s see some of the complications.</p>
<h2 id="key-optimizations">Key optimizations</h2>
<p>(But nothing premature, promise!)</p>
<h3 id="download-pipelining">Download pipelining</h3>
<p>A naive implementation might do what was outlined above: send requests
sequentially, one after the previous request was served. The problem with it is
that it doesn’t utilize the connection’s capacity.</p>
<p>To do so, we try to estimate a connection’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">bandwidth-delay
product</a> for each peer
that the client is downloading from. This is the maximum amount of data that can
be on the link at any given time–that is, the sent but not yet received bytes.</p>
<p>So to get the best performance we keep as many requests outstanding as would
fill the link’s capacity.</p>
<p>A picture makes this explanation a lot more pleasant:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-request-pipeline.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>It’s clearly visible that in the same amount of time, a lot more requests could
be fulfilled. This is the number one most important optimization, strongly
recommended by the spec itself.</p>
<p>Cratetorrent uses a running average for the download rate and a simplified model
of the BDP, by assuming the latency to be a constant 1 second, to get the
request queue size:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> request_queue_size <span>=</span> download_rate <span>/</span> BLOCK_LEN;
</code></pre></div><p>The 1 second value was chosen for simplicity, but it’s a reasonable guess if we
take the link to mean the full request round-trip from one peer’s disk to that
of another.</p>
<h3 id="slow-start">Slow start</h3>
<p>The above suggests an interesting problem: what’s the fastest way of
arriving at the link’s capacity? Taking time to get to this optimum number costs
time. No good.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is a solved problem. To find the answer we just have
to peek one layer below in the network stack: <strong>TCP</strong>.</p>
<p>When a TCP connection is set up, the protocol tries to find the right congestion
window size. This is a fancy way of saying “the number of bytes to send that
doesn’t choke the remote host and everything else in between but still makes use
of the network capacity.” Our purposes are similar.</p>
<p>This is roughly what TCP does:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the start of the connection, set the congestion window size to some
constant.</li>
<li>Send an equivalent number of segments to peer.</li>
<li>For each ACK (acknowledgement message) received, increase the window size by
1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time all ACKs are received for a volley of segments, the window size
doubles. This growth is exponential, yet the algorithm is confusingly called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control#Slow_start">slow start</a>
(presumably named after the thing it tries to avoid).</p>
<p>TCP stops growing the window when the first timed out or dropped segment is
detected. This would be difficult to replicate in user-space, so cratetorrent
instead increases the request queue size every time a block is received, and
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent/blob/master/cratetorrent/src/peer/state.rs#L300-L316">stops</a>
when the download rate isn’t increasing much anymore.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-slow-start.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>With each served request, more requests are sent, and the connection is getting
closer to fully using the available bandwidth (the non-blue area is shrinking).</p>
<h3 id="endgame-mode">Endgame mode</h3>
<p>I noticed that sometimes the last phase of a download gets stagnant, barely
progressing from one block to the next.</p>
<p>This happens when the last pending pieces are downloaded from slow peers, which
can delay the completion of a download by a surprising amount.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, this issue is also solved–mentioned in the spec, in fact:</p>
<p>While normally each block is requested from a single peer, blocks in the last
pending pieces should be downloaded from all peers, on a “whoever sends it
first” basis. Once they arrive, requests to the slower peers are simply
cancelled. This wastes some bandwidth but saves quite a bit of time.</p>
<hr>
<p>These were the most significant design choices in terms of how they affected
performance. There are a few more but neither you or I have forever. So let’s
move on and see how all this translates into Rust.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Cratetorrent employs asynchronous IO on the network side, and a thread-pool
backed blocking IO on the disk side. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a> for both, the de facto async IO
runtime in Rust.</p>
<p>The engine’s main components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>engine</strong> itself, which manages torrents and executes the library user’s
commands.</li>
<li>One or more <strong>torrents</strong>, each corresponding to a single torrent
upload/download. They manage their peers and trackers.</li>
<li>Torrents have an arbitrary number of <strong>peer sessions</strong>, which represent
connections with peers from start to finish. This entity implements the
BitTorrent wire protocol and is as such on the lowest layer.</li>
<li><strong>Disk IO</strong> is handled by an entity of its own, for clarity and separation of
concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are separate <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.13/tokio/task">tasks</a>
(essentially application level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green
threads</a>). Because tasks are
as good as separate threads from the point of view of the borrow-checker, shared
access is not permitted without synchronization. There are two ways to do that.</p>
<h3 id="task-event-loop">Task event loop</h3>
<p>Control flow between tasks is primarily implemented via asynchronous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing"><em>message
passing</em></a>, using
multiple-producer single-consumer
<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels"><em>channels</em></a>. Each task is
reactive: it has an <em>event loop</em> and it reacts to internal events and messages
from other tasks.</p>
<p>Torrents and peer sessions perform a periodic “tick” (like the tick of a clock),
once a second currently, to update their internal state and broadcast messages.
This is when alerts (such as periodic download statistics or “download
complete”) are sent to the library user for example.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>A torrent’s event loop might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>loop</span> {
    select<span>!</span> {
        <span>// periodic tick
</span><span></span>        _ <span>=</span> tick_timer.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            self.tick().<span>await</span><span>?</span>;
        }
        <span>// peers wanting to connect
</span><span></span>        peer_conn_result <span>=</span> incoming.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> Ok(socket) <span>=</span> peer_conn_result {
                self.handle_incoming_peer(socket)<span>?</span>;
            }
        }
        <span>// commands from other parts of the engine
</span><span></span>        cmd <span>=</span> self.cmd_rx.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            self.handle_cmd(cmd).<span>await</span><span>?</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>(<code>select!</code> is a macro that waits on all streams and returns the item produced by
the first ready stream. And streams are just types that eventually produce a
<em>stream</em> of values over time.)</p>
<p>Another component in the engine might …</p></div></div>

Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I’ve applied to my own life.</p><h2 id="collaborative-thinking">Collaborative Thinking</h2><blockquote><p>Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft.</p></blockquote><p>It is no secret that the key to the rise of <em>Homo Sapiens</em> and the anthropocene wasn’t due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of <em>specialization of labour</em>.</p><p>As a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other’s knowledge of the world, our <em>collective</em> knowledge is much greater.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/knowledge.png" alt="Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge"><em>Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge</em></p><p>I like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique <em>subset</em> of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the <em>union of the knowledge</em> of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.</p><h2 id="knowledge-illusion">Knowledge illusion</h2><p>Humans also have this ‘knowledge illusion’ where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/zipper.png" alt="A crude illustration of a jacket zipper"><em>A crude illustration of a jacket zipper</em></p><p>An example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim “yes, of course!” Yet, if asked to describe in <em>detail</em> every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.</p><p>Although we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.</p><h2 id="rebalancing-our-blob-of-knowledge">Rebalancing our blob of knowledge</h2><p>Another interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are <em>magnetic</em>. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.</p><p>Individuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the <em>magnitude</em> of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.</p><blockquote><p>People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/spikes.png" alt="Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge"><em>Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge</em></p><p>What we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.</p><h2 id="learning-communities">Learning communities</h2><p>This, at least in part, is why I’ve recently become more certain of wanting to go to grad school in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I’ve started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it’s a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.</p><p>I’ve started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it’s been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I’m reading. I’ve found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own – a very different pace than the typical <em>code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat</em> self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.</p><p>The important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you’re studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.</p><h2 id="wiggle-room">Wiggle room</h2><blockquote><p>If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom</p></blockquote><p>For me, learning is very close to a zero-sum game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying ‘yes’ to any and every opportunity that comes up.</p><p>Slowly but surely, I’m learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I’m experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I’ll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>A big thank yu to <a href="https://twitter.com/ansonyuu">Anson</a> for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

December 29, 2020 | https://samkhawase.com/blog/javascript-is-english/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://samkhawase.com/blog/javascript-is-english/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>JavaScript is the undisputed king of the web and there is no competitor in sight<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. You can love it or hate it, but you can’t deny it’s indispensability when it comes to modern web. This despite the fact that JS lacks features present in languages like Haskell, Python, Swift etc. E.g. It supports neither <strong>static</strong> typing nor <strong>strong typing</strong> ala Haskell, a gap partially filled by TypeScript. It doesn’t have the first class support for <strong>multithreading</strong> like Java or Swift has, which WebWorkers are trying to fulfill. The quirks of JS and it’s ecosystem are the source of the infamous JS-fatigue<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but it’s popularity shows no sign of waning. When it comes to quirks, popularity, and standing, the only language it can be compared to is English.</p>
<p>Just like JavaScript rules the WorldWideWeb, English is the engine on which the globalized world runs. Notwithstanding it’s spread through brutal imperialism, it has truly become the foremost language for international discourse, law, science and technology. English has a quirky phonology and learners have to memorize cumbersome trivia in order to be proficient. It lacks the formalized grammar &amp; algebraic nature of <em>Sanskrit</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or the expressivity of <em>German</em>. But where English really shines is in it’s loose word order and ability to assimilate phonology and vocabulary from different languages. It freely borrowed from <em>Indo-European</em>, <em>Semitic</em>, <em>Dravidian</em>, <em>Turkic</em> languages and continues to form new innovative structures each year. English remains the only language with a spelling bee, and perhaps only language with a <em>word-of-the-year</em> ceremony.</p>
<p>So why did these languages became the front runners in their domains? The answer could lie in a cognitive heuristics that humans use to arrive at decisions, called <strong>Satisficing</strong>. Satisficing<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is the process of choosing a solution because it’s satisfactory, not because it will bring about perfect results. It’s a portmanteau of “satisfying” and “suffice”, coined by Herbert Simon who won Nobel prize in economics and best known for his theory of bounded rationality. The theory states that humans are more likely to make decisions based on time constraints and available information at hand. Satisficing is pragmatic and saves cost and time. JavaScript and English both are perfect examples of how satisficing led to their dominance. Were there better languages available? Yes, but the users love path of least resistance and stayed with JS/English. Both languages are omnipresent and easy to get started with; all it takes is a computer and a browser<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Both of them are extensible, people create new slang and a new JS framework with each passing day. Lastly they have an attractive culture attached to it. It literally pays to be use these 2 languages and both offer least resistance compared to the more “scientific” languages.</p>
<p>Both JavaScript and English have shown us that design-by-committee decisions aren’t organic, and humans tend favor pragmatic solutions that get them to the end goal fast. Are these the best languages to do the job? Probably not, and the internet is overflowing with memes about how crazy English and JS are. But they have definitely brought us all this far and keep chugging forward. After all ‘good enough’ is the enemy of ‘perfect’<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

        <h4>I learned that owning your data is powerful, and it's even more powerful when you are able to slice-and-dice it for better insights.</h4>
        <p>By Den Delimarsky in <a href="https://den.dev/categories/hackery">Hackery</a> </p>
        <p>December 28, 2020</p>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>I am naturally curious about the APIs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that the devices in my house use, so when I got an air quality monitor, one of the first things I did was fiddle with the REST APIs that were made available through the device. As it turns out - more than I expected. In this post, I will discuss the use of an undocumented API, so no warranties are implied - it might stop working tomorrow for all I know.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

<li><a href="#getting-data-through-app-apis">Getting data through app APIs</a></li>

<li><a href="#discovering-the-web-apis">Discovering the web APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Let’s get started by taking a look at <em>what</em> device I have, exactly. It’s an IQAir AirVisual Pro<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> - a bit on the pricey side, but it gets the job done and has all the data that I need, like CO2 concentration, current AQI<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, temperature, humidity, and PM2.5 concentration.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/air/airvisual-pro.png" alt="AirVisual Pro air quality monitor"></p>
<p>Neat little device, but the application that it comes with, along with the web experience is a bit underwhelming. Mostly because it only shows data for a short period of time, and doesn’t allow any kinds of pivots or transformations, which can be a bit boring. Say I want to know at what hours I have the highest CO2 concentration inside the house, or compare the humidity over time - none of this is an option with the default app <em>or</em> the online service.</p>
<p>If I wanted to go the easiest route, I could explore some of the built-in functionality. The device exposes a SMB share for the data that you can grab if you are on the local network, but that means that I need to boot device off of my guest network and onto my main one, which I don’t want to do. So what’s an engineer to do? Man-in-the-middle the app<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to figure out what servers it talks to, because I just <em>assumed</em> that the data is not only stored locally (there is a joke about Internet of Things here somewhere<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>).</p>
<h2 id="getting-data-through-app-apis">Getting data through app APIs</h2>
<p>The folks at IQAir seem to have created several branches for their API, and at least two are known to me - the one for the app, and the one for the web interface. By looking at the traffic that originated from my mobile device, I realized that there is an endpoint that can actually channel all the info in one call - all I needed to do was send requests to the following URL:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="http"><span>https://app-api.airvisual.com/api/v5/devices/{device_id}/measurements
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The device ID is something you can grab from the device itself or through the app.</p>
<p>Because with <code>mitmproxy</code> I can also inspect the headers, it was relatively easy to spot that there is a pre-baked <code>x-api-token</code> header that I could grab directly from the app. That is, if I just want to grab the data - but what if the token expires? Is there a way to get a new one? Well, as it turns out, the token is hard-coded into the application (or so it seems), which makes my job that much easier - this means I can just run all the requests I need directly. By using the aforementioned header, I am able to get a JSON representation of the data that originated from my device, along with the comparison information for the location I set the air quality sensor to use as the baseline.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/air/example-body-json.png" alt="Example of JSON payload returned by the IQAir API"></p>
<p>Great, so I am mostly where I want to be. I now can access the data, and ideally store it locally. By accessing the data directly from the service, I can now write a <code>cron</code> job that can take regular snapshots of the environment and place those somewhere. What is somewhere, though?</p>
<p>There could be many choices, including writing everything to a CSV file or maybe even to a document database, if I would need to access the information remotely. For now, however, I just needed to run local analysis, so I opted for SQLite. By using SQLite, I am able to create SQL queries on the data, and slice-and-dice it in a way that makes the most sense for scenarios that I care about right now, or might care about in the future. I could create a very simple table with the help of this SQL snippet:</p>

</div><p>I could already hear someone being utterly horrified by the fact that I chose the timestamp as the primary key, but worry not - this decision was made based on the fact that the environment data is captured on an hourly basis. What that means is that every entry should <em>technically</em> be unique, and if a new or updated entry is added with the same timestamp, it should just overwrite whatever is already in the database.</p>

<p>With the above, the data acquisition function should be referred to as the “parse a metric crapton of JSON” function that takes the data and places it inside an object:</p>

December 29, 2020 | https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/cmd-run-dev-null | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/cmd-run-dev-null">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            

<p>Goâ€™s <code>Cmd.Run</code> can fail in environments where <code>/dev/null</code> isnâ€™t present (or isnâ€™t accessible).</p>

<p>To explore this behaviour, letâ€™s start with a quick test program:</p>

<div>
  <pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"os"</span>
	<span>"os/exec"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>cmd</span> <span>:=</span> <span>exec</span><span>.</span><span>Command</span><span>(</span><span>"/usr/local/bin/docker-explorer"</span><span>,</span> <span>"echo"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hey"</span><span>)</span>

	<span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>cmd</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>()</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Error:"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
		<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Executed command"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This program runs the following command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>/usr/local/bin/docker-explorer <span>echo </span>hey
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer">docker-explorer</a> is an executable program that exposes the 
<code>echo</code> command. I have it locally installed at <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-explorer</code>.</p>

<p>Running this locally works fine, since <code>/dev/null</code> is available.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>go run main.go
Executed <span>command</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To simulate an environment where <code>/dev/null</code> isnâ€™t available, letâ€™s setup a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot jail</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Build the program to /tmp/test-program</span>
<span>$ CGO_ENABLED</span><span>=</span>0 go build <span>-o</span> /tmp/test-program main.go
<span># Create a directory to use as the chroot jail</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>chroot_jail
<span># Copy docker-explorer into the chroot jail</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> chroot_jail/usr/local/bin <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cp</span> /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer chroot_jail/usr/local/bin
<span># Copy the test program into the chroot jail directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>cp</span> /tmp/test-program chroot_jail/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The setup above might not work on macOS because of <a href="https://twitter.com/mycoliza/status/1275305517066227712">this change</a>.</p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s execute the test program within the chroot jail:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo chroot </span>chroot_jail /test-program
Error: open /dev/null: no such file or directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That fails citing that <code>/dev/null</code> isnâ€™t available.</p>

<p>Since our small Go program just executes <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-explorer</code>, letâ€™s try running that directly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo chroot </span>chroot_jail /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer <span>echo </span>hey
hey
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That <strong>didnâ€™t</strong> fail, so the <code>/dev/null</code> error definitely has something to do with our Go script, and not <code>docker-explorer</code> 
itself.</p>

<p>A look at <a href="https://golang.org/src/os/exec/exec.go?s=10413:10438#L327">the source</a> for 
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd.Run">Cmd.Run</a> reveals why <code>/dev/null</code> is used:</p>

<p><img src="https://rohitpaulk.com/images/articles/cmd-run-dev-null/exec-source.png" alt="os-exec-source"></p>

<p>Letâ€™s validate this by rewriting our program to use dummy values for Stdout, Stderr and Stdin, so that Go doesnâ€™t use <code>/dev/null</code>:</p>

<div>
  <pre><p><span>  <span>package</span> <span>main</span></span></p><p><span>  <span>import</span> <span>(</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>"fmt"</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>"os"</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>"os/exec"</span></span></p><p><span>  <span>)</span></span></p><p><span>+ <span>type</span> <span>nullReader</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span></span></p><p><span>+ <span>type</span> <span>nullWriter</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span></span></p><p><span>+ </span></p><p><span>+ <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>nullReader</span><span>)</span> <span>Read</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span> <span>}</span></span></p><p><span>+ <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>nullWriter</span><span>)</span> <span>Write</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span> <span>}</span></span></p><p><span>+ </span></p><p><span>  <span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>cmd</span> <span>:=</span> <span>exec</span><span>.</span><span>Command</span><span>(</span><span>"/usr/local/bin/docker-explorer"</span><span>,</span> <span>"echo"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hey"</span><span>)</span></span></p><p><span>+ 	<span>cmd</span><span>.</span><span>Stdin</span> <span>=</span> <span>nullReader</span><span>{}</span></span></p><p><span>+ 	<span>cmd</span><span>.</span><span>Stdout</span> <span>=</span> <span>nullWriter</span><span>{}</span></span></p><p><span>+ 	<span>cmd</span><span>.</span><span>Stderr</span> <span>=</span> <span>nullWriter</span><span>{}</span></span></p><p><span>+ </span></p><p><span>  	<span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>cmd</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>()</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span></span></p><p><span>  		<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Error:"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span></span></p><p><span>  		<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>Exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>}</span></span></p><p><span>  	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Executed command"</span><span>)</span></span></p><p><span>  <span>}</span></span></p></pre>
</div>

<p>When run with the new code, the program executes successfully:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ CGO_ENABLED</span><span>=</span>0 go build <span>-o</span> /tmp/test-program-2 /vagrant_data/main2.go 
<span>$ </span><span>cp</span> /tmp/test-program-2 chroot_jail/test-program-2
<span>$ </span><span>sudo chroot </span>chroot_jail /test-program-2
Executed <span>command</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: If either one of <code>Cmd.Stdout</code>, <code>Cmd.Stderr</code>, <code>Cmd.Stdin</code> are not explicitly set, Go sets them to <code>/dev/null</code>. This can
cause failures when using <code>Cmd.Run</code> in Go programs that execute in environments where <code>/dev/null</code> isnâ€™t accessible. To
fix this, either assign dummy values to <code>Cmd.Stdout</code>, <code>Cmd.Stderr</code> and <code>Cmd.Stdin</code>, or ensure that <code>/dev/null</code> is
accessible.</p>

<p>Note: I stumbled upon this behaviour when working on the 
<a href="https://codecrafters.io/challenges/docker">â€œBuild your own Dockerâ€�</a> challenge.</p>

   <h4><a name="sec1_Basic"></a>1.i "A basic time sharing system"</h4>

    The first documents, by Howard Sturgis, take up various aspects of a time-sharing
    system (including process scheduling, a disk-based file system, low-speed terminal i/o,
    and capabilities), but don't mention subprocesses and (multilevel) operations.
    <em>Was Howard working alone, or with Butler?</em>

    In the next series of documents, by Howard Sturgis, Butler Lampson, and Bruce
    Lindsay, Cal TSS begins to take shape: swapping controlled by a map, errors and
    interrupts, and more...

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="metaprogramming">


<p>One of the most intriguing things about R is its ability to do <strong>metaprogramming</strong>. This is the idea that code is data that can be inspected and modified programmatically. This is a powerful idea; one that deeply influences much R code. At the most basic level, it allows you to do things like write <code><a href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org/">library(purrr)</a></code> instead of <code><a href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org/">library("purrr")</a></code> and enable <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html">plot(x, sin(x))</a></code> to automatically label the axes with <code>x</code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Trig.html">sin(x)</a></code>. At a deeper level, it allows you to do things like use <code>y ~ x1 + x2</code> to represent a model that predicts the value of <code>y</code> from <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>, to translate <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/subset.html">subset(df, x == y)</a></code> into <code>df[df$x == df$y, , drop = FALSE]</code>, and to use <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">dplyr::filter(db, is.na(x))</a></code> to generate the SQL <code>WHERE x IS NULL</code> when <code>db</code> is a remote database table.</p>
<p>Closely related to metaprogramming is <strong>non-standard evaluation</strong>, NSE for short. This term, which is commonly used to describe the behaviour of R functions, is problematic in two ways. Firstly, NSE is actually a property of the argument (or arguments) of a function, so talking about NSE functions is a little sloppy. Secondly, it’s confusing to define something by what it’s not (standard), so in this book I’ll introduce more precise vocabulary.</p>
<p>Specifically, this book focuses on tidy evaluation (sometimes called tidy eval for short). Tidy evaluation is implemented in the rlang package,<span><a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="<p>Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham, <em>Rlang: Tools for Low-Level R Programming</em>, 2018, <a href=&quot;https://rlang.r-lib.org&quot; role=&quot;doc-biblioref&quot;>https://rlang.r-lib.org</a>.</p>"><sup>84</sup></a></span> and I’ll use rlang extensively in these chapters. This will allow you to focus on the big ideas, without being distracted by the quirks of implementation that arise from R’s history. After I introduce each big idea with rlang, I’ll then circle back to talk about how those ideas are expressed in base R. This approach may seem backward to some, but it’s like learning how to drive using an automatic transmission rather than a stick shift: it allows you to focus on the big picture before having to learn the details. This book focusses on the theoretical side of tidy evaluation, so you can fully understand how it works from the ground up. If you are looking for a more practical introduction, I recommend the tidy evaluation book at <a href="https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/">https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org</a><a tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="<p>As I write this chapter, the tidy evaluation book is still a work-in-progress, but by the time you read this it will hopefully be finished.</p>"><sup>85</sup></a>.</p>
<p>You’ll learn about metaprogramming and tidy evaluation in the following five chapters:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/meta-big-picture.html#meta-big-picture">17</a> gives a high level description of the whole
metaprogramming story, briefly learning about all major components
and how they fit together to form a cohesive whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html#expressions">18</a> shows that that all R code can be described as a
tree. You’ll learn how to visualise these trees, how the rules of R’s
grammar convert linear sequences of characters into these trees, and how to
use recursive functions to work with code trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html#quasiquotation">19</a> presents tools from rlang that you can use to
capture (quote) unevaluated function arguments. You’ll also learn about
quasiquotation, which provides a set of techniques to unquote input to make
it possible to easily generate new trees from code fragments.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/evaluation.html#evaluation">20</a> moves on to evaluating captured code. Here you’ll
learn about an important data structure, the <strong>quosure</strong>, which ensures
correct evaluation by capturing both the code to evaluate, and the
environment in which to evaluate it. This chapter will show you how to put
all the pieces together to understand how NSE works in base R, and how to
write functions that work like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/subset.html">subset()</a></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/translation.html#translation">21</a> finishes up by combining first-class environments, lexical
scoping, and metaprogramming to translate R code into other languages,
namely HTML and LaTeX.</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><span>As the CFO of </span><a href="https://yipitdata.com/"><span>YipitData</span></a><span>, Eric Lesser has to have a quarterback-like vision on his company's</span></em><em><span> financial health.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Eric manages the finance and accounting teams to help the company financially strategize for all ongoing and new initiatives. His work cuts across the organization's different teams and is the linchpin to maintaining Yipit’s explosive growth.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Prior to joining YipitData, Eric was the VP of FP&amp;A and Corporate Development at Payoneer. There he helped lead </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/payoneer-raises-180-million-for-its-global-payments-technology/"><span>several venture</span></a><span> </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140305005995/en/Payoneer-Secures-25-Million-Funding-Led-Investor"><span>rounds</span></a><span> as part of the internal Corporate Development team. Having joined Payoneer in mid-2012, Eric watched the company transform from a relatively successful early stage venture to a global player in the payments space.</span></em></p>

<h5><b>Give me the FP&amp;A 101 for startups - What does it mean? What are the work products of someone in FP&amp;A? What are some different calculations or metrics typically used?</b></h5>
<p><span>FP&amp;A’s main goal is to provide insights to help business managers make informed decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>What does this mean in practice? While each FP&amp;A team will have different responsibilities, there are more standard FP&amp;A work products, and ad-hoc analysis that will depend on the company and change as the company scales.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the more standard work products can include forecast models, budgets, board reporting, unit economics and KPI monitoring, and other ad-hoc analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To dive a little deeper into a standard work product, FP&amp;A is typically responsible for creating a multi-year forecast for the company.&nbsp; In order to do this the FP&amp;A team needs to understand the drivers of the business’s revenue and determine what revenue can realistically look like a few years out and the resources needed to get there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an example, FP&amp;A might first look at the business and come up with a reasonable assumption of how much it will grow based on historical trends.&nbsp; From there maybe you layer on how much new sales the business will do based on the productivity of the sales team.&nbsp; If you want to grow, you might add more salespeople, but then FP&amp;A will need to understand how those new people increase costs – for example, you might need more office space, or maybe you need more people in HR to recruit them, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>So, it’s really about seeing the entire picture and coming up with a coherent logical story for what the future might look like.</span></p>

<p><b>When should startups begin thinking about implementing an FP&amp;A process? What initial steps do you recommend a growing startup take to make sure they stay financially healthy?</b></p>
<p><span>Businesses would benefit from having a more structured FP&amp;A process once they are in a stage where they need to allocate financial resources and prioritize among different investment decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>When a startup is early, and just trying to build and market a single product, it’s a bit simpler; you need to budget your cash, of course, but you aren’t deciding between multiple competing different investment opportunities that you need to evaluate separately.&nbsp; Then you might reach a phase where you are growing super quickly and don’t really have time or a need to think about FP&amp;A.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>But once you are in a place where you could either invest in sales, product team or marketing it becomes worthwhile to add some more structure since you will need to figure out which is the best investment and what you can afford. At its best, FP&amp;A helps the business understand the trade-offs of investing in one area versus another. On top of that, FP&amp;A will be able to show you, with some reasonable accuracy, how much revenue the business will be needed to pay for those investments. Then, as a result, how much cash will be generated or, more likely for a startup, how much additional cash you will need to support the business.</span></p>

<p><b>Modeling can be a bit of an art - what factors go into your modeling process at Yipit?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>I definitely agree with that statement.&nbsp; We are certainly doing a lot of analysis for our models and are being as scientific as possible, but at the end of the day when modeling you are basically trying to predict the future and there are a lot of unknowns.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At YipitData and at Payoneer, our modeling process was somewhat similar in the sense that we differentiated between our existing products versus new opportunities. The existing business is much more predictable; we take a few different approaches but one way that we have seen some success in the past is by looking at the trends on a cohort basis and using that as a way to determine what the next few years might look like.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, we might look at products we launched in 2018 and see how those products scaled up in 2019 and 2020 and compare that to 2019 new products launched and the performance in 2020.&nbsp; From there you can potentially identify some patterns that will help you determine what a realistic number in the future might be depending on a range of factors.</span></p>

<p><b>How is this different for new products vs existing products?</b></p>
<p><span>For new products, you don’t have these historical trends to analyze, and that’s when it can become much more of an art.&nbsp; So there are a few different approaches here: you might try to figure out a similar product that was launched before and expect a similar result, or you might do more of a top-down market sizing analysis where you estimate how big the potential is and come up with a reasonable number for how many customers you can acquire over time.</span></p>
<p><span>For both existing and especially new products analysis is the key to putting a strong model together, but at the same time an effective FP&amp;A team really needs to understand all aspects of the business.&nbsp; So, you’d want to work with product and sales teams to understand if the assumptions you are using are reasonable, and if not, why not.</span></p>
<p><span>And once you have the model built, it’s really important to track actual results versus expectations so that you can learn about how to adjust in the future.</span></p>

<p><b>Who are the stakeholders when it comes to FP&amp;A at Yipit? As CFO, what is your process for dealing with everyone and making sure everyone is aligned?</b></p>
<p><span>The FP&amp;A team is really only as good as the inputs we are getting from other parts of the business.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the numbers and financial analysis are very important, but numbers will only tell you part of the story when trying to understand prior performance and what it means for the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>In order for FP&amp;A to be effective, you really need to understand the business, which comes from building relationships with others outside of finance. That should really include all departments, such as sales, marketing, product/technology, operations, HR, etc.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>The tricky thing here is that managers of these departments are usually very busy running their respective areas of the business, and it’s a meeting with FP&amp;A can be seen as unnecessary bureaucracy that slows things down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to combat this, I’ve found it’s really useful to not only use these meetings as a way for FP&amp;A better understand their areas of the business but also to demonstrate the value of what FP&amp;A can bring.</span></p>
<p><span>A few ways to do this include proactively sharing analysis that can be insightful and interesting to them, explaining why the information is needed and how we are positioning the company to the Board, and finally and most importantly really positioning the FP&amp;A/manager relationship as a partnership that will help us justify investment in whatever they want to achieve.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This doesn’t happen on Day 1 and takes time, but it can be tremendously helpful in getting the alignment needed.&nbsp; It requires an FP&amp;A team that is not only good at number crunching but at explaining numbers on a high level to people who are not used to seeing them every day.</span></p>

<p><b>What other types of finance or accounting processes are in place for a team the size of Yipit (team wide, individual) and what is the cadence of reviewing these?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>We will end the year with just over 170 employees, up from 115 earlier this year.&nbsp; We’ve been fortunate to grow despite the difficult circumstances that everyone faced this year with COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of our major processes include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Budget – this kicks off in September and finishes toward the end of the year.&nbsp; It involves first getting a sense internally of where the business is likely to end up from a revenue / cash flow point of view, and then deep discussions with each manager to determine what are some of the new initiatives we will want to focus on in the next year and projecting how much they will cost and the potential return on investment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Budget versus actual analysis – the next step once the budget is approved is to share a file with each manager on a monthly basis to demonstrate what their expenses were versus the budget. This gives them clear insight into how things are tracking.&nbsp; I tell the managers that while we do want to monitor expenses, the best thing that could happen is if we find some sort of investment that is working really well, and we want to increase the budget for that expense. This is a great opportunity for us to better understand what is happening in each department and what they are focused on and why.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Board of Directors presentation – our Board of Directors has monthly calls and quarterly meetings, for which the FP&amp;A team is responsible for putting together analysis charts and KPIs to demonstrate how the business is doing relative to expectations and why.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Monthly financial close – we report our financials on a monthly basis and each month kicks off a 10 day in depth process to close our books and report accurately</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Monthly meetings with teams – The FP&amp;A team meets with other teams outside of the budget process on a monthly basis to both share analysis and learn about what is happening in other areas of the business.&nbsp; The more we can understand the business the better we are able to analyze and forecast</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span> </span><span>Distribution of a KPI dashboard – this is a process we are just starting now on a monthly basis but at Payoneer it was more frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

This component enables Apple to carry over many popular iOS features which require extra hardware security like Touch ID and Apple Pay to the Mac.</p><p id="4f7b">One of the lesser-known features of the Secure Enclave is that it performs automatic hardware based encryption of a Mac’s built-in SSD. This means that without any user intervention, your new Mac is encrypted right out of the packaging. With this fact in mind, you may be wondering if taking the extra step of enabling FileVault is still necessary? I am here to tell you, <strong>yes, it is absolutely </strong>necessary<strong>.</strong></p><p id="c7b9">An encrypted Mac without FileVault allows anyone who has physical access to your device to trivially read your personal data. They don’t even need to know your password. Even worse, some tools used to detect FileVault’s status (like <a href="http://osquery.io/" rel="noopener">osquery</a>), can conflate the differences between <strong>Encrypted</strong> versus <strong>FileVault On</strong> causing you to believe the data on your Mac is safe, when in fact, it’s unprotected from the most common scenarios wherein we rely on encryption to save us.</p><p id="6c62">In this article we will review the current situation, the steps you should take to ensure you are correctly polling this information, and how we are patching osquery to resolve this confusion.</p><ul><li id="5e11">The osquery <code>disk_encryption</code> table as of December 20th, 2020, reports a value of <code>encrypted = 1</code> for <strong>all T2 and M1 Macs</strong>, <em>regardless of the FileVault status</em>.

With this new Secure Enclave CPU, Apple moved from a pattern of software encryption (FileVault2) to automatic hardware encryption. In 2020, on the newly introduced Apple Silicon Macs, a similar Secure Enclave is built right into the M1 SoC.</p><p id="24db">Both the T2 and the M1 Secure Enclave securely store a 256-bit AES key (UID) which cannot be directly accessed and is burnt into the chip, protecting both the SSD’s data and the TouchID sensor’s stored fingerprints, as well as disabling the device’s camera and microphone when the computer is locked.</p><p id="fe41">What this means in practice, is that the data on a Mac’s disk cannot be accessed once the disk is physically separated from the Mac or if the underlying encryption key is lost. In fact, if your Secure Enclave is damaged or wiped, this encryption will prevent you from accessing any of the contents of the drive. This is yet another failure mode one must negate with backups (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/mac-help/mh11421/11.0/mac/11.0" rel="noopener">which come with their own encryption considerations</a>)</p><p id="74e6">Before the introduction of the T2 security chip, disk encryption was synonymous with FileVault configuration on macOS. However, with hardware encryption this distinction became multi-faceted. This nuance was particularly problematic for security agents that did not differentiate between a disk that was ‘encrypted’ and a device that had FileVault configured.</p><p id="b412">Unfortunately, osquery fell into that camp, and its <code>disk_encryption</code> table simply returned a boolean value for the column <code>encrypted</code>, leading many to draw an erroneous conclusion causing a false sense of security.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1" width="1600" height="1029" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Osquery conflates the differences between FileVault and Encryption in its `disk_encryption` virtual table leading to False Negatives</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8637">This issue was discovered when the output of common macOS terminal utilities (<code>diskutil apfs list</code> and <code>fdesetup status</code>) returned different information from what was observed when querying devices using osquery.</p><p id="c10b">This issue proved initially difficult to track down, due to the false-negative nature. It is often easier to track down a coding issue producing a false-positive but an intermittent false negative can be truly maddening. Because users are encouraged during setup to configure FileVault on new devices it is uncommon to see devices without it, this coupled with the fact that the table worked as expected on older hardware, led to a difficulty in establishing a pattern and subsequently a lag-time in discovery.</p><p id="1e06">Fortunately with some additional reverse engineering of Kolide <a href="https://github.com/kolide/launcher/pull/686" rel="noopener">updated its own agent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6823" rel="noopener">Osquery itself</a> to report this data accurately. At the time of this writing the Osquery core-team has not issued an official release containing this fix, but building the agent yourself should net the new column you need.</p><p id="d7e3">Since publishing this article, I have gotten some feedback suggesting I am making a mountain out of a molehill.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_e59"><div><p>Curiosity is the reason why most of the breakthrough discoveries and remarkable inventions have happened throughout history. In the absence of curiosity, there would not have been an impulse to seek new information or experiences. Exploring possibilities is what defines human nature and thus curiosity is an integral part of us. But as we grow older, we become more passive and start limiting ourselves to newer ideas. Thus, we need to cultivate a process and this post talks about how to develop curiosity and make the most out of it.</p><h2>Benefits of curiosity</h2><p>Before diving into the steps for how to develop curiosity, let us first look at why we need curiosity in the first place. The benefits include:</p><ul><li><strong>Innovation:</strong> An active mind is always looking for answers and brings newer ideas to the table</li><li><strong>Fewer decision-making errors:</strong> Since a curious person has done some research, they are likely to make lesser errors, and are also less likely to fall prey to confirmation bias.</li><li><strong>More communication among teams:</strong> Curious people tend to discuss a lot. This increases the performance of teams since there are more open discussions and people listen carefully to one another. It can also lead to reduced group conflicts.</li></ul><h2>How to develop curiosity?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Now that we understand the benefits of curiosity, let’s look at steps that you can take to develop it.</p><h2>1. Keep an open mind</h2><p>We often assume that we know how everything works and that we have seen it all. That attitude is the biggest killer of curiosity and is the first step in developing curiosity. Pretending that we are children and not associating past experiences can help in grasping a better understanding of things.</p><p>We should not rely on assumptions and be prepared to learn, unlearn, and relearn.</p><p>We should also be prepared to accept the possibility that the things that we already know might be incorrect. Trying to look at things without as much bias as possible helps improve our decision-making capabilities. Bias also leads us to categorizing things as “boring” which is a curiosity killer.</p><h2>2. Question everything relentlessly</h2><p>Life is full of questions that we do not know the answers to. Notice things and asking questions around them and their existence brings in an element of fascination and inquisition. Instead of taking things for granted, we should dig deeper to have a better idea of what is beneath the surface.</p><p>The best questions are open-ended ones. Try and ask more of “Why?”, “What if…?” and “How might we…?” questions. Also, be willing to ask dumb questions. Most of the time we assume that the question is dumb, even though it might not be. And even if ends up being one, it can still lead to an interesting conversation.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with not knowing everything. But not asking the question is probably a bad decision.</p><p>Do you know why the sky is blue? Why the water is wet? How is electricity transmitted? Why the earth is round? Why is the fire hot? What causes the seasonality around the year? Why is red the most eye-catching color? What if you could stop time whenever you wanted to? How might we get an answer to all these questions?</p><p>What can I learn from this? is a question that brings in a perspective that we might not have thought of otherwise. This is one question that can drastically increase our curiosity if we ask it of ourselves after doing something. It can also help prepare us for unexpected outcomes of an event.</p><h2>3. Diversify your interests</h2><p>We often romanticize curiosity in children and always use the phrase “They have not been tainted by life’s experiences yet”. But creativity is not cultivated in a void.</p><p>Successful innovators are usually ones who are able to amass vast amounts of knowledge, often in various fields. They are then able to draw on this knowledge unthinkably. Once they have that mastery, they focus on rewriting their domains, mixing and remixing thoughts, ideas, and themes. Since they have knowledge about different domains, they are able to easily make analogies and spot patterns leading to creative breakthroughs.</p><p>There are many names given to this process. Here’s Elon Musk explaining first principles:</p><figure><p> <iframe title="The First Principles Method Explained by Elon Musk" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV3sBlRgzTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>We should therefore become experts who are interested in everything. It is good to be a master of a few things, but breadth is important too. To really ignite knowledge, we need to have the thought process of being able to reason from different perspectives and also being able to collaborate with people with different specializations.</p><p>If listening to music is your favorite hobby, try switching to reading a book. Go out and explore the world, from your neighborhood to a new city. Watch a documentary if you have never watched one, or maybe a foreign movie. New experiences help activate our minds in ways other things cannot. And active minds are the best answer to “how to develop curiosity?”</p><h2>4. Find solace in discomfort</h2><p>Trying something new can be scary. But we have to become comfortable in that discomfort in order to embrace curiosity. Staying in our comfort zone is easy. But it kills our curiosity and runs our creative juices dry. The more curious we become, the less afraid we are to try newer things. And the better understanding we have of things around us. If we are afraid of doing something, we should focus on its positive outcomes.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Go out and try something new, and ask questions around it, and be amazed by every day things! And leave a comment below about what you find.</p><p><em>“I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.”</em> – Albert Einstein</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 29, 2020 | https://saasitive.com/tutorial/django-rest-framework-reset-password/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://saasitive.com/tutorial/django-rest-framework-reset-password/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>What to do when user forgot the password? We need to have a <strong>reset password view</strong>. User enters there her email address and email with reset link is sent. The reset link contains special information like <code>uid</code> and <code>token</code>. When user clicks the reset link, the <strong>reset password confirm view</strong> is displayed. This view takes the <code>uid</code> and <code>token</code> from the link and a new password and send <code>POST</code> request to the Django server to set a new password. In this post, we will create the reset password functionality with Django Rest Framework and Djoser package.</p>

<p>What will you learn in this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how does reset password work in the web service,</li>
  <li>how to send reset password email,</li>
  <li>how to set a new password with reset link,</li>
  <li>how to <strong>test</strong> the above functionality.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user interface and production email setup will be descibed in the next posts (in this post only backend code will be provided). Fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/rgAG9gkhUEH2wUVt5">form</a> to be notified about future posts.</p>

<p>This article is a part of articles series on <a href="https://saasitive.com/django-react/boilerplate/">how to build SaaS from scratch with Django and React</a>. I will use the code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/django-rest-framework-reset-password/">Django Rest Framework Email Verification</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reset-password-flow">Reset Password Flow</h2>

<p>In the backend there are two endpoints for reset password functionality. Both endpoints are provided by the <a href="https://djoser.readthedocs.io/">Djoser</a> package:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_endpoints.html#reset-password">Reset Password</a> endpoint, that is available at <code>/users/reset_password/</code> URL. The enpoint requires the <code>email</code> field to send an email with reset password link. It has variable <code>PASSWORD_RESET_SHOW_EMAIL_NOT_FOUND</code> in the settings, by default set to <code>False</code>. It controls what type of error returns in the case of <code>email</code> address in the request which doesn’t exist in the database - by default it will return <code>HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT</code> and doesn’t send any email. If you want different behaviour, just change this variable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_endpoints.html#reset-password-confirmation">Reset Password Confirmation</a> endpoint, that is available at <code>/users/reset_password_confirm/</code>. We need to send in <code>POST</code> request the <code>uid</code> and <code>token</code> from reset link to this endpoint. We also need to send a new password provided by user. If all goes well, this endpoint will return <code>HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reset password functionality flow is presented below:</p>

<p><img src="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/django-rest-framework-reset-password/reset_password_flow.png" alt="Reset Password Flow"></p>

<p>To enable reset password functionality we need to configure <code>Djoser</code> in <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code> file. We need to set <code>PASSWORD_RESET_CONFIRM_URL</code> variable that points to the URL address in the frontend with reset password confirm view.</p>

<p>The example of reset password email:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Subject</span><span>:</span><span> Password reset on SaaSitive</span>

Body:

You're receiving this email because you requested a password reset for your user account at SaaSitive.

Please go to the following page and choose a new password:
http://testserver/reset_password/MQ/afnd93-8d1799decda7137bbf57c047ed33ee86
Your username, in case you've forgotten: test_user

Thanks for using our site!

The SaaSitive team
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The link to reset the password:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>http://testserver/reset_password/MQ/afnd93-8d1799decda7137bbf57c047ed33ee86
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From our reset link:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>uid = MQ</code>,</li>
  <li><code>token = afnd93-8d1799decda7137bbf57c047ed33ee86</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry that the reset link has <code>http://testserver</code> - it is only for testing purposes. It will be set to the correct domain address in production.</p>

<h2 id="test-reset-password-functionality">Test reset password functionality</h2>

<p>We are ready to write tests for reset password functionality. We will write three tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>test for normal flow, the registered user with active account request the password reset,</li>
  <li>test for reset password of inactive user (email not verified),</li>
  <li>test for reset password with not existing email address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s add tests in <code>backend/server/apps/accounts/tests.py</code> file. Please add a new class <code>PasswordResetTest</code> (above the <code>EmailVerificationTest</code> class from the <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/django-rest-framework-email-verification">previous post</a>).</p>

  <li>request email with reset password link,</li>
  <li>parse reset password email,</li>
  <li>confirm reset password with <code>uid</code>, <code>token</code> and <code>new_password</code>,</li>
  <li>try to login with old password (fails with <code>HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST</code>),</li>
  <li>try to login with new password (success with <code>HTTP_200_OK</code>).</li>

<h2 id="commit-changes-to-the-repository">Commit changes to the repository</h2>

<p>That’s all. We have reset password functionality ready and tested. We need to commit changes to the repository:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git commit <span>-am</span> <span>"reset password in the backend"</span>
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We configured <code>Djoser</code> for reset password functionality (by setting one variable!).</li>
  <li>We have two endpoints: <strong>reset password</strong> for sending email with reset link and <strong>reset password confirm</strong> to set a new password.</li>
  <li>New functionality was tested with unit tests.</li>
  <li>We will write user interface in React for this functionality in the next post.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code for this tutorial is available at <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate">Github repository</a>.</p>

December 29, 2020 | https://mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<!-- End header -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof"><em>Futureproof</em></a> is a live editor for GPU shaders,
built on Zig, Neovim, and WebGPU.</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/marble.png" alt="Marble shader"><br>
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtX3Ws">(original shader by S. Guillitte)</a></p>
<p>It's designed for a quick feedback loop,
recompiling shaders and marking errors live!</p>
<p>The name is tongue-in-cheek,
because it builds on as many unproven new technologies as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which is a "better C"</li>
<li>The editor is an embedded <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, which is a modernized Vim</li>
<li>Graphics are done with <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/">WebGPU</a>,
which is an in-development next-gen API</li>
</ul>
<p>The system also uses
<a href="https://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a> for font rasterization
and <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> for windowing,
but those are both relatively mature,
so I don't get any points for them.</p>
<h2>Embedding Neovim</h2>
<p>Neovim is run as a subprocess (<code>nvim --embed</code>),
which communicates on <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>
using the <a href="https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc"><code>msgpack-rpc</code></a> format.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/msgpack.zig"><code>msgpack</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/rpc.zig"><code>msgpack-rpc</code></a>
libraries in Zig from the ground up,
which ended up being &lt; 1 KLOC.</p>
<p>A listener thread monitors the subprocess's <code>stdout</code>,
decoding messages then passing events and responses into a pair of queues.
The main loop claims and handles events before drawing each frame.</p>
<p>RPC calls are blocking: the call is encoded and passed to the subprocess's
<code>stdin</code>, then we wait for the listener thread to return the response
on the queue.</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/nvim.svg" alt="Neovim"></p>
<h2>Drawing the character grid</h2>
<p>Neovim's abstract UI model is a monospaced grid of a particular width and height.
Each cell in the grid has a character and attribute ID;
the latter is a lookup into a table of colors, bold, underlines, etc.</p>
<p>The grid and attribute table are modified through API messages
(<code>grid_line</code>, <code>grid_cursor_goto</code>, <code>hl_attr_define</code>, <code>mode_change</code>, etc),
so our UI has to keep track of this state.</p>
<p>These API calls are evaluated by the main loop
and edit state in CPU memory,
but we want rendering to be done by the GPU.
As it turns out,
both Zig and GLSL can import C headers, so Futureproof uses a fun trick:
we define a set of <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/extern/futureproof.h">C <code>structs</code></a>,
populate them on the CPU (in Zig),
then copy them to the GPU and use them directly (in GLSL).</p>
<p>(This requires a <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/ext/GL_EXT_scalar_block_layout.txt">GLSL extension</a>
to properly pack the <code>structs</code>)</p>
<p>We split the state into two pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta-data tables (attributes, font atlas, etc.) are in a <strong>uniform buffer</strong>,
as they're relatively small (11 KB in total)</li>
<li>The character grid is larger (1 MB), and so is passed as a <strong>storage buffer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The font is rasterized and packed into a texture on the CPU side.
As part of the meta-data, we include the positions and bounding boxes
of each character.
The font ends up looking something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/font.png" alt="Font texture"></p>
<p>The grid stores character and attribute indices packed into a <code>uint32_t</code> per cell.
This limits us to 65535 characters, but that's acceptable.</p>
<p>In this architecture, the CPU side doesn't think about vertex positions at all!
It simply passes the character grid to a vertex shader and tells it to draw
<code>total_tiles * 6</code> elements.</p>
<p>The vertex shader then calculates vertex positions,
lays out tiles in the character grid,
samples from the font texture, and so on.</p>
<p>Getting pixel-perfect font rendering was a comedy of (off-by-one) errors,
including this particularly cursed GUI:</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/haunted.png" alt="Haunted Neovim GUI"></p>
<h2>Platform integration</h2>
<p>I developed Futureproof on macOS,
and there were a few cases where I needed to hook into native APIs.</p>
<p>The <code>wgpu-native</code> demo simply <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/blob/master/examples/triangle/main.c#L58-L66">writes Objective-C in <code>main.c</code></a>,
then <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/blob/master/examples/triangle/CMakeLists.txt#L16">compiles with <code>-x objective-c</code></a>,
meaning the input source file is secretly Objective-C, rather than plain C.</p>
<p>This doesn't quite work with Zig, despite my best efforts:
the pass-through C compiler doesn't accept the <code>-x</code> flag.
Instead, we can use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Objective-C Runtime API</a> directly,
inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jimon/osx_app_in_plain_c">OS X app in Plain C</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, this is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/objc.zig">surprisingly clean</a>:
We're not defining our own classes, so we just use
<code>sel_getUid</code>, <code>objc_lookUpClass</code>, and <code>objc_msgSend</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/paste.zig#L9-L18">Here's how we use it</a>
to get a string from the pasteboard.</p>
<p>(Of course, this is fundamentally terrifying and shouldn't be used for production code)</p>
<h2>Live shader previews</h2>
<p>Futureproof attaches itself to the Neovim buffer,
so it receives messages whenever the buffer changes.
This lets us keep a mirror of the text on the Futureproof side of the RPC barrier.</p>
<p>If the text hasn't changed in some amount of time (200 ms by default),
we pass it to <code>shaderc</code> and attempt to compile it from GLSL to SPIR-V.
Errors are parsed out of the return value and passed back into Neovim,
showing up in the location list and as signs in the left column.</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/error.png" alt="Error"></p>
<p>After a shader is successfully compiled, the SPIR-V bytecode is passed into WebGPU
and rendered with the rest of the GUI.</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge was keeping the GUI performant while
rendering a shader in the same GPU queue.
For challenging shaders like <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1">this seascape</a>,
the shader takes hundreds of milliseconds to render.</p>
<p><img src="https://mattkeeter.com/projects/seascape.png" alt="Seascape"></p>
<p>There's got to be a <em>good</em> way to handle this,
but for Futureproof, I used a hack:
when a shader takes too long,
the preview image is split into tiles, each of which updates once per GUI frame.
The tiles are stored in a separate texture,
which is copied into the main texture once all tiles have been rendered.</p>
<p>This effectively slows down the shader by a factor of <code>n^2</code>,
where <code>n</code> is the number of tiles per side.
We pick <code>n</code> to keep the GUI responsive,
with a median filter to stop single slow frames from messing things up.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear the <em>correct</em> way to handle this with WebGPU,
but suspect that it will require support for multiple queues,
which isn't yet in the standard.</p>
<h2>Are these technologies ready for use?</h2>
<h3>Neovim</h3>
<p>Yes, it's relatively stable.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13418">one bug</a>
early in development,
which received no feedback, so that's a minor red flag.</p>
<p>More recently, I discovered a
<a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13626">more serious issue</a>
which makes it easy to deadlock Futureproof.
This more concerning,
but it may be a problem with how I architected the GUI and live error-marking system;
I'm waiting to hear back from the Neovim development team about this issue.</p>
<h3>Zig</h3>
<p>Absolutely not!
This is to be expected:
it's at 0.7.0, so it's not <em>supposed</em> to be stable or bug-free.</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amkeeter">multiple bugs</a>,
and understanding the standard library requires reading the source.</p>
<p>In addition, it's changing very quickly;
updating to the latest nightly build breaks Futureproof regularly.</p>
<p>Still, Zig is <strong>fun</strong>!</p>
<p>Things that I particularly like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general-purpose allocator, which can print memory leaks on program exit.
This is like running in Valgrind all the time, and makes writing
leak-free code part of normal development.</li>
<li>C library interop is fantastic: you can natively import header files, then
call into C libraries, and it all just works!</li>
<li>The philosophy of passing explicit allocators around; particularly how arena
allocators can then be used for easy memory management.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to like <code>comptime</code> evaluation,
but it's a little too shaky right now:
I tried to use it for a
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/msgpack.zig#L119-L183">generic <code>msgpack</code> struct packer</a>,
and often ended up confused whether my code was wrong or the compiler was broken.</p>
<p>More generally, I fear that <code>comptime</code> is <em>too powerful</em>:
without some kind of concept or trait system, it can be a free-for-all.
For example, using <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Generic-Data-Structures"><code>comptime</code> type variables to do generics</a>
is <em>extremely clever</em>,
but it means that generating documentation will be a challenge:
after all, it's powerful enough to return entirely different APIs
depending on the type!</p>
<p>(Of course, this is also true for C++ templates, but they're hard enough to use that
most people don't get too weird with them)</p>
<p>Similarly, error handling is a little rough:
there's no way to attach data (e.g. a message) to an error
while using the language-level error handling.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm a little iffy on the
"strings are simply arrays of <code>u8</code>" philosophy.
Though static strings are guaranteed to be UTF-8,
the onus is on the programmer
(rather than the type system)
to enforce that strings from other sources be correctly encoded.
For a detailed look at where this can break,
see the discussion of <code>std::fs::metadata</code> in
<a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">this post</a></p>
<p>(the previous paragraph has been edited after publication,
based on feedback from the Zig Discord)</p>
<h3>WebGPU</h3>
<p>WebGPU is <em>fine</em>, but the documentation is lacking.
I had to reverse-engineer a lot of behavior from examples,
reading the source code,
and pre-existing knowledge of modern graphics APIs.
As discussed above,
the lack of multi-queue rendering was the only real frustration.</p>
<p>I was using the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native"><code>wgpu-native</code></a> bindings,
which seem a bit unloved compared to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs"><code>wgpu-rs</code></a>.
There's <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/issues/53">one obvious bug</a>
which I encountered within 5 minutes,
and it's unclear how often it's synched with <code>wgpu-rs</code>'s releases.</p>
<p>It's frustrating needing <a href="https://github.com/google/shaderc"><code>shaderc</code></a>
to go from text to SPIR-V,
particularly because a full download unzips to 1.9GB (!!).
It looks like <a href="https://wgpu.rs/doc/naga/index.html"><code>naga</code></a>
aims to replace it, so I'm optimistic about the future!</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>This was a fun exercise, but I'm not planning to develop it any further.</p>
<p>(It's likely that I'll build a similar system in Rust,
next time I want a framework for semi-interactive graphics programming)</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof">on Github</a>,
and forks are welcome;
if one achieves critical momentum,
I'd be happy to link it here.</p>
<h2>Bonus Shader</h2>
<p>Here's a very bad Cornell Box Raytracer that I threw together,
basically so I could have a project thumbnail:</p>

December 29, 2020 | https://curvedlayer.com/2020/12/22/selling-in-public.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curvedlayer.com/2020/12/22/selling-in-public.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Building in Public is a well-established practice in the indie community. Resources like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank">Indie Hackers</a>, <a href="https://getmakerlog.com/" target="_blank">Makerlog</a>, and many others gave people the platform to share updates regularly while they are building products. This provided an enormous pool of insights for anyone interested in starting an independent business.</p>

<p>The problem I have with this term lies in the name. An over-emphasis on Building is what bothers me the most.</p>

<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters?</h3>
<p>Although Building in Public is a marketing tool, the term doesn’t constitute other required parts of product development. It creates a faulty belief that “building” is all it takes to lift the product off the ground.</p>

<h4 id="build-and-they-will-come">“Build, and they will come”:</h4>
<p>The overemphasis on the building makes you think that this is the biggest barrier for your product to succeed. It isn’t the case. You need to make sure you’re building the right thing, for the right people, solving big enough of a problem.</p>

<p>On top of that, you have to find the right communication channel. You can build whatever you want. But what difference does it make if nobody knows about it?</p>

<p>The idea that all you have to do is to build and everything else will take care of itself is nonsense. More so for people without any pre-existing audience.</p>

<h4 id="shameful-sales--marketing">Shameful Sales &amp; Marketing:</h4>
<p>Sales and marketing often have a bad rap in many communities. Reddit is known for “punishing” anyone with salesish motives. But you can’t conclude that “sales and marketing” is absolute evil based on poor execution.</p>

<p>Well executed sales and marketing are about providing value<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> while also telling your product’s story. The right balance between story and provided value is what makes good marketing &amp; sales.</p>

<h3 id="building-in-public--selling-in-public">Building in Public ‣ Selling in Public</h3>
<p>Sales and marketing are as important for the product as the building, if not more. The industry landscape shifted to the point where “building” beerier has been significantly reduced. By explicitly embracing “Selling in Public” we acknowledge the importance of those overlooked parts of the product work.</p>

<h4 id="no-code-tools">No-Code Tools:</h4>
<p>Right now, more than ever, the beerier to start building is low thanks to No-Code tools. You can get real with the majority of ideas without ever writing a line of code. Additionally, there are numerous No-Code communities like <a href="https://www.makerpad.co/" target="_blank">Makerpad</a> that would help anyone get started.</p>

<p><img src="https://curvedlayer.com/assets/images/2020-12-22-selling-in-public/makerpad.png" alt="Makerpad No-Code community" width="100%"></p>

<p>The challenge isn’t in the building. The challenge is to find the right thing to build and tell people about it. You can easily develop your own version of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> or <a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank">RemoteOK</a>. But only those with effective marketing channels will be able to take off the ground.</p>

<h4 id="examples-of-sales--marketing-that-gives-value">Examples of Sales &amp; Marketing that gives value:</h4>
<p>Sales don’t have to be shameful. Instead of pushing the same message across, focus on providing value while telling a story of the product you’re building.</p>


<p>Here is how <a href="https://twitter.com/pablostanley" target="_blank">Pablo Stanley</a> created a playlist of short tips on using Figma while also demonstrating <a href="https://blush.design/" target="_blank">Blush plugin</a> he’s building.</p>



<p>Another great example would be <a href="https://twitter.com/excid3" target="_blank">Chris Oliver</a>, who made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzEEfAj45zw" target="_blank">video guide</a> on deploying a Rails application while sharing about his product <a href="https://www.hatchbox.io/" target="_blank">Hatchbox</a> for those who don’t want to bother with the process.</p>

<h5 id="2-solve-smaller-but-relevant-problems">#2 Solve smaller but relevant problems</h5>

<p>Here, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau" target="_blank">Josh Comeau</a> made a simple <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/operator-lookup/" target="_blank">search for JavaScript operators</a>, while also telling a story about the <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/" target="_blank">CSS for JavaScript developers course</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://curvedlayer.com/assets/images/2020-12-22-selling-in-public/js-operators-search.png" alt="Search for JavaScript operators" width="100%"></p>

<p>Again, a great example from Pablo Stanley of the <a href="https://www.doodlestrudel.com/" target="_blank">tool that generates ideas of doodles</a> for illustrators, while mentioning about Blush as well.</p>

<p>Another example I really love was <a href="https://typefully.app/" target="_blank">Typefully</a>, a better tweeting experience from creators of <a href="https://mailbrew.com/" target="_blank">Mailbrew</a>, a tool that can deliver Twitter digest into your inbox.</p>



<p>In the spirit of providing value first, another example would be a content contribution to established communities. That’s precisely what we’ve been doing at Flawless App for a while with a community-driven Medium blog, free collections of design tools, and contribution to open-source newsletters like <a href="https://ios-goodies.com/" target="_blank">iOS Goodies</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios" target="_blank">Awesome iOS</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In reality, Building in Public works only when you’re selling to people who are interested in your journey. You need to have potential customers in “public” for the whole concept to work.</p>

<p>Calling out that sales and marketing contribute a great deal to the overall product success, along with the building, is important. It’s important because it’s honest.</p>

<![CDATA[Adding comments to a static blog with Mastodon]]>

  <section>
    <p>One of the biggest disadvantages of static site generators is that
they are static and can’t include comments.</p>
<p>There are multiples solutions to solve this problem. You could add
a third party blog engine like Disqus, but this has the drawback
of including a third-party tool with a bad privacy record in your
website. Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative
but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden. Having
to host a database was something we wanted to avoid with a
static site generator.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a better solution is to leverage the Mastodon and
Fediverse platform. Mastodon is a decentralized social network
and it allows people to communicate with each other without
being on the same server. It is inspired by Twitter, but instead
of tweeting, you write toot.</p>
<p>When publishing an article, you now only need to also write a
simple toot linking to your article. Then Mastodon has a simple
API to fetch the answer to your toot. This is the code I made for
my Hugo powered blog, but it is easily adaptable for other static
site generators. It will create a button to load comments instead
of loading them for every visitor so that it decreases the load on your
mastodon server.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A long time ago, I gave a talk in front of a full audience talking about BigchainDB, a company I worked for to create a (scalable) decentralized database. As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: "... and so by using our driver from within the browser, your app won't need a backend anymore"!</p>
<p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and started drinking Ethereum's web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly became something extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browser extension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it still is extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for "Decentralized Finance") websites. They allow a user to engage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups, you're able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p>
<p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library "web3.js". Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p>
<p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transfer the user's money.</p>
<p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user's browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on different websites.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that's web3. It's supposed to be a play on words regarding "web 2.0". Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories, specifically, let's say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked you how you'd envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3; you'd likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today. You'd think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed web standards. That's precisely not web3.</p>
<p>In today's experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites that crash or stop working when you've neglected to install Metamask (or other key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website's network console, you'll see that it's making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contract calls, what's even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either by someone hacking the website's server. Or by the website provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to rant, I'd now like to now point out what I think should change about web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shitty browser plugins!</li>
<li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li>
<li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) by dramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li>
<li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain's fundamental properties. Most data is immutable so let's start caching things.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumping the web's version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user's experience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. But let's come up with something better. Just imagine what happens once there's a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p>

<p>Growing your business can be fairly hard going at the best of times, let alone when facing uncertain and serious economic downshifts.</p>



<p>The 7 growth hacking tips featured below should if nothing else, help to focus your attention on areas that you can directly influence to fast track your online business growth.</p>



<h2>1. AUTOMATION</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Growth Hacking Tips 1 - Automation" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Whether you’re an established business or just starting out sooner or later you are going to have to use automation to free up your own time.</p>



<p>Picking tasks that automation can easily accomplish will help to streamline your business processes.</p>



<p>Automation will free up valuable time, leaving you to concentrate on key areas that require your fullest attention. </p>



<p>Importantly it will significantly increase your business productivity as a result.</p>

<h2>2. INVESTING</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Growth Hacking Tips 2 - Investing" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips1-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Risk unfortunately is very much like a business side-kick that appears uninvited right from the very start and then sadly sticks around for the duration.</strong></p>



<p>Money needs to be allocated for the inner working hubs of a business such as IT, software, skilled staff etc.</p>



<p>Spending wisely on getting the correct infrastructure in place will save a lot of potential headaches down the road.</p>



<p>A talented worker can for instance help accelerate  the pace of growth by their input, knowledge and skill.</p>

<h2>3. ACQUISITION</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Growth Hacking Tips 3 - Acquisition" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips2-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Customer acquisition will no doubt preoccupy most if not all of your waking thoughts.</p>



<p>The key to cutting out the worry element is to prepare as meticulously as possible before launching any promotional campaign.</p>



<p><strong>Patience, determination and perseverance should be your close cohorts as you seek to educate, engage with and encourage interaction with your prospective clients and customers.</strong></p>



<p>Defining your target audience and knowing exactly where they hang out in cyberspace will be crucial for speeding up acquisition, your conversion rates and lowering your costs too.</p>

<h2>4. ANALYSIS</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="G H Tips 4 - Analysis" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips3-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Without analysing what’s working and what isn’t there can be <strong>NO</strong> growth.</p>



<p>Simple as this may seem, it is pretty surprising how many businesses ignore the low hanging fruit  that lies within data analytics.</p>



<p> The ability to draw a composite picture, sectioning off more responsive lists for testing new products or services, trialling new offers or launching successful brand building campaigns can easily be gleaned from studying user behavioural patterns contained within the data.</p>

<h2>5. RETENTION</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="G H Tips 5 - Retention" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips4-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>OK so far, you’ve embraced automation, you’ve got the right personnel on board, you’re beginning to acquire some customers and you’ve analysed what makes them tick.</p>



<p><strong>HOORAY! YIPPEE! WELL DONE!</strong></p>



<p>Great, but now your work is only just beginning because your new found clients, customers and followers are about to become your biggest advocates and brand ambassadors.</p>



<p>Of course, there is a small matter of building up trust and loyalty first which shouldn’t really be an issue, as long as you keep on providing the quality of product and/or service that your customers have come to rely on. </p>



<p>Be transparent if &amp; when things go wrong, be quick to respond and make reparations or offer suitable alternatives where appropriate.</p>



<p>And above all keep your communications clear, concise and on point!</p>

<h2>6. REFERRALS</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="G H Tips 6 - Referrals" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips5-1.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now this is an area which can be particularly tricky or downright uncomfortable for some but think of it this way: </p>



<p><strong>If you’re servicing your customers well (no pun intended!) and they’re happy with you then, <em>why wouldn’t they want to promote your business to their friends and colleagues?</em></strong></p>



<p>Your clients and customers are one of your greatest assets so, treat them well and they will respond accordingly.</p>



<h2>7. JOINT VENTURES</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Growth H Tips - Joint Venture" srcset="https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.digitalhound.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/growth-hacking-tips6.jpg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This is a great way to piggy-back on your fellow  competitors’ customer databases.</p>



<p>Select ones that you feel might best compliment your business and offer to run joint sponsorship initiatives such as webinars, seminars, coaching sessions etc.</p>



<p><strong>Quote them in a blog post if appropriate and then ask them to share it with their customers, email lists, followers and so on.</strong></p>



<p>Generally speaking, if your tone of approach is one of respect and you are prepared to offer the right incentives then it’s highly likely that you will receive a favourable response.</p>



<h2>WRAPPING UP</h2>

<a href="https://aakinshin.net/tags/moving-quantile/">Moving Quantile</a></span></p><p>Imagine you have a time series.
Let’s say, after each new observation, you want to know an “average” value across the last <span>\(L\)</span> observations.
Such a metric is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average">a moving average</a>
(or rolling/running average).</p><p>The most popular moving average example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average">the moving mean</a>.
It’s easy to efficiently implement this metric.
However, it has a major drawback: it’s not robust.
Outliers can easily spoil the moving mean and transform it into a meaningless and untrustable metric.</p><p>Fortunately, we have a good alternative: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Moving_median">the moving median</a>.
Typically, it generates a stable and smooth series of values.
In the below figure, you can see the difference between the moving mean and the moving median on noisy data.</p><div><div><a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/moving-quantile-doubleheap/img/example-light.png" target="_blank" alt="example"><picture>

Today we going to discuss the Hardle-Steiger method to estimate the median
(memory: <span>\(O(L)\)</span>, element processing complexity: <span>\(O(log(L))\)</span>, median estimating complexity: <span>\(O(1)\)</span>).
Also, we will learn how to calculate <em>the moving quantiles</em> based on this method.</p><p>In this post, you will find the following:</p><ul><li>An overview of the Hardle-Steiger method</li><li>A simple way to implement the Hardle-Steiger method</li><li>Moving quantiles inspired by the Hardle-Steiger method</li><li>How to process initial elements</li><li>Reference C# implementation</li></ul><h3 id="an-overview-of-the-hardle-steiger-method">An overview of the Hardle-Steiger method</h3><p>This method is described in <a href="#Hardle1995">[Hardle1995]</a>.
The core idea is based on a data structure that contains two joined <a href="">heaps</a>:</p><div><p><a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/moving-quantile-doubleheap/img/double-heap.svg" target="_blank" alt="double-heap"><img width="400" src="https://aakinshin.net/posts/moving-quantile-doubleheap/img/double-heap.svg"></a></p></div><p>In this figure, you see an example for <span>\(L=21\)</span>.
It contains:</p><ul><li><span>\(H_1 .. H_{10}\)</span>: min heap</li><li><span>\(H_{-1} .. H_{-10}\)</span>: max heap</li><li><span>\(H_0\)</span>: a node that joins two heaps</li></ul><p>The <span>\(H\)</span> array contain the last <span>\(L\)</span> elements of the time series and satisfy the following conditions:</p><ul><li><span>\(\max(H_{-2i},\; H_{-2i-1}) \leq H_{-i} \leq H_0\)</span></li><li><span>\(\min(H_{2i},\; H_{2i+1}) \geq H_{i} \geq H_0\)</span></li></ul><p>Thus, <span>\(H_0\)</span> is
less than all elements in the upper heap (positive indexes) and
greater than all elements in the lower heap (negative indexes).
Since we have an equal number of elements in both heaps,
<span>\(H_0\)</span> represents the median value.</p><p>That’s all!
If we want to know the current value of the moving median, we should just take the value of <span>\(H_0\)</span>.
The suggested algorithm has the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>Amount of memory: <span>\(O(L)\)</span></li><li>Element processing complexity: <span>\(O(log(L))\)</span></li><li>Median estimating complexity: <span>\(O(1)\)</span></li></ul><p>Now we should learn how to invalidate this data structure for new observations.</p><h3 id="a-simple-way-to-implement-the-hardle-steiger-method">A simple way to implement the Hardle-Steiger method</h3><p>The most famous implementation of the Hardle-Steiger method is the <a href="http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/stats/src/Trunmed.c">Turlach implementation</a> in C.
It’s used in the R’s function <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/runmed">runmed</a>.
This implementation doesn’t look simple, so it’s not easy to replicate it using another language
(you can find a few StackOverflow discussion about this implementation
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1309263/184842">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5527437/184842">here</a>).
So, I looked at the above picture and came up with my own way to implement this algorithm
(you can find a reference C# implementation at the end of this post).
It differs from the Turlach implementation and from the suggested approach in the original paper,
but it still uses the same idea.</p><p>We are going to keep three array with numbers:</p><ul><li><code>double[] h</code>: the elements of the double-heap</li><li><code>int[] heapToElementIndex</code>: returns the original element index for the given heap element</li><li><code>int[] elementToHeapIndex</code>: returns the heap index for the given element index</li></ul><p>The swap routine is trivial:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cs"><span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>Swap</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>heapIndex1</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>heapIndex2</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div><p>To simplify the calculations, we take all the element indexes by modulo <span>\(L\)</span>.
Since we have exactly <span>\(L\)</span> subsequent indexes at each moment,
there are no index collisions.</p><p>When we get a new element <code>x[i]</code>, we should replace the <code>h[i % L]</code> value by <code>x[i]</code>.
Next, we should do a series of swaps to repair the heap conditions.
In the classic heap implementation, we usually have two <code>Sift</code> methods: <code>SiftUp</code> and <code>SiftDown</code>.
To reduce the number of cases, we are going to implement a generic <code>Sift</code> routine according to the following scheme:</p><ul><li>Consider the current heap node and lower neighbor nodes.
If we have any lower neighbor nodes that are larger than the current node,
we swap the current node with the node that has the maximum value (across considered nodes).</li><li>Otherwise, we consider the current heap node and the upper neighbor nodes.
Repeat the previous step with an opposite sign.</li><li>If we swapped the current node with a lower or upper neighbor node,
we repeat two previous steps with the new node location.
Otherwise, we stop.</li></ul><p>This logic still have a lot of cases that should be handled,
but it’s not so hard to implement it.
See the reference implementation at the end of this post for details.</p><h3 id="moving-quantiles-inspired-by-the-hardle-steiger-method">Moving quantiles inspired by the Hardle-Steiger method</h3><p>The original algorithm was designed only for the moving median.
Let’s generalize it to calculate any moving quantile.</p><p>We can express the Hardle-Steiger method in terms of order statistics.
For the given odd <span>\(L\)</span>, we can define <span>\(k = (L-1)/2\)</span>.
The median element across the last <span>\(L\)</span> numbers is the <span>\((k+1)^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element (assuming one-base indexing).
<span>\(H_0\)</span> is the request number because it’s larger than all of the elements in the lower heap (which contains exactly <span>\(k\)</span> elements) and smaller than all of the elements in the upper heap (which also contains <span>\(k\)</span> elements).</p><p>Now let’s change the heap sizes!
For any <span>\(k \in [0; L-1]\)</span>, we can consider the lower heap of size <span>\(k\)</span> and the upper heap of size <span>\(L-k-1\)</span>.
In this case, <span>\(H_0\)</span> will represent the <span>\((k+1)^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element.
The <span>\(p^\textrm{th}\)</span> quantile (<span>\(p \in [0; 1]\)</span>) can be estimated as the <span>\(\lfloor p(L-1) \rfloor^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element!
Note that now the window size can be an arbitrary positive number
(unlike the original approach which supports only odd <span>\(L\)</span> values).</p><p>It looks simple, so I was surprised that I didn’t manage to find this idea anywhere.
If you find any references where this approach is explained, please let me know.</p><h3 id="how-to-process-initial-elements">How to process initial elements</h3><p>Let’s say that the windows size <span>\(L=21\)</span>, we estimate the median <span>\(k=10\)</span>,
but we are at the beginning of our time series, and we have only 13 elements.
What should we return?
There two possible strategies here:</p><ul><li><strong>Order Statistics</strong><br>Since the <span>\(k^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element was requested, we should return it.
In the above example, it would be the <span>\(10^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element from the 13 observed numbers.</li><li><strong>Quantile Approximation</strong><br>Since the median was requested, we should return it.
In the above example, it would be <span>\(7^\textrm{th}\)</span> smallest element from the 13 observed numbers.</li></ul><p>Also, there are other strategies (e.g., repeating the first element).
However, in my opinion, other approaches don’t satisfy the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>,
so we are not going to discuss them.</p><p>The two presented strategy define the way of the heap initialization (how we process <span>\(x[i]\)</span> for <span>\(i &lt; L\)</span>).
We start with two empty heaps.
Once we got the first element, we always put it into <span>\(H_0\)</span>.
Next, we should add subsequent elements to the lower or upper heap depending on the chosen strategy:</p><ul><li><strong>Order Statistics</strong><br>We add elements to the lower heap until it’s full.
After that, we add elements to the upper heap.</li><li><strong>Quantile Approximation</strong><br>We choose the lower or upper heap trying to keep the ratio
<span>\(\textrm{LowerHeapSize} / (\textrm{LowerHeapSize} + \textrm{UpperHeapSize})\)</span>
close to the target quantile.</li></ul><h3 id="reference-c-implementation">Reference C# implementation</h3><p>Below you can find a full C# implementation of the moving quantile according to the above approach.

    <p>But first, something completely different. Sometime in 2015 I caught wind of Elon Musk. There was something relatable in the way he spoke about being bullied, education <sup>(1)</sup>, and the future. His demeanor lit a spark that made me realign with myself, resurrecting my usual optimistic outlook. Further still, I became enamored by his companies which reinvigorated my long-lost curiosity and fascination with science. Waking up in the morning became exciting again; similar to my 10-year-old self during the summer: not a care in the world, ready to explore.</p>

    <p>Not being able to afford a Tesla car, the only way I could support him was through buying Tesla shares. So that's what I did, at the all-time high, right before it plummeted. In a fit of panic I wanted to sell, but the revolutionary workings of its cars and the Gigafactory, and their abundance of talent reassured me they were vastly ahead of the game. So I kept buying until the graph bottomed out, and soon enough my portfolio turned green. That the stock market closes at night and during the weekends made the whole experience tenable, more relaxed. But not for long.</p>

    <h2>“Drinking the Kool-Aid”</h2>
    <p>“is an expression used to refer to a person who believes in a possibly doomed or dangerous idea because of perceived potential high rewards.” <sup>(2)</sup></p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/kool-aid-man.png" alt="Kool-Aid man."></p><p>On Reddit I met a fellow Tesla fan who said his two most profitable investments were Tesla and bitcoin. Initially I didn't bother, but some three months later it reappeared. My motivations for investing had begun to shift. Primarily supporting a cause and secondarily making some money—beating inflation—traded places. Profit took precedence.</p>

    <p>At a price of $1200 and rising I drank the decentralized Kool-Aid. Each day I woke up richer—on paper. The increases that took Tesla several months happened overnight, and owning a million dollars grew less and less farfetched. “This is not a bubble. This time is different. We're at the start of the adoption curve.” Man, it felt good! In my naivety I dreamt about buying a house, or building a skate park named after bitcoin. I was high on “hopium” and living in a fantasy world. Gradually my time spent learning, reading, or developing real life skills decreased. Being rich became the ultimate goal and I merely had to sit back and watch. Then the bubble popped, “Kansas went bye-bye”.</p>

    <p>“If only I had done this or that” was my prevailing mode of thought, “I could've had so much more!” Although I never day traded, I did diversify, no, gamble into a handful of alternative coins in order to try my luck catching the next 400% price pump. No dice. I wasted so much time waiting for it “to moon” or trying to “catch falling knives” <sup>(3)</sup>. Not only were the results as succesful as dart throwing chimps <sup>(4)</sup>, it also significantly increased my anxiety. The regular stock market seldom impacted my day-to-day emotions, but the 24/7 cryptocurrency market did—more than I consciously realize or care to admit. At one point I had my intestines checked because my doctor feared cancer. Fortunately it was a false alarm, and the symptoms caused by a mild inflammation subsided when I stopped stress eating junk food. If only I listened to my body and did a U-turn at this point. Sadly, greed had taken over; I wanted to procure the same amount of profit as if I had never diversified.</p>

    <p>While the bear market was still in play I finished reading The Bitcoin Standard, the most revered book on bitcoin, promoting it as the best currency we've ever had. Still oblivious about its toxic community, and neglecting some of the book's historical inaccuracies, I assumed the content was credible and genuine since the author was a professor in economics. Moreover, after sending him a list of typos and errors he returned the favor by giving me access to his paywalled pdf files. To be able to help such an esteemed professor made me feel elated. I was ready to go all in, and I did. Selling my remaining Tesla shares at $290 at a loss to buy bitcoin at the bottom simultaneously marked my own rock-bottom, for I was dabbing in evil. Even though I was extremely lucky by having caught a falling knife an inch from the floor, I started rooting for a decline in the former and a surge in the latter. Imagine my saltiness when Tesla suddenly shot up to just shy of $1000. Bitcoin had risen as well, but it wasn't good enough. Dumbass.</p>

    <h2>“My precious!”</h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/smeagol.jpg" alt="Smeagol or Gollum; Lord of the Rings."></p><p>“He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.” <br>
    “What do you mean?” said Frodo. “Surely the Ring was his Precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?” <br>
    “You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,” said Gandalf. “He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.” —<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings">“The Lord of the Rings”</a> by J.R.R. Tolkien</p>

    <p>Slowly I became like Gollum. Which is ironic because I love The Lord of the Rings for the exact opposite reasons: calling for adventure, exploration, to love your friends, and to live in harmony with nature. Instead I fell in love with “my precious”, sitting at home watching numbers, albeit in the comfort of a picturesque wallpaper. Bitcoin made me as selfish and greedy as the bankers it was supposed to be against.</p>

    <p>If not for skateboarding I wouldn't have stayed sane. It pulled me out of isolation and held my soul intact despite being otherwise bereft of life. Bitcoin's one redeeming quality, because it temporarily made me feel rich, was that I learned to spend more generously on things that merited it, like skateboarding or lichess.org <sup>(5)</sup>. Whereas before I tried saving on nearly everything.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward to some months before Covid-19. Something smelled fishy. Bitcoin's price had been rising, which was exciting, but some doubts arose about the aforementioned professor: Saifedean Ammous. I stumbled upon his Twitter profile… “What the fuck.” The amount of conspiratorial nonsense mixed with academically dishonest douchebaggery was flabbergasting. “Is this guy really a professor?” I gave him the benefit of the doubt until I emailed him regarding meat, a topic he regularly rants about. The full convo is available in the appendix, but here's a taste:</p>

    <p>“I need an echo chamber because the world is FULL of brainwashed malnourished clueless nuts like you”</p>

    <p>I'm not proud of my conversation with him, but the way he talked like a neglected pubescent brat taught me to assume good intentions yet scrutinize everyone; even if they have a PhD to their name. “Saifegate” severely shook my confidence: “If this guy wrote the most popular book on bitcoin, then what the fuck does the rest of its community consist of?”</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin is dead inside.</h2>
    <p>From then on toxic bitcoin maximalists (and crypto currency nuts) appeared everywhere. Remember that “fishy smell” from before? It turned into dogshit. What bitcoin stood for had transitioned the way I had. It wasn't about changing the world anymore, but about increasing one's own wallet. My disregard culminated at the sight of the following series of events:</p>

    <p>“Just BTFD #bitcoin” —Adam Back</p>

    <p>“Btw it was what I did this morning "Just BTFD #bitcoin

    <p>If a CEO that feels the need to encourage people into buying a product he has vested interests in isn't a red flag, then I don't know what is; products should speak for themselves. The possibility of him being Satoshi Nakamoto didn't help either:</p>

        <div><p>A <span><a title="Longitudinal Study into Violent Video Games" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2020.0049">ten-year longitudinal study</a></span>&nbsp;published in the Journal of <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</em> on a group in early adolescence from as young as ten years old, investigated how playing violent video games at an early age would translate into adulthood behavior (23 years of age). Titled "Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents" the study found no correlation between growing up playing video games and increased levels of aggression ten years later.</p><p>This particular study utilized a more contemporary approach for analyzing its data, known as the person-centered approach. Traditional studies use a variable-centered approach whereby researchers treat each variable, or characteristic, as related to another variable. An example would be that exercising is related to a reduced incidence of heart disease. This has been particularly valuable when comparing groups. In a person-centered approach researchers combine various algorithms across variables to determine how these variables compare among individuals. This approach provides a more accurate depiction of how variables relate to the individual.</p><p>As such, this study “accounts for heterogeneity, grouping individuals who are similar and who share a set of characteristics that vary similarly over time.” Participant families were recruited through “a large north-western city” beginning in 2007 (Wave 1) via telephone directories and required to complete questionnaires. 65% were Caucasian, 12% black and 19% multi-ethnic, 4% other. Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add to and diversify the sample group.</p><p>Video game violence ratings were assessed through the Common Sense Media, known to be a viable rating body for media. Participants were assessed through various behavioral characteristics such as aggression, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Results showed that boys played more violent video games than girls. Groups displayed three forms of video game play, according to the study: high-initial violence (4%) which indicated individuals played a high-level of violent video games at an early age, moderate initial violence (23%) whereby violent video game play was moderate at an early age, and low initial violence (73%).</p><p>The study concluded that group with low initial violence “was no higher in aggressive behavior than the high initial violence group at the final time point.” Therefore, it is determined that adolescents who played a high-level of violent video games at an early age did not show more aggressive behavior later in life than those who played fewer to no hours of violent video games at an early age.</p></div>

      <p><img alt="git cake: when is my README's birthday?" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhupesh-V/Bhupesh-V.github.io/master/images/git-cake-day-demo.png"></p><p>Do you want to know when was a file/directory committed in your git repo?
Well here is <code>git log</code> at your rescue!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
git log <span>--date</span><span>=</span>format:<span>'%d %b %Y'</span> <span>--diff-filter</span><span>=</span>A <span>--name-only</span> <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>'%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)'</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34342551/103223519-6b366080-494c-11eb-9d54-acebd0179ffb.png" alt="git-cake-demo-paager"></p>

<p>Ok ok! Let me explain for you lazy asses</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>--date=format:'%d %b %Y'</code></p>

    <p>This is pretty much self explanatory, suit this to your own preferred date format. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt---dateltformatgt">Other date formats</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>--diff-filter=A --name-only</code></p>

    <p>This lets you filter nodes that were Added(A). Other filters include: Copied(C), Deleted(D), Modified(M) or Renamed(R).
Multiple filters can be used together e.g <code>--diff-filter=AC</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>--name-only</code> shows only names of changed files. If you had like to print some status as well use <code>--name-status</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>--pretty='%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)</code></p>

    <p>This is the beauty that is responsible for printing <code>🎂️ 18 Jun 2019 by (f72312c)</code>.</p>

    <p>Git provides us with various format specifiers these include.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>%n  : newline</li>
      <li>%h  : abbreviated commit hash (short version, use %H for complete hash)</li>
      <li>%ad : author date that respects the previously specified –date= option</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats"><strong>Read git pretty docs</strong></a> for info. on all 50+ options</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read more than 2000 lines worth of git log manual (<code>git log --help</code>) when you feel absolutely free :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should add this in your <code>.gitconfig</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[user]
	email = varshneybhupesh@gmail.com
	name = Bhupesh-V
[commit]
	template = /home/bhupesh/.gitmessage
[core]
	editor = nano
[credential]
	helper = store
[alias]
        cake = log --date=format:'%d %b %Y' --diff-filter=A --name-only --pretty='%n%C(yellow bold)🎂️ %ad%Creset by (%C(blue bold)%h%Creset)'

            <div id="content">

		<article>

		<p id="article_date">30 April 2012</p>

		

		<p><a href="http://www.bonkersworld.net/building-software/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="The life of a software engineer..." height="342" src="https://www.ben-morris.com/images/refactoring-vs-rewriting.gif" title="The life of a software engineer... as found on bonkersworld.net" width="450"></a>Developers and architects like to build things, so their initial impulse is often to flatten the place, lay some stronger foundations and build something impressive. It can be difficult to get them excited about incremental innovation, even when this is generally the most sensible approach from both a technical and commercial perspective.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a> wrote a post back in 2000 about Netscape's decision to rewrite their browser from scratch in the late 1990s. It's as relevant today as it was more than ten years ago. He described the rewrite as "<em>the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make</em>" and I am inclined to agree. It took several years during which Netscape watched helplessly as their market share plummeted. Would iterative releases of a troubled code base really have been so bad an alternative?</p>
<h2>Developers can't help it - they just want to write new code</h2>
<p>Netscape provides an extreme example but technical teams often lobby to rewrite "legacy" code. The argument in favour of a rewrite is pretty obvious to them. The code is riddled with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">technical debt</a>&nbsp;accumulated through years of compromises and quick fixes. It's slowing them down and restricting their ability to deliver enhancements. This may be true to a degree, but it's often the developer's natural reluctance to work with code written by somebody else that lies at the heart of this argument.</p>
<p>Peter Hallam suggested that&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/peterhal/archive/2006/01/04/509302.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">developers spend more time&nbsp;<em>understanding</em>&nbsp;code</a>&nbsp;then they do actually writing it. If you are modifying code then you have to take the time to figure out what it does before you can adjust it. Understanding code written by somebody else requires considerable patience and it can be very tempting to dive in and start writing your own version instead.</p>
<p>Developers tend to be dismissive of code written by somebody else. This is often unfair as any difficulties may caused unfamiliaty rather than the original author's poor technique. Everybody has their own coding style, their favourite tricks and their own way of doing things. No coding standards will overcome the fact that another developer's code is always going to seem strange. Better developers will generally have the discipline to understand <em>why</em> code has been written a certain way before dismissing it.</p>
<h2>Nobody sets out to write bad code</h2>
<p>Any developer who is working on a long-established code base will tell you what a <em>mess</em> it is. There will be horror stories of methods several hundred lines long and classes of byzantine complexity. If only they were given the chance to rewrite it they would produce a clean, focused architecture that would be good for many years to come.</p>
<p>The problem is that nobody ever means to write bad code. <em>Bad code happens to good developers</em>.&nbsp;Requirements change, deadlines requires "quick and dirty" solutions that are never remedied, requirements turn out to be more complex than you originally thought. Software development does not happen in isolation and it has to interact with an uncertain environment dominated by unstable budgets and behaviour.</p>
<p>Technical debt is a fact of life on every software development project and it is not going to be completely cleared by a rewrite. You are just as likely to exchange one set of issues for another.&nbsp;You can try to protect yourself with flexible software design, create loosely coupled components and define clear responsibilities. Whatever you do, another set of developers will still come along in a few years and dismiss your code a muddle.</p>
<h2>How do you measure technical debt?</h2>
<p>It may seem obvious to developers&nbsp;that it's time to pay down the technical debt&nbsp;that has built up through years of quick fixes, but&nbsp;it's generally less clear to commercial stakeholders. Code rewrite projects are difficult to sell because you aren't necessarily delivering anything <em>new</em>. The stakeholders have already paid to have this stuff written and feel that they are being asked to pay again just to have it written <em>properly</em>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to quantify technical debt in any meaningful way because it is generally justified in terms of its effect on productivity. This is notoriously tricky to measure in any meaningful way due to difficulties in identifying reliable metrics for typical development activities such as implementing new features and fixing bugs.</p>
<p>Given how hard it is to build a meaningful business case for a code rewrite it is often easier to focus on improving smaller, more specific functional areas. If it works out then you will find it easier to justify further investment in improvement.&nbsp;An iterative approach based on refactoring is always easier to sell than a big bang with vaguely defined returns.</p>
<p>There does come a point at which technical debt becomes overwhelming, of course. Old code can be left for so long that it can fall too far behind prevailing industry technologies. This can create compatibility problems and form a genuine barrier to new feature development. Attracting and retaining a development team can become difficult and expensive if your code is based on legacy technology. This is the point at which iterative refactoring can start to seem like an anaemic response.</p>
<h2>That messy code is more valuable than it looks</h2>
<p>Bear in mind that the large slab of nasty source code that few people really understand often represents many years of investment and effort. It's a major chunk of intellectual property that underpins revenue generation and you should think carefully before throwing it away.</p>
<p>Established code contains a lot of encapsulated knowledge earned through years of testing and real world use. Old code may be cantankerous and difficult to understand, but it usually&nbsp;<em>works</em>. There is no reason why your replacement system will be more reliable than the original, in fact, it will probably be worse as you find mistakes to make and create a new set of bugs to find and fix.</p>

<p>If you are looking at Raspberry Pi alternatives in 2021 there is a range of options at various specifications and prices. Although at the time of writing some of these options are yet to be released I believe that they will be relevant within the next few months. </p>



<p>Raspberry Pi alternatives have always been an interest to me as they often create innovating products before the Raspberry Pi foundation. This is not to say I have anything against Raspberry Pi’s they are absolutely the well deserved leader in this market and still offer the best support and community. </p>



<div><p>If anyone believes I have missed a Raspberry Pi alternative from the list please comment below and I will review it and potentially add it to the list. </p><p>Watch this space as a good amount of the SBC’s mentioned in this list will be reviewed by myself in early 2021.   </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Jetons or counters were used as calculation instruments in
Europe in the middle ages. According to medieval taste, they
were always decorated. These decorations always had a
purpose, sometimes religious, but usually related to the user or the
principal. In the 16th century, jetons were mostly used to
propagate political messages and to glorify the deeds of the ruler.
There was such a great need to make propaganda through jetons
that they continued to be struck long after jetons ceased to be used
as counters. In France and in the Netherlands this new image of
the jeton began about the end of the 16th century. The jeton
became a small commemorative medal only suitable as a collectors
item. The development in Germany was slightly different.
In the course of the 17th century the counters became smaller
and smaller, for little by little they were only used as chips for
card-playing. Real jetons are metallic thin flat discs and are
struck like coins. The differences from coins are: the metal is
generally copper or brass and seldom silver. Gold jetons are very
rare. The measure is always between ca. 20 mm and ca. 28 mm.
Smaller or larger pieces cannot be used as reckoning counters.
The relief is always low for easy pushing and making piles. (In
France the jetons were mostly laid down overlapping, as shown
in the figure). Jetons are not coins, so they never have an indication
of value.
</p><p>
The copper jeton shown in
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet1.jpg">Figure 1</a>
is a good example of a
reckoning counter of the Low Countries of the 16th century. The
type on the obverse is heraldic. The legend gives the name and
the title of the principal of this jeton, Maximilian of Bergen op
Zoom, bishop of Cambray (now in France). The legend of the
reverse is the motto of the bishop: "neither quick nor rash,"
which is symbolized by a beautiful clock. The jeton is dated as
usual in this period.
</p><p>
In ancient times the Greeks and Romans mostly used pebbles or
bone disks for their calculations. This was cheaper than a
beadframe, although we know that the Romans also used abaci.
Usually the pebbles were half bulb-shaped pieces of limestone.
The Romans called them "calculi" (singular: calculus =
limestone, pebble), the origin of our word "calculation." In
counting the pebbles were pushed over a counter-board with
lines. The counter-board was used in the same way as the
counter-frame.
</p><p>
Calculating with jetons was always accompanied by registering
the numbers in Roman figures.
</p><p>
There were no strict rules for higher numbers. XXVIII.CCCCXXXII
and XXVIII<sup>m</sup>IIII<sup>c</sup>XXXII were both possible for 28,432.
Abbreviations as MCM for 1900 were not usual in the middle-ages.
</p><p>
After the fall of the Roman Empire, international trade was
reduced, therefore the need of calculating became less.
However, thanks to churches and convents which had to figure
out the dates of the changing church festivals, calculating with
jetons had not been forgotten and the revival of trade in
Northern Italy and France in the 12th and 13th centuries made it
necessary again. In the meantime in Western Europe the
beadframe abacus had definitely made room for the jetons which
were exclusively made of metal and usually, just like coins,
struck in copper and brass.
</p><p>
The calculating took place on a board with lines.
Counter-boards with inlaid lines have been kept through the ages in
private collections or museums. A cloth with embroidered lines
was used very incidentally (for example at the yearly verification
of the city-accounts) because of the quick wear and tear.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet2.gif">Figure 2</a>
is a woodcut from Gregor Reisch's <em>Margarita
Philosophica</em>, Freiburg, 1503, an early German book about
arithmetic. Here "Arithmetica" is symbolized by a woman
holding two books with the two different ways of calculation.
The mathematician Pythagoras is shown calculating with jetons
on a counter-table, while the philosopher Boethius is ciphering
with Arabic figures.
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jeta.gif">Figure a</a>
shows a counter-board with the
figure 123. The cross at the fourth line, or thousand-line, was
intended to help the eye like the comma that marks off the
thousands in Arabic figures.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet3.jpg">Figure 3</a>
shows the same figure 123 on a reckoning-cloth,
made by the wife of the author.
</p><p>
In the course of the 13th century scientists of Western
Europe gradually learned how to make use of Arabic figures and
discovered the meaning of the figure zero (= an empty space on
the counter-board). Now also the Christian world knew how to
make calculations by pen-reckoning and the abacus and Roman
figures were no longer needed. It still took a few centuries before
everyone at school learned how to pen-reckon. Invention of the
printing-press quickened this process. Printed arithmetic books
reached many more people than had ever been possible through
oral instructions. Below are some examples of calculating with
jetons or counters. Here is dealt with only the most simple form
of plain calculation. Other systems were used for money-counting.
</p><div>
Put the figures down, separated by the vertical line.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetb.gif">figure b</a>)
<p>
Actually we already have the answer, but after simplification
the result is shown much clearer: Remove 5 counters from
the bottom line and put instead a counter in the V-space between
the I-line and the X-line. This one together with the counter
already being in the V-space are replaced by one counter on the
X-line. Now we have five counters on the X-line which we
replace by one in the L-space. (If you cannot see through
anymore there is only one solution: Draw a few lines on a piece
of paper and do the addition yourself with a few dimes or
something like it.) Finally we replace the two L-counters by one
on the C-line and we see the number CCCI or 301.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetc.gif">figure c</a>)
</p><p>
Subtraction is done in the same way.
</p><center>
<h2>
MULTIPLICATION
</h2>
</center>
<p>
It is more difficult to multiply and divide. Yet the operations
on the counter-board are easier to understand than
pen-reckoning. Example: CCLXXXV x XXIII (285 x 23 = )
Put down both figures
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet5.jpg">Figure 5</a>).
</p><p>
First we multiply 285 by 10. In Arabic figures a zero is added
to 285: 285 x 10 = 2850. On the counter-board it is as easy. Push
all the counters one line up
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet6.jpg">Figure 6</a>,
right).
Double this result, which makes the multiplication 20 times
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet7.jpg">Figure 7</a>).
First simplify. To indicate that we have multiplied by 20,
we remove the 2 X-counters from 23.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet8.jpg">Figure 8</a>).
</p><p>
Multiplying by 3 is done the easiest on the left side of the
board. 3 x 285 is carried out as 3 x 200 + 3 x 80 + 3 x 5
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet9.jpg">Figure 9</a>).
</p><p>
Finally the two figures are joined, see
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet10.jpg">Figure 10</a>,
and simplified
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet11.jpg">Figure 11</a>).
</p><p>
You may verify the result with pen-reckoning or calculator
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet12.jpg">Figure 12</a>).
</p><center>
<h2>
DIVISION
</h2>
</center>
<p>
The arithmetic book of Robert Recorde, <em>The Grounds of
Artes Teaching the Worke and Practice of Arithmetik</em>, first
published in 1542 in London, provides us with the last example. This
book contains not only the teaching of pen-reckoning but also
how the old method with counters could be used together with
the new Arabic figures. "If 225 sheepe cost 45&nbsp;£, what did
each sheep cost? To know this, I should divide the whole
somme, that is 45&nbsp;£ by 225, but that cannot be: Therefore must I
first reduce that 45&nbsp;£ into a lesser denomination, as into shillings,
then I multiplie 45 by 20, and it is 900: these two numbers
therefore I set thus.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetd.gif">figure d</a>)
</p><p>
Then I begin at the highest line of the dividend, and seeke
how often I may have the divisor therein, and that I may doe
foure times..." The explanation that follows is not very clear.
Probably Recorde hasn't calculated with counters very often
himself. Division is explained only in a few of the arithmetic
books from the 16th century that I consulted.
</p><p>
According to those books the pupil had to do by heart all the
multiplications that were necessary for dividing; only subtraction
was done on the counter-board. We may say that dividing
was one of the least practised operations.
</p><p>
To understand by experience, I divided XXVIII.CCCCXXXII
by CCCVII (28,432 divided by 357). Including laying out the
necessary multiplications it took about 10 minutes before I
found out that the answer was LXXVIIII with a remainder of
CCXXVIIII. I needed 43 counters for this calculation. It seemed
sensible to do the verification by a calculator.
</p><p>
A trained reckoner could probably do it much faster,
although a counter-board was always slower than a bead-frame
abacus, for pushing is done more quickly than putting down and
taking away.
</p><p>
In his <em>The Japanese Abacus</em> (1954), Takashi Kojima describes
a contest between the Japanese abacus or soroban and the
electric calculating machine (not a modern electronic one!) which
was held in Tokyo on November 12, 1946 under the sponsorship
of the U.S. Army newspaper, the <em>Stars and Stripes</em>. In reporting
the contest, the <em>Stars and Stripes</em> remarked: "The machine age
took a step backward yesterday at the Ernie Pyle Theater as the
abacus, centuries old, dealt defeat to the most up-to-date electric
machine now being used by the United States government ...
The abacus victory was decisive."
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet13.jpg">Figure 13</a>
is a small modern Japanese soroban with bamboo
rods and with four beads on the lower section and one on the
upper. Each of the four beads on the lower section of a rod has the
value of 1, while the bead on the upper section of the rod has the
value of 5. Each of the 1-unit beads below the beam obtains its
value when it is moved up toward the beam, and loses its value
when it is moved back down. The 5-unit bead obtains its value
when it is moved down to the beam, etc. The soroban in the
illustration shows the figure 123.
</p><p>
One of the different systems of counting with jetons is shown in
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet14.jpg">Figure 14</a>.
This is the title page of Robrecht van
Heusden's <em>Reken-boechsken</em>, Antwerp, 16th century. At the far
left is laid down a column (vertical) of jetons, generally called the
"tree." The lowest marks the row of unit jetons, the next above
the ten jetons, and so on. The five jeton has to be placed in the
space between the lowest and the second jeton of the tree.

<h6><strong><em>No. 1</em></strong></h6>



<h6><strong>Don’t</strong> cram the night before and/or try to pull of an all nighter</h6>



<p>I know you don’t want to hear it, but cramming is not effective at all. You tend to only remember the information you have learned on the beginning and the end of your entire study session. You will most likely have a problem with recalling the information you’ve tried to learn in the middle. In case you do have to cram a lot of information at once, try to study the most important information at the beginning and at the end. But you do have to have some kind of information in the middle, you can’t just learn “the end and the beginning”.</p>



<p>Also, you will not be able to recall almost any of the information, in less than five days. Our brain will not consider it important enough to store it into your long-term memory. I’ll get to that later in this article.</p>



<h6><em><strong>No. 2</strong></em></h6>



<h6>Hilighting will <strong>not</strong> do the trick</h6>



<p>A commonly used study technique is using highlighters. This does not come in handy if you are trying to remember something, especially, if you end up highlighting the entire textbook like a coloring book. Yes, this may help you, during making a structural list of topics or important vocabulary for the topic. You won’t actually learn anything, just by adding color. This may serve as a guideline within the text itself (e. g. where can you find information, once you really start studying)</p>



<h6><strong><em>No. 3</em></strong></h6>



<h6>Space it out!</h6>



<p>Most students hate this advice, <g id="8" data-gr-id="8">me</g> included, but it really does work. If you space out the amount of information, within a longer period of time, you will be more effective. To understand the real reason behind this, we have to understand the psychology behind our memory.</p>



<p>Our brain can’t remember everything. That’s why we remember only things that are important for some reason. Of course, that huge amounts of information you are supposed to remember for a test will most likely not be so interesting&nbsp;for you to remember everything about it. So, to get your brain to consider it as important you have to slightly “cheat” the brain.</p>



<p>And, how do we do that? By taking the information and studying it over and over, which I know sounds ridiculous, you will get to the point, where your brain “thinks” that since you’ve been recapping it so many times, the information must be important for some reason. Because of this, you are much more likely to remember things <g id="315" data-gr-id="315">you’ve</g> done many times in the past.</p>

<h6><strong><em>No. 4</em></strong></h6>



<h6>Look at some study materials ahead of time</h6>



<p>By doing so, you will have a rough guidline. Some high schools make you do worksheets, where you write information from your textbooks down, or some teachers may just advise you to read it. Because of doing this, you will know the structure, and fewer things will surprise you. And if there is some vocabulary you don’t fully understand, you can just look it up. Even just actively reading through it will get you to think about it and sort the information logically in your memory.</p>



<h6><strong><em>No. 5 </em></strong></h6>



<h6>Look at your notes within a few hours after writing them</h6>



<p>By reviewing the notes from class every evening you will achieve a very important effect on you learning the information. According to many <g id="9" data-gr-id="9">researches</g> and studies <g id="10" data-gr-id="10">done</g> in the past few years, we forget about 50 to 75% of learned information learned only 24 hours before. In other words, most people will be able to recall only about 25 to 35 % of information learned only 24 hours ago. The 24 hours are crucial. </p>



<p>Most studies have found, that we can recall most information within 1 to 2 hours after learning it. To stop, or at least slow down the process of forgetting all of it, all you have to <g id="7" data-gr-id="7">do,</g> is to look at your notes and quickly go through them. This way, you still remember things from class and you connect it to your notes.</p>

<h6><em><strong>No.&nbsp;6</strong></em></h6>



<h6> Retrieval Practice </h6>



<p>By simply reading your notes over and over for two hours, your effectivity of learning is on its minimum. The way to make all of this more effective, and spend much less time doing something so ineffective, is to simply write it down. You call also find practice test online or use apps such as <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>.&nbsp;By doing so, you have to reach into your memory to find the information needed. By reading your notes over and over you will never achieve that, since the information is simply still right in front of you, so, technically, there is no good reason for you to even try to engage your brain and recall the information at all. </p>



<h6><strong><em>No. 7</em></strong></h6>



<h6>Have an intention with your knowledge </h6>



<p>By learning something “just cause” is usually not enough. You need to have a good reason to remember the information that’s put in front of you.</p>



<p>In a pretty recent study <em>(2014) </em>conducted by John Nestojko called <em>Expecting to teach enhances learning and organization of knowledge in free recall of text passages,</em> it has been shown that by telling students they will have to teach the topic, later on, has completely changed their mindset. They understood the topic better and were able to engage in a more effective way in comparison to the group which only expected a test on the end of the chapter.</p>



<h6><strong><em>No. 8</em></strong></h6>



<h6>Exercise before a study session</h6>



<p>Working out before a study session has shown being more alert, awake and active during studying. Even after a short workout, your brain is getting more oxygen, and your entire body is in an “active state”, your blood is pumping faster through your body and you <g id="133" data-gr-id="133">is</g> more alert. You are more awake and ready to do something active.</p>



<h6><em><strong>No.&nbsp;9</strong></em></h6>



<h6>Find conections</h6>



<p>It has been scientifically proven, that knowing and if you can, finding connections by yourself, is one of the most effective ways to memorize even a lot of information. This happens, because it is generally easier to remember a process or even order rather than a long list of information. By finding the connections you will find that the topic and all of the terms are somehow connected and most likely even make sense to why they are the way they are.</p>



<p>A good “extra tip” to this might be to find as many conections by yourself or with the help of a friend, but activley paticipate in the process of figuring it out. This will help you to remember it, since we, as humans have a tendency to remember thing we did on our own better than other things, we didn’t take a part in.</p>







<p>I hope some fo those scientifically proven techniques are going to work for you, good luck with studying!</p>

      <blockquote>Life and business have a way of complicating themselves over time. So the goal as an entrepreneur should be start off with as simple a premise as possible, which then over time will evolve and become nuanced, layered and complicated. But if you start with complicated, you end up with chaos.</blockquote><p>In the <a href="https://www.instamojo.com/thestartupcentre/venture-consultation-fee/">consult sessions</a> that I do with entrepreneurs, for those who are in the idea stage, the goal is to get to a simple goal for the business. If we can arrive at that, then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit">PMF</a> (usually) isn't too far behind. But simple is difficult to achieve and takes clarity of thought.</p><p>There are two business models when it comes to B2B that ring true always. </p><ol><li>Are you helping a business save money? (tends to grow rapidly during times of scarcity - like right now) - or</li><li>Are you helping a business make more money? (grows when the market is in expansion mode).</li></ol><hr><p>There is a SaaS startup that keeps track of all your SaaS Subscriptions across departments, and notifies the accounts department of tools that are under-utilized or not used at all for a while. <strong>In effect, it helps the org saves money.</strong></p><p>With SaaS, you put your credit card it and forget about it, and sometimes between departments the same tool is purchased multiple times, and sometimes a tool is bought, forgotten and still billed for. The Average enterprise with ~ 1000 employees has 200+ apps, and <a href="https://99firms.com/blog/saas-statistics/">spends $2844 per employee</a> on SaaS (as of 2019). Anything that helps them save money, will find a market.</p><hr><p>When it comes to B2C, the cure is easier to market than prevention. The companies that sell painkillers succeed (and experience pull) compared to companies that sell vitamins (have to push).</p><p>It is easier to sell weight loss, than it is to promote good habits, eating healthy, and exercising. When it is a good thing, its called habit (there are books and books about how to cultivate them) and it takes discipline. When it is a bad thing, it's an addiction.</p><p>The successful B2C companies all pander to one of the seven deadly sins : pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. If you take the Unicorns of the B2C world, you can almost make a 1:1 mapping with the list. </p><hr><p>Startups that are out there to change the world for the better - rather than just pander to the vices of the world do take time. Most true innovation in the B2C game, will be considered radical and will face some friction - like medicine usually does. It is an <a href="https://amzn.to/3lp52np">infinite game</a> and requires enormous staying power. If you are one of those startups, then remember that you are playing the long game, and it takes time.</p><p><strong>Related Read :</strong> <a href="https://blackbook.thestartupcentre.com/levels-of-service/">The Six levels of Service</a></p>

<hr>
<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

                    <p><br>As we're wrapping up 2020, you might be looking into some ways you can make your tax bill a little smaller.</p><p>Although many sectors were hit hard by the pandemic, many companies experienced rapid growth because of the pandemic. If you are fortunate enough to be part of the latter, here are some ways to bring forward some company expenses and decrease your tax burden.</p><p>I wrote this list from my perspective as a freelance designer/front-end developer. I suspect most of the list will apply to knowledge workers in general, but it is in no way a comprehensive list.</p><h2 id="retirement-investing">Retirement/Investing</h2><p>The first one on the list is not a company expense but rather a financial investment. Many countries allow you to invest some amount of money into investments tax-free.</p><p>In the US, these are called a 401(k) or an IRA. If you don't live in the US, check if your country of residence has an equivalent.</p><h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2><p>The first thing you should look to upgrade are your primary devices.</p><ul><li>Laptop or desktop computer</li><li>External monitor</li><li>Phone</li><li>Hard drive</li><li>Peripherals (mouse, keyboard, desk mat)</li><li>Tablet (with accessories)</li><li>Extra security devices like a Yubikey</li><li>Router or other networking equipment</li></ul><p>If you now spend most of your time on video calls, you might also want to invest in having a better setup</p><ul><li>Microphone</li><li>Green screen</li><li>Lighting panels/boxes</li><li>Sound absorption panels</li><li>Microphone (with boom arm)</li><li>DSLR camera that has a clean HDMI output so you can use it as a webcam</li><li>Elgato Stream Deck</li></ul><p>Many of us found ourselves working from home full-time this year and likely for the next year as well. If you haven't already, consider investing in an improved home office.</p><h3 id="upgrade-your-office">Upgrade your office</h3><ul><li>(Sit-stand) Desk</li><li>Ergonomic chair</li><li>Lighting</li><li>Furniture</li><li>Decoration</li><li>Speakers to play music</li></ul><h3 id="backups-or-spare-equipment">Backups or Spare Equipment</h3><p>Some of your equipment might be needing replacement soon or would hit your business very hard if it failed. For example, if your laptop breaks and it takes 1-2 weeks to repair. It would cost you a lot of money if you didn't work during that time.</p><p>You can use the cash surplus of this financial year to buy equipment in advance that you think might break down in the next 12 months or purchase extras, so your business isn't interrupted by repairs. Apple laptops of the last few years often have to be repaired, and they won't give you a backup device. A backup MacBook Air might be a lifesaver if your MBP fails, as you can continue working.</p><h2 id="education">Education</h2><p>Learning new things is essential if you want to remain relevant, and it also improves your prospects. Education often has a very high return on investment (ROI), so it's both an excellent tax deduction and an investment in yourself. Spend money on:</p><ul><li>Courses</li><li>Books</li><li>Conferences</li><li>Private mentoring or coaching</li><li>MOOCs</li><li>Certifications</li></ul><p><strong>Networking and Marketing</strong></p><p>It's not just about what you know; who you know is often just as or even more critical.</p><ul><li>Networking events</li><li>Masterminds</li><li>Conferences</li></ul><h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2><p>Chances are very high that you are using a variety of software tools in your day-to-day work.</p><ul><li>Switch to a yearly subscription; not only is that cheaper than paying monthly. It also allows you to deduct the full expense this year.</li><li>Upgrade to a higher tier</li><li>Add new tools</li></ul><h2 id="domains">Domains</h2><p>This one is mostly for IT folks as we tend to have many domains for (future) side-projects. We will definitely start on the idea someday😉.</p><p>Instead of renewing your domain every year, extend it by 2-10 years if you are sure you are unlikely to get rid of it during that time anyway.</p><p>Same as paying yearly for software subscriptions, by paying for multiple years at once, you can deduct the full amount in this tax year.</p><h2 id="insurance">Insurance</h2><p>If you had a good year financially, use that spare cash to put yourself in a better position next year. Buy insurance for the devices you use, insure yourself for income loss or liability, etc.</p><h2 id="donate-to-charities">Donate to charities</h2><p>2020 was a challenging year for many people. Some sectors like hospitality and tourism were hit exceptionally hard. If you are in the fortunate position to have to worry about decreasing your tax bill, consider doing it by giving some to a charity that is close to your heart.</p><p>Many countries allow you to deduct charitable donations from your taxes. Check your local tax law to see which organizations are eligible or if there are other requirements your donation must meet.</p><h2 id="gifts-and-bonuses">Gifts and Bonuses</h2><p>If you have employees or work with contractors who contributed to your success this year, consider giving them something extra. A cash bonus or some other way to show your appreciation.</p><h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2><p>If you don't have an office but commute or regularly travel to clients. A new car or (electric) bike are also deductable if you use them for work. You can buy or lease a new car or invest in a new (electric) bicycle to make your commute more comfortable next year. </p><p>Many governments have extra tax breaks in place to promote electric transportation. Make sure to check your local tax laws to check if there are extra benefits you can receive.</p><h2 id="pay-smartly">Pay smartly</h2><p>This one doesn't decrease your tax bill but allows you to get that little extra from the money you do spend.</p><p>If you are spending money anyway, try to use credit cards with good rewards or cashback programs.</p><p>For example, the Apple Card gives you 3% cashback on the money you spent at Apple. That's an easy way to save 50-100 bucks if you plan on buying a new MacBook Pro anyway.</p><p>You can also use a credit card with a good point reward program like American Express. These points are easily converted to airline programs so you can do something fun in the future, like a free upgrade to business class on your next flight. If you don't have an American Express card already, you can sign up for one with <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/business-expenses/www.americanexpress.nl/introduceren/jORNjVChBp?CPID=100333781">my friend-link</a>, and you will receive extra points. </p><p>Check the terms first as they usually require you to spend X amount within three months to receive the points. If you plan on spending that already for your business, it's an easy way to get extra points.</p><h2 id="that-s-a-wrap">That's a Wrap</h2><p>That's all. What are some business purchases you've made this year that are a great investment? Send me a tweet or email, and I'll add them to the list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><section id="primary"><main id="main"><article id="post-153"><div><p>The ability facilitate collaborative meetings is a critical skill for leaders. When done well, the facilitator creates an engaging discussion that has high attendance and prevents boredom. Most importantly, it creates an advantage for the team by aligning the group on the meeting’s topics.&nbsp;</p><p>Accomplishing these goals with consistency as a facilitator takes time. Each discussion will put your decision making, time management, and leadership skills to the test.</p><p>You will mess up at times, but the experience will provide important skills. I’ve been doing this for years, and I still screw up. I recently forgot to introduce the leading questions for a large retrospective discussion! We lost a ton of time from this mistake.</p><p>The purpose of&nbsp; this post is to teach you six methods of facilitation I’ve learned over the years.&nbsp; I’ll also throw in a story or two where I’ve completely screwed everything up so you can avoid my mistakes.</p><h2>Method 1: Prepare for the Meeting</h2><p>Meetings have the stereotype of being a boring waste of time. Your goal as the facilitator is to make the discussion worthwhile for people to attend. To achieve this, you need to prepare.</p><h3>How I Learned the Importance of Preparing for Collaborative Meetings</h3><p>At my first job, I gave a presentation to college students about my career path as a software engineer. I enjoy giving presentations, but I didn’t practice the story I would tell. It wasn’t a big deal – I knew the main details from telling friends. I didn’t even need to make a slide deck!</p><p>Fast forward to the day of the presentation. I walk up to the podium and start talking. What do you think happened?</p><p>I bombed the entire story.</p><p>I still knew the main beats of it, but without practice, I didn’t know how to connect them. I froze to think of the right words. Whenever I looked into the crowd, I saw…</p><p>Blank stares.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>After five agonizing minutes, I finished and went back to my seat. No questions, zero engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>I walked away from that day with an important lesson around public speaking. Regardless of whether I’m giving a presentation or facilitating a meeting, the same lesson applies:</p><p>Always prepare.</p><p>Being prepared provides clarity on how to engage with the audience. It gives you confidence in how to guide the group. You will know your stuff and everyone will see that.</p><h3>How I Prepare for Collaborative Meetings</h3><p>The first step towards preparation is understanding the goal of the meeting. The common goals I’ve seen are:</p><ul><li>Making a decision</li><li>Gathering feedback</li><li>Sharing information</li><li>Group collaboration and interaction</li></ul><p>Depending on the goal, the content will vary.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s look at a meeting where a group makes a decision. For this discussion, you will have to outline the questions to answer, acquire contextual information, and figure out who should attend.&nbsp;</p><p>For a discussion focused on gathering feedback, the goal is different. Your goal is to get attendees to talk and share information. You can do this with an activity that gets people talking to one another. You could also provide a list of questions for the group to answer over the session.</p><p>Once you understand the goal of the meeting, you can use the following checklist of questions to prepare:</p><ul><li>What do I want the group to walk away thinking about?</li><li>What will the agenda be?</li><li>Which questions need to be answered by the end of the discussion?</li><li>How much time should I give each topic?</li><li>How will I get attendees engaged with the content?</li><li>Who needs to attend the discussion?</li></ul><p>With preparation, you will facilitate meetings with confidence.</p><h2>Method 2: Find a Note-Taker for the Discussion</h2><p>Recording the notes of a meeting is important for our future selves. They provide important context. Sure, some people will miss the meeting and use the notes to catch up. In my experience, the real value comes when you need to refer to the notes a year from now.</p><p>Meeting notes provide more than the details of the conversation. They capture <em>why </em>specific decisions are made.</p><p>Considering the value of meeting notes, you may think that it’s your job as the facilitator to write them down.</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>Facilitating a meeting demands your full attention. You need to focus on sticking to the agenda and guide the discussion.&nbsp;</p><p>Having to record the meeting notes prevents you from doing all those tasks well. You’ll be too busy keeping up with what everyone is saying.&nbsp;</p><p>You should be focusing on how to guide the discussion.</p><p>In order to focus on creating collaborative meetings, an important method of facilitation is to find someone else to record the meeting notes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rotate Who Records Meeting Notes</h3><p>Don’t have the same person take your meetings’ notes. The job comes with the cost of not being fully present in the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, this role often gets delegated to the women on the team. This is because we have been socialized to associate “supportive” work with women.&nbsp;</p><p>To create an inclusive environment, rotate the role of the scribe to different people. This will allow everyone to equally contribute to your discussions.</p> <h2>Method 3: Manage the Time to Prevent Boredom</h2><h3>How I Failed Managing Time as a Meeting Facilitator</h3><p>Earlier this year, I was facilitating an org-wide meeting of forty engineers. We had a bunch of topics to work through within an hour, so time management was critical.&nbsp;</p><p>During the meeting, everything was going great! Good questions from the audience, we presenters sticking to the time, and I had a great note-taker.</p><p>Then we got to the open discussion topic.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew this topic was going to take a lot of time, and I reserved twenty minutes for it. The presenter was handling questions with ease, and nothing was surprising us. People were staying engaged, but we weren’t coming to a decision.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I decided to have this conversation take over the rest of the meeting. This meant bumping the last topic off the agenda.&nbsp;</p><p>I made the wrong choice.</p><p>While the discussion worked out fine, the presenter of the topic I removed wasn’t happy. I could tell he spent a lot of time on his slides to make sure people understood the work his team was producing.&nbsp;</p><p>This peer of mine deserved the space to celebrate the progress his team was making. I instead allowed the larger group to talk in circles.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time I allowed a topic to go past its time. I’ve done it a bunch in retrospective meetings. It was the first time where I saw the negative impact of disrespecting the schedule of a meeting.</p><h3>How You Can Effectively Manage Time in a Meeting</h3><p>Time management is one of the methods of facilitation to focus on. It’s also one of the most difficult tasks to oversee.&nbsp;</p><p>To effectively manage time, you will need to cut people off. This feels so rude. It feels like you’re not creating a collaborative meeting whenever you do it.</p><p>You must overcome this feeling.</p><p>To get past this internal hurdle, remember two things:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The goal of the meeting</li><li>Your job as the facilitator</li></ul><p>Understanding the meeting’s goal will provide the resolve needed to interrupt others. If you want the discussion to achieve the goal of the meeting, it’s up to you to ensure that happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding your job as the facilitator, your <strong>primary </strong>role in the meeting is to move the discussion forward. It is <strong>not </strong>to take part in the conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>No one cares about the goal of the meeting as much as you do. No one else is paying attention to the clock as much as you. It’s your job to make the time productive for everyone.</p><p>Getting over this feeling will be hard at first. I hope that remembering your goal and job will give you the resolve you need. People will respect you for respecting their time.</p><h2>Method 4: Create an Inclusive Space for ALL Voices in the Room</h2><p>Have you ever been in a meeting where someone said nothing for an hour, only to come to the group later with plenty to say?</p><p>Every time this happens to me, I always wish they spoke up sooner.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there are the people that talk to process their thoughts. They always mean well, but can often fail to listen to others.</p><p>As a facilitator, you’re going to need to figure out how to engage with these communication styles. Understanding these styles will make it easier to create collaborative meetings. Every meeting will have a mixture of extroverted and introverted communicators.</p><h3>Extroverted Communicators</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Extraversion">Extroverted communicators</a> often process information in the meeting on the fly. Their primary model of communication is “talking to think”. These people will often be the most active members of the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the meeting type, they are great additions to the group. They will get others to talk and engage. For these situations, you won’t need to do anything to get these people to engage.</p><p>In other meetings, this communication style may be a detriment. Frequent interruptions. No space is given to others to speak. A lack of listening. This is where you need to manage the situation as the facilitator.</p><p>I recommend paying attention to how everyone else in the room is responding to how the person is talking. Look for people that are failing to get their word in on the conversation. When you see this, take the step to interrupt the current speaker and create that space.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll also need to pay attention to when people interrupt others. Introverted communicators put a lot of thought into their words. It sucks if they get interrupted after a couple of words. Pay the most attention to this group in a meeting. If they get interrupted, stop the interrupter, and give the space back to the original person.</p><h3>Introverted Communicators</h3><p>The “quieter”, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion">introverted</a>, communicators in the room need a different management style. I focus on making sure they come prepared for the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Introverted communicators spend a lot of their mental energy in deep thought. They want to make sure they have a full understanding of a topic before responding.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why they are often quiet in meetings – they are processing the information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They want their words to be meaningful and clear when they speak.</p><p>To support this communication type, share preparation materials before the meeting. This will provide others time to …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I am currently working on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin_rover">Rosalind Franklin rover</a>, part of the Exomars 2022 mission to Mars.
I develop a software layer to integrate the autonomous navigation algorithms (developed by CNES) with the hardware rover (built by Airbus).
CNES has been working on image processing algorithms to give some autonomy to robots.
Their expertise is being used, among other projects, in Exomars.
Airbus is developing the actual rover, and has defined some APIs to be exposed to allow executing CNES’s algorithms.</p>

<p>The real hardware which will fly is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEON">LEON2-FT</a>, a radiation-tolerant Sparc based CPU.
Testing on this hardware is very slow (software must first be uploaded, and the CPU is clocked at 80 MHz).
In order to speed up development, the software is first tested on a standard x86 computer, to validate the algorithms and iron out most bugs, and later run on Sparc for validation.</p>

<p>There are a few differences, which require some work on Sparc.
Most issues I encountered until now are due two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">Endianness</a>: x86 is litle-endian while Sparc is big-endian. This requires some care when sending input or reading output data.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">Memory alignment</a>: Sparc requires reading <code>int</code>s from addresses which are a multiple of 4, and <code>double</code>s from multiple of 8. x86 does not. Therefore, the same code can work on x86 but raise a trap on Sparc. This can happen when using <code>__attribute__((packed))</code> on <code>struct</code>s.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failing test</strong></p>

<p>One of my tests was returning a different result on x86 vs Sparc: <code>0xBF FD 67 34  50 FF A7 AE</code> and <code>0xBF FD 67 34  50 FF A7 AD</code>.
The difference is subtle: the last byte is <code>0xE</code> vs <code>0xD</code>.
These bytes are to be interpreted as <code>double</code>s, which gives: -1.8376963771829468 and -1.8376963771829466.
Again, the difference is small: it is in the order of 10**-16.</p>

<p>I could have justified this small difference in the test report, tell my boss I had fixed another test and call it a day.
But that would have required updating the test runner to check floats up to a given precision, which would have added some complexity.
Moreover, a few things bothered me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The input data is exactly the same (of course)</li>
<li>This part of the algorithm contains few operations and no loops, so an error accumulation over hundreds of loops does not look like a good explanation</li>
<li>The difference is not exactly one <em>byte</em>, but actually the <em>least significant <strong>bit</strong></em>. It means that the difference is the smallest possible difference we could have between two <code>double</code>s. Coincidence? I don’t know yet, but that is pretty weird.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s investigate this together.</p>



<h2 id="locating-the-bug">Locating the bug</h2>

<p>When debugging, the first step is to reproduce the bug to be able to study it.
In my case, it was pretty easy: I already had a test, and it was completely deterministic: the bug happened 100% of the time.</p>

<p>From the failed test report, I followed the function calls passing this value until the place where it was computed, sprinkling <code>printf</code>s along the way.
I quickly located the exact line, and checked the inputs and outputs: the error happened when converting a value from degrees to radians.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing a minimal reproducible example</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> is useful to be able to reproduce and play with the bug, with the least amount of code possible.
This allow testing several hypothesis with fast feedback loops.</p>

<p>Here is the code I came up with, to reproduce the issue.
I was suspecting that the order of the operations <code>*</code>/<code>/</code> could be the root cause, so I included both ways.</p>
<div><div>

<p>Compiled with:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -m32 -O0 main.c -o a.out.gcc
sparc-rtems-gcc -m32 -O0 main.c -o a.out.sparc
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>1
</span><span>2

rad1 -1.83769637718294687190
rad2 -1.83769637718294664985</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, it appears that the order is indeed important, and that the issue can be fixed easily.</p>

<p>Counter intuitively, you have more precision when you first divide then multiply.
The reason is because floats have a fixed precision (fixed-size mantissa), shared between the integer and decimal parts.
So you want small numbers (divide first) to keep as much precision as possible in the decimal part.</p>

<p>Now that I had found a difference, I wanted to understand the reason.
So I tried to look under the hood.</p>

<h2 id="suspecting-the-generated-asm">Suspecting the generated ASM</h2>

<p>Since the C code shown previously gives different results, I suspected the lower level: ASM.
Maybe the order or types of instructions used could have an impact.
So I disassembled and studied the assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Disassembly</strong></p>

<p>The project is compiled as 32 bits.
To improve ease of debugging, I added <code>-O0</code> to disable optimizations.
The Sparc version is compiled with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTEMS">RTEMS</a>’s (real-time operating system) toolchain.</p>

<p>To disassemble, I used the following command:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">objdump -d -M intel -m i386 a.out.gcc-default
sparc-rtems-objdump -d -M intel -m sparc a.out.sparc</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the dump shown below, I have shortened the ASM to keep only the relevant part.
If you’re trying to follow along, here are some manuals: <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/">x86</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/816-1681/6m83631kf/index.html">Sparc</a>.</p>

<p><strong>x86</strong></p>

<p>I assume you know a bit of x86 assembly, but just in case, here is a quick ref to refresh your memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>fdivrp: FPU division</li>
<li>fld: FPU load</li>
<li>fmulp: FPU multiplication</li>
<li>fstp: FPU store</li>

<p><strong>Sparc</strong></p>

<p>You might have some knowledge of x86 or ARM assembly, but Sparc is less common, and has some major differences.
Here is a crash course on Sparc assembly to get you up to speed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each <code>call</code> is followed by a <code>nop</code>. This is because of Sparc’s multi-stages instructions decoding/execution pipeline: when the <code>call</code> instruction is executed, the next instruction is already loaded and will be executed. A <code>nop</code> is used to avoid executing something that should not be.</li>
<li>Loads from memory are made with three instructions. This is due to the instructions having a fixed size of 4 bytes (you’ll notice that x86 has variable-size instructions). That is why the instructions can not have a 32 bits value and several of them are needed to load it: first <code>sethi</code> (sets the 22 high bits), followed by an <code>or</code> (sets the low 10 bits).</li>
<li>The register system is a bit complex. You can have a look at <a href="http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/people/loechner/public_html/enseignement/SPARC/sparcstack.html">this</a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19620-01/805-4436/z40003aa172a/index.html">that</a> if you’re curious. Just note that there are different categories of registers: <code>global</code> (<code>g0</code> to <code>g7</code>), <code>out</code> (<code>o0</code> to <code>o7</code>) and floating point (<code>f0</code> to <code>f31</code>) (and a few other ones that we won’t need here).</li>

<hr>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you want to make ascii art the first thing you should know is that
you don't need a special program, or special skills to make it
with. All you need is somewhere to type text into - your e-mail
program, notepad, wordpad, that sort of thing - and an idea of what
you want to draw. There are no secrets or rules other than the
following:

</p><ol>
  <li> Use a non-proportional or fixed width font. Click <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~klr/fonts.html">HERE</a> for a
          page on this site that will tell you what they are, or ask
          me for the text version of the page via e-mail.

  </li><li> Don't use tabs!! Always, but always use the space bar (or your
 cursor keys/mouse if the program you're typing in supports that) for
 empty spaces. The reason for this is that different computers and
 programs interperet the size of a tab space differently, so although
 what you see on your screen looks fine, on someone else's your pic
 may look all split up.

 </li><li> Only use the keyboard characters on an American standard
 keyboard. That means all the letters, numbers and punctuation that
 you can see printed on the keyboard keys. You can use the shift key,
 but don't use the alt key to make characters. The reason for this is
 similar to that for not using tabs - different computers interperet
 alternative characters in different ways. The idea behind ascii is
 that all computers can read it because it's made up of characters
 that all computers will recognise.

 </li><li> Don't leave empty spaces at the end of each line. Make sure every
 line that you type ends on the last character, and not a few spaces
 after it. This can cause problems on other systems, with line
 wrapping and so on.
</li></ol>

<h2>Your First Ascii</h2>

<p>The best way to make a start is to take someone else's picture and see
if you can copy it. That way you get a feel for how you can use
different characters. We'll start easy. Try copying these shapes,
which only use the characters:

</p><pre> / \  |  _ 
 ___               ___
|   |      /\     /   \
|___|     /__\    \___/
</pre>

<p>Easy huh? Now try making the same shapes again using the characters: 

</p><pre>-  "  .  ,  `  :  &gt;  &lt;
</pre>

<p>This is what I came up with: 

</p><pre> .---.       .        .--.
 :   :     .' `.     &lt;    &gt;
 "---"     "---"      `--'
</pre>

<p>Bit more tricky, and it doesn't look as neat, but some of these
characters, and knowing how you can use them can come in very handy at
times, which we'll see later. Have a go at copying these, just for
practice. Change them if you like:
</p><pre> _   _    __    _   _                                   .^._    __
| |_| |_.'  `._| |_| |    /\  /\  /\  /\       /\      /   \|   \ \
|  _   _      _   _  |   /  \/  \/  \/  \    .'  `.   /_____V   / /
|_| |_| `.__.' |_| |_|  / /\  /\  /\  /\ \  &lt;      &gt;  |[]_[]|   \ \
                        \/  \/  \/  \/  \/   `.  .'   | |+| |   / /
                                               \/     `"""""'   \_\</pre>

<h2>Curves</h2>

<p>It's handy to know where the characters 'sit' on each line. Are they
at the top, in the middle or on the bottom of the line? A couple of
ascii characters vary in their position from computer to computer, but
mostly they all sit in the same place. Have a go yourself on your
keyboard. Here are some examples.

</p><pre>Top of line:            " ` '
Top or middle of line:  ^ * ~ =
Middle of line:         - +
Bottom of line:         _ . ,
</pre>

<p>You can use all these characters on one line to make a pattern, like
these:

</p><pre>_.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._.,-=~+"^'`*`'^"+~=-,._


"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"^`'*-=~+,._.,+~=-*'`^"
</pre>
<p>Now try making a simple sig with a decorative border, using all the
characters we've met so far. This is what I came up with:
</p><pre>                        _________________________
  ..,,++~~--==**''``^^""  Hayley Jane wakenshaw  ""^^``''**==--~~++,,..
 /|\                     flump@quadrant.xs4all.nl                    /|\
&lt; : &gt; Flump's Fantastic Ascii Collection  http://www.xs4all.nl/~klr &lt; : &gt;
 \|/ "Daddy.. why doesn't the magnet pick up your floppy disks?..."  \|/
  ""^^''``**--==~~++,,.._________________________..,,++~~==--**``''^^""
</pre>

<h2>Using The Other Characters</h2>

<p>The other ascii characters fall into three categories. Either they're
the full height of the line or they're half height. Capitals and
numbers are always full height. Compare them to some of the others -
which are half height, and which are full height? Some examples:

</p><pre>Full height: A 7 % @ ! # ) ; &amp; $ ] } | / &gt; l t f k h d ?
Half height: a o v z
</pre>

<p>And then there's the 3rd sort. The characters that look like half
height, but sit a little lower on the line, like they would in
handwriting. These are: j g y p q

</p><p>And all together they can make a slight curve, just like the others:
</p><pre>pqyjgacoevA8!@)lf$%;$fl(@!8AveocagjypqacoevA8!@)lf$%;$fl(@!8Aveoc
</pre>

<h2>Lines and Diagonals</h2>

<p>There are three basic lines to any picture - straight (either
horizontally, or vertically), diagonal, and the third is the curve,
which includes circles. We'll look at straight and diagonal lines
first. Horizontal and vertical lines are simple in ascii - here are
some examples:
</p><pre>Horizontal: 8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
            """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
            ----------------------------------------------------------
            __________________________________________________________
            ..........................................................


Vertical:   |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
            |    8    :    !    1    I
</pre>
<p>Diagonals are a bit more tricky. You can make simple ones using the /
and \ keys. Diagonals with other gradients need a technique similar to
that used to make slight curves. Experiment yourself to see how you
can make different angles. Here are some examples to start you off:

</p><pre>       /         .'               _,-'                            __
      /        .'             _,-'                        __..--''
     /       .'           _,-'                      __..''
    /      .'         _,-'                  __..--''
   /     .'       _,-'              __..--''
  /    .'     _,-'          __..--''                   ____....----"""
 /   .'   _,-'      __..--''           ____....----""""
/  .'  ,-'  __..--''   ____....----""""
</pre>



<h2>Circles</h2>

<p>By now we've looked at the basic characters, character height, slight
curves, lines, and slopes. The last thing to look at is what many
people who make ascii have trouble with: circles. You're half way
there already, though, because ascii circles are basically a mix of
vertical and horizontal lines, slopes or diagonals, and curves. After
a little practice, you'll get a feel for making different sized
circles - I have a basic set of circles in a file that I refer to when
I need a circular or rounded shape in an ascii pic, so now I can make
them easily in all sorts of sizes. Start making small circles - how
many ways can you think of to make a circle in under 5 lines? The
bigger the circle the more rounded it can be, but try making circles
of different sizes and see what you come up with. These are mine:
</p><pre>                                               __
                          _   /""\            /  \
1 line:  O ()   2 lines: (_)  \__/   3 lines: \__/

                                                     ____
           ___               .-''-.                .'    `.
4 lines:  /   \   5 lines:  /      \   6 lines:   /        \
         |     |           |        |             |        |
          \___/             \      /              \        /
                             `-..-'                `.____.'

             _.-""""-._
9 lines:   .'          `.
          /              \
         |                |
         |                |
         |                |
          \              /
           `._        _.'
              `-....-'
</pre>

<p>That's the basic characters, and what you can do with them. Play with
them, see what patterns and ascii scribbles you can make. Have a go at
taking one of my pics, or another ascii pic from some of the excellent
sites around, and copy it. Then change it! See how you can use the
characters to make the picture look different. Can you make the
expression on a face change? Can you make an ascii person fatter,
thinner, taller, shorter? Give Barney the dinosaur a moustache, or,
much better, multiple wounds?  :-) This is how I learned. Many of my
first efforts were absolutely dreadful. So I looked at how someone
else had made the same sort of picture and learned from it. And I
still do - probably why people often say my style is very similar to
Joan Stark's!

</p><p>To get you started, cut and paste this head into wherever you want to
draw your ascii, and give it a face. Add a hat or a body. Or make the
hair shorter or longer. Make it a clown or a devil!

</p><pre>           ,-.,~~.
         ,'///||\\`.
        ///(((||)))\\.
       (((         )))
       _)))        |(_
      ._//\       /\\_.
      `-'_/`-._.-'\-`-'
        ' \/=._.=\/ hjw
</pre>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>That's all the boring stuff about technique over. :-) What's coming up
is a step by step demo of how I go about turning a picture into ascii.

</p><p>When you first start, it's always a good idea to try to draw something
simple. Gromit the dog is made up of very simple shapes - just ovals
and circles, so I'll use him as an example.



</p><p>To start a picture, I look for the simplest or most prominent feature
of whatever I'm trying to draw. In Gromit's case, I reckon it's his
nose. :-) I'll try the 2 line circle and see where that takes
me. After I've drawn his nose I'll see if I can draw the shape of his
head around it:
</p><pre>               ___
              /   \
             |     |
            /   _   \
            |  (_)  |
             \     /
              `---'
</pre>

<p>Hmm.. don't like that - the top of his head isn't tall enough, but if
I make it any longer it looks too …</p></div>

	        <p>The Impossible List is a list of goals when people read would advise you to stop flying in the air and stay ground. It is not a <a href="https://harshamv.com/the-bucket-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bucket list</a> but an evolving list of things you want to achieve as you strike off the old ones. The list gets bigger &amp; bigger with time. It is focused on how I want to live my life &amp; documents the journey as and when an action has been taken.</p>
<p>I discovered the concept from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apcEae2U4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Frank’s</a> video, which was inspired by Joel Runyon who is the author of it.

			<main id="main" role="main">

<article id="post-141">

	

	<div>
		
<p><a href="https://develytica.com/">Develytica</a> backbone is integration with GitHub. It means that our users will log in with their GitHub accounts and all out offerings are based on GitHub data. That means we need to sync all the data that we need from GitHub and update every now and then aswell.</p>



<p>This is how our syncing engine works at this moment. Probably in the future when the loads are growing things needs to be replaced and reworked. But for now, it works.</p>



<p>First little bit about tech. Develytica is built with Go and is using Postgres as database. The front-end is built with Go html templates so there is not much other technology then Go and Postgres.</p>



<div><p>So how does the syncing work?</p><p>There is one go module which is called SyncService that is responsible for syncing all the necessery data.</p></div>



<p>SynceService exposes the following methods:<br></p>



<pre><code>//CreateSyncJobs creates needed syncs for the user
func CreateSyncJobs(tenantID uint)

//DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID will start full sync cycle
func DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID(tenantID uint)

//DoFullSyncAllUsersPeriodic checks all syncs that needs to
// be synced in some period
func DoFullSyncAllUsersPeriodic()

//ScanAndDoSyncs will check every 5 seconds if there are some
// syncs that must be completed
func ScanAndDoSyncs()</code></pre>



<p><br>Also there is table called “sync” which has the following definition:</p>



<pre><code>type Sync struct {
	gorm.Model
	TenantID       uint   `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	Name           string `gorm:"primaryKey"`
	LastRunSuccess bool   `gorm:"default:false"`
	LastRun        time.Time
	Priority       int `gorm:"index"`
	InProgress     bool
}</code></pre>



<div><p>So what happens when users registers with their Github account is the following:</p><p>1. We provision them a new user and create a new tenant for them so that in the future they can add more user</p></div>



<p>2. We will call <code>CreateSyncJobs</code> and <code>go DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID</code></p>



<p>We call <code>DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID </code>with go keyword since we don’t want it to block the sign-in flow and go keyword will fire a new go worker.</p>



<p>That’s it. We have now user user provision and first initial data sync with github is either finished or still in progress.</p>



<p>The code <code>DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID </code>for is the following:<br></p>



<pre><code>// DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID will start full sync cycle
func DoImmidiateFullSyncByTenantID(tenantID uint) {
	syncs := []models.Sync{}
	db := utils.DbConnection()

	result := db.Order("priority asc").Where("tenant_id = ?", tenantID).Find(&amp;syncs)

	if result.RowsAffected &gt; 0 {
		for _, sync := range syncs {
			if isSyncInProgress(sync) {
				continue
			}
			updateSyncInProgress(&amp;sync)
			syncGithubData(sync.TenantID, sync.Name, sync.ID)
			defer updateSyncInProgress(&amp;sync)
		}
	}
}</code></pre>



<p>The function will get all the tenants syncs we have saved, marks it as in progress and when executes it.</p>



<div><p>However normally we would like to sync all the data in some period. For example every 2 hours.</p><p>Here comes handy the <code>DoFullSyncAllUsersPeriodic</code> function which has the following logic:</p></div>



<pre><code>func DoFullSyncAllUsersPeriodic() {
	syncs := []models.Sync{}
	syncEveryHour, err := strconv.ParseInt(os.Getenv("SYNC_EVERY_HOUR"), 10, 64)
	var DEFAULT_SYNC_EVERY_HOUR = int64(2)

	if err != nil {
		syncEveryHour = DEFAULT_SYNC_EVERY_HOUR
	}

	syncInterval := time.Duration(syncEveryHour) * time.Hour
	syncDateNeeded := time.Now().Add(-syncInterval)
	db := utils.DbConnection()

	result := db.Order("priority asc").Where("last_run &lt; ?", syncDateNeeded).Find(&amp;syncs)

	//all syncs that needs new sync
	if result.RowsAffected &gt; 0 {
		for _, sync := range syncs {
			if isSyncInProgress(sync) {
				continue
			}
			updateSyncInProgress(&amp;sync)
			syncGithubData(sync.TenantID, sync.Name, sync.ID)
			defer updateSyncInProgress(&amp;sync)
		}
	}
}</code></pre>



<p>Here we will calculate the syncDateNeeded and will only check the syncs in the syncs table where the last_run date is less then the calculated syncDateNeeded.</p>



<p>Also running the period job is as simple as calling the function every 5 seconds with <code>ScanAndDoSyncs</code></p>



<pre><code>func ScanAndDoSyncs() {
	for {
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
		go DoFullSyncAllUsersPeriodic()
	}
}</code></pre>



<p>As I wrote in the beginning this solution is simple and is working for us now. Probably in the future the syncs need to be queued and Redis or something similar must be introduced. </p>



<p>But right now using simple go workers and postgres is good enough.</p>

<div id="articleBody1177549878">
<div data-element="articleBodyBlocks">
<p>Both parties say that Facebook has prevented new fake advertisements with De Mol by using technology. That was also De Mol’s demand. And when commercials with him do crop up again, De Mol and Facebook have now “reached agreement on a procedure to be followed.”</p>


<p>In the advertisements, De Mol supposedly called on people to invest in bitcoins. The names and images of other well-known Dutch people were also used to add strength. His son Johnny de Mol, Jort Kelder and Humberto Tan, among others, appeared in the fake advertisements. A fake article was circulated about Tan suggesting that he had started a company in bitcoins and made a huge amount of money. Facebook removed the article after Humberto complained about it on social media.</p>


<p>The bitcoin investment fraud via advertisements with celebrities has caused the victims more than 2.9 million euros in damage in the past year, the Fraud Help Desk announced at the beginning of this year. In total, more than three hundred Dutch people fell victim to this digital fraud.</p>

    <date>26 November 2020</date>
      <p>Prompted by some discussions at work, I recently read <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-building-leaders-by-breaking-the-rules/9780241250945">Turn the Ship Around!</a> I enjoyed it. Here are my notes.</p>

<h2 id="making-followers-into-leaders-in-the-navy">Making followers into leaders in the Navy</h2>

<p>I had previously seen a talk about the concepts by the author, L. David Marquet. Recently, one of my team shared a link to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q">short video (10 min)</a> when we were having a discussion about how to take more ownership, and I thought I would read the book to get the practical steps.</p>

<p>The context is fascinating, because being a leader at all levels rather than following orders, is expressly something I do not associate with the military.</p>

<p>The book is essentially a case study of what L. David Marquet and his team aboard a nuclear submarine did to move from a “leader-follower” approach to a “leader-leader” approach.</p>

<p>Each chapter illustrates an idea with an example, which makes it very easy to read, and then supplements it with questions you can use to think about how this idea could work in your own organisation. I always find it much more powerful when a business book is written by someone who actually has the experience of implementing the ideas they write about (like <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/high-output-management.html">High Output Management</a>, my favourite).</p>

<h2 id="the-goal-was-leadership-at-all-levels">The goal was leadership at all levels</h2>

<p>The end result was a submarine where each crew member took responsibility for their own area. Instead of the Captain making decisions, crew members would come to him and say “Captain, I intend to…” and he would say “very well”.</p>

<p>And this was just the decisions he needed to know about. 95% of the decisions on board were taken without his input.</p>

<p>The fact that they had leadership at all levels also meant they were more resilient. They had a wide pool of talent. He gives an example of wanting to let two senior people have extended leave for personal reasons at the same time, which he was able to do because there were others able to do those roles.</p>

<h2 id="he-didnt-know-the-ship-so-had-to-be-curious-rather-than-rote-questioning">He didn’t know the ship, so had to be curious (rather than rote questioning)</h2>

<p>He was in an interesting position in that he had trained for a different type of submarine, so when he joined this post he was not as technically competent as he was used to being (and ask the Navy traditionally expect leadership to be).</p>

<p>This meant when he asked the crew questions about the equipment it wasn’t to test them on their knowledge but because he genuinely did not know. Eventually he became fully technically competent on the ship but by then the patterns of interaction had been set.</p>

<p>He talked about his own struggles with wanting to be the smartest person in the room, and I found this very insightful; one of the challenges with a “leader-leader” approach is having to let go of your idea of yourself as someone who has all the answers, and this can be very hard.</p>

<p>I liked this, because it ties into my experience joining as Technical Director of a product that I didn’t build, so could not hope to be anywhere near as technically competent with as the people who built it and work on it every day.</p>

<p>One of the questions he poses at the end of the section on this is “Is technical competence personal or organisational?”</p>

<h2 id="he-met-each-member-of-the-crew-and-asked-them-some-questions">He met each member of the crew and asked them some questions</h2>

<p>One of the first things he did when taking command of the submarine was meet with each crew member and ask them a set of questions very similar to <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/meeting-everyone.html">the ones I asked my team when I joined</a>. (One question I might add for next time is “What is the best thing I can do for you?”)</p>

<p>I found that very interesting, because that idea was recommended to me by a previous mentor; he had been recommended it by a mentor of his, who was a Rear Admiral in the Navy, so I wonder if there was a direct connection here!</p>

<h2 id="emancipated-not-empowered">Emancipated, not empowered</h2>

<p>He talks a lot about how “empowerment” doesn’t work. It’s the leader allowing the crew to be empowered; so it’s still “leader-follower”, which drowns out the message. Instead, he talks about “emancipation”.</p>

<p>He says he wanted to make sure his team deliberately decided to take charge. “It wouldn’t be any good if I directed them. You can’t invoke leader-follower rules to direct a shift from leader-follower to leader-leader.”</p>

<p>When it’s going well you no longer have the ability to empower your staff, because they are no longer relying on you for their source of power.</p>

<p>He then defines leadership as communicating people’s worth and potential to people so well they are inspired to see it themselves.</p>

<h2 id="people-need-to-own-the-consequences-of-decisions-they-make">People need to own the consequences of decisions they make</h2>

<p>He started small, with each department head in charge of authorising leave. But then they weren’t in charge of the consequences, e.g. if too many people were on leave at once and there weren’t enough people to cover the watch. So then each department head was in charge of leave and the watch rota; i.e. the consequences of their decisions.</p>

<p>This became: each department head monitors their own departments and are responsible for getting the work done. (This works well when there are clear domains; one challenge we have on our team is that we share responsibility for a large domain rather than being able to split it clearly by area. This is something we’ll have to figure out.)</p>

<p>He requires each department head – and eventually, each crew member –&nbsp;to own both problems and the solutions to them.</p>

<p>Delegating authority in this way means always leaving room to question orders, and also people being able to tell him he is wrong. He recounts a story of when an officer much junior to him tells him, in response to an order, “No, Captain, you’re wrong.” The junior officer was correct, and had they instead followed the Captain’s orders, they would not have achieved their mission.</p>

<h2 id="i-intend-to">I intend to…</h2>

<p>Initially, they would come to him and say “I intend to…” and he would ask questions, for example, have you considered this safety aspect. Then he started asking them what he was thinking. Ultimately, instead of him asking questions, his crew would give enough information so that he just needs to assent.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you need to think like your boss to understand what questions they may have. He says on his submarine, they had no need of leadership development programmes – the way they ran the ship <em>was</em> a leadership development programme.</p>

<p>While reading this I wondered how we could apply it. My <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/delegating-to-a-team.html">aim is to have the principal engineers on my team running the team without me</a>, so something like this would be good. One of the challenges is that the tasks are much larger or longer-lived: it’s not “I intend to submerge the ship”, it’s more like “I intend to spend three weeks working on a proposal for how to make our content stores more consistent and cost-effective” and so would have to involve information about why that was a priority compared to other tasks.</p>

<p>It also made me think about the importance of clarity around what done looks like. In the first case, ‘done’ is the ship is safely suberged. What is ‘done’ in the second case? A case study? A recommendation? The actual work – consistency among our content stores?</p>

<p>However we do it, this proactive communication is really valuable. Rather than the leader holding all the threads and chasing for updates, each person owns the thread and proactively communicates the progress and goals.</p>



<p>He suggests thinking specifically about what mechanisms/processes can be changed to delegate authority further. What information, context, understanding, tools do people at each level need in order to have authority?</p>

<p>He describes an exercise. Identify where excellence is created in your company, e.g. at interfaces with the customer. Figure out what decisions the people at that interface need in order to achieve excellence. Finally, understand what it would take to get those employees to be able to take those decisions. Generally, this will be technical competence, thorough understanding of the organisation’s goals, authority, and responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made.</p>

<p>I like the idea of asking people, what would you need in order to be able to make this decision rather than passing it up the chain? And then figuring out what we can change so that they have that.</p>

<p>He also asks you to think about: what do I, as a proponent of the leader-leader approach need to delegate to show I am willing to walk the talk? Good question. It reminds me of some excellent advice I got years ago on first taking on a leadership role: “Delegate everything. Far more than feels comfortable.”</p>

<h2 id="as-authority-is-delegated-learning-at-all-levels-becomes-more-important">As authority is delegated, learning at all levels becomes more important</h2>

<p>If people need to make their own decisions, they need to be technically competent in their area.</p>

<p>They created a creed –&nbsp;ultimately, it was about learning (not ‘training’, they felt that was too passive).</p>

<p>I loved this bit of their creed: <em>“Our vision of our command is a learning and competence factory. The raw materials are the new personnel reporting aboard each week, new equipment, and tactics. The product is well-qualified, experienced sailors who, upon detaching from the command, carry their competence throughout the Navy. Each of you, then, is both a product of the factory (when you learn) and a machine in the factory (when you help others learn).”</em></p>

<p>It is about learning while doing. “Instead of looking at a task as just a chore, look at it as an opportunity to learn more about the associated piece of equipment, the procedure, or if nothing else, about how to delegate or accomplish tasks.”</p>

<p>Finally, to each crew member’s question, ‘what do you expect me to do?’: “I expect you to be a better submariner each day.”</p>

<h2 id="this-revolutionised-how-they-thought-about-training-programmes">This revolutionised how they thought about training programmes</h2>

<p>Rather than passive absorbing of information, their training programme was actually an enabler that allowed them to pass decision-making authority to lower and lower levels.</p>

<p>His suggestion about how to apply this in your own organisation is to think about the sentence completion “Our company would be more effective if [level] management could make decisions about [subject].” …</p></div></div>

				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png"><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png" alt="Flow running on a Raspberry Pi 400" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

                    <p>2020 was the year I started taking the risk of super-intelligent AI seriously. I blame this on OpenAI's language model, GPT-3 which was simultaneously impressive and scary.</p><p>Some did people oversell its abilities – it isn't even close to as smart as a human being, and often fails basic tests. For example, when <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered">asked</a> 'How many eyes does a horse have?' it replied 'Four. One in the front and three in the rear.' But on the other hand it did much better than anything we've had in the past. It even managed to write a plausible-sounding <a href="https://adolos.substack.com/p/feeling-unproductive-maybe-you-should">motivational article</a> that <a href="https://liamp.substack.com/p/my-gpt-3-blog-got-26-thousand-visitors">many people thought</a> was written by a real human.</p><p>While GPT-3 won't replace human writers anytime soon, it's quite impressive and blows away existing systems like Alexa and Siri. It feels like this year we discovered something fundamental about how to represent textual knowledge, and generate novel content based on that knowledge. Project the improvements we have seen in AI over the last decade out 20 years into the future; what will 2040's models be able to do?</p><p>I think 2040's models will be a lot better than GPT-3, and at a broader range of tasks. We've made faster progress in AI than most researchers expected (GPT-3, AlphaGo, AlphaStar, image GANs). I'd expect this progress to continue, and given that investment in AI increases with each breakthrough, progress might even accelerate. My estimate would be that a general-purpose AI (AGI) rivaling human intelligence has a 50% probability of being created in the next 30 years, and 80% in the next 50 years. <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/">Predictions of AI experts on this question</a> seem to roughly match these numbers.</p><p>I'm also more pessimistic about the impact of highly-intelligent AGI on human well-being than most technologists; I suspect it has a high probability of being an existential threat to humanity, and is a greater risk than climate change, asteroid impacts, nuclear holocaust, bio-terrorism, or most other things. It's honestly the only existential risk I think about these days.</p><p>There are multiple ways things can go wrong. General-purpose AI could automate away the need for most jobs (e.g., driving), reduce the average human's influence over their government (e.g., huge mostly-automated drone armies allow authoritarian regimes to proliferate), and put our future in the hands of beings more intelligent than us.</p><p>What's more worrying is that we might not invest enough into preparing for this problem until it's too late – humans are extraordinarily bad at addressing long term threats like this. It's just too easy to keep raising the bar for what is considered intelligent (<em>"AI's can only complete with us on Chess, Go, Starcraft, not on real creative work!"</em>), invent ridiculous utopian narratives (<em>"AI would never hurt us, and automation will free up time for humans to do more creative things!"</em>), or otherwise ignore the problem until it is right in front of us (<em>"Living standards have been improving for the last ten thousand years, therefore the future must always be better than the past!"</em>).</p><p>It looks like there is a small research community (total budget probably &lt; $100M) studying this problem. My goal in 2021 is to learn from them and understand more deeply what the prospects for AGI are, and what are the ways we might align their interests with ours.</p><p>The question I'd like to be able to answer convincingly by the end of 2021 is this: <strong>How far away is human-level general-purpose artificial intelligence, and how will we align its interests with ours once it is with us?</strong></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>

</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p>So went the memes a few years ago.</p>



<p>But they said that about computers before.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I think there is a world market for about five computers.”</p><cite>IBM’s President Thomas J. Watson, early 1940s</cite></blockquote>



<p>Hell, I said that about smartphones too when I first heard of them.</p>



<p>But there are 2 good use cases for a blockchain and 1 great one I thought of myself, hear me out.</p>



<h2>An uncorruptible, un-biasable Being</h2>



<p>Governments are made of humans, so they can be put under pressure by, let’s say, rich groups of companies. Just like humans, they usually cave in under pressure.</p>



<p>But Bitcoin doesn’t cave in. It doesn’t say “whoops election day is coming up so let’s approve a bailout/stimulus package (aka print more money)”. It doesn’t even need money – it’s its own money! It only needs people agreeing to participate in it.</p>



<p>Well, okay, both Bitcoin and governments print their own money. The only difference is that Bitcoin’s printing is determined by the program that says there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin, while governments’ printing is determined by humans.</p>



<p>But wait a minute, you say. Humans wrote the program, so how is it going to be any better?</p>



<p>Well, let’s say you want to change the rules to benefit you. Which is harder – convincing everybody who’s already running the Bitcoin software to run your new economic policy Bitcoin, or convincing a few government officials to push your policy?</p>



<p>I thought so.</p>



<h2>Distributing power even more than the current stock market allows</h2>



<p>I have news for you. None of these startups with their friendly pastel coloured ad campaigns and sans-serif fonts are on your side.</p>



<p>Think of how Uber is organized. At the top you have C-level executives (who own a large part of company stock), and then somewhere below them the programmers (who mostly don’t own any stock), and finally, at the very bottom, the Uber drivers (who most definitely don’t have any stock).</p>



<p>The Uber drivers have to do what the executives want them to do. They don’t have a choice, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/07/uber-drivers-feel-poor-powerless-ipo-looms">they suffer</a> as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/5/16777536/uber-travis-kalanick-recruit-drivers-tipping">a result</a> . After all, they’re not stockholders.</p>



<p>But what if in order to have anything to do with Uber, you had to own stock, even a tiny minuscule bit, and that stock came with voting rights? At the very least, drivers would have a way to push back instead of just leaving.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, Ethereum, any of these cryptocurrency tokens are just like a stock – except you don’t have to ask your bank to handle them for you. You can deal with them yourself by going to a website and buying them. That’s the key: it makes owning the token more direct and thereby distributes ownership/power amongst more people.</p>



<h2>Escape a bad economy</h2>



<p>I’m the most proud of this one, because I thought of it myself.</p>



<p>Think of a healthy, smart, hardworking person in a poor country (let’s call him George). No matter how healthy, smart, or hardworking he is, he’s still poor compared to the average American/European! Why? because he has to use his country’s own currency (assuming he lives there). Maybe his country has bad politicians – but that’s not his fault and he can’t do anything about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Now what if George had his own economy, the GeorgeCoin? </p><cite>(ok it’s an economy of one person but bear with me)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>George’s country makes a bad economic decision, and overnight its currency is worth nothing, so food prices skyrocket. But GeorgeCoin’s value is still intact, because it’s separate. </p>



<p>It’s just like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9heszj/eli5_benefits_and_disadvantages_of_a_country/">owning your house vs renting it</a>.</p>



<p>This works because even if the country’s economy tanks, people still believe in George. You just need an efficient way of converting between everybody’s own Coins. </p>

    </span></p>
<p>I realised control over my time the day I graduated from University in Sheffield, UK, 2009. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>“I can’t work for a boss” was my only criterion when entering the world after education. Even at 22, I knew I couldn’t work a 9-5.</p>
<p>While my cogs turned on a solution and money was sparse, I interviewed for a job at the local college.</p>
<p>My heart wasn’t in it. The interview process irked me, the paperwork bored me and the thoughts of what my day-to-day might look like filled me with dread.</p>
<p>Luckily, I didn’t get the job. And the next week, I landed my first freelance web development client.</p>
<p>It might have looked like I had a lot of freedom—to my friends at least—back then. But it was years later that I’d come to understand true autonomy.</p>
<p>In truth, when you have things you want, bills you must pay and little savings, you’re only a smidgen freer in self-employment.</p>
<p>In the beginning, you’re grateful for whatever work you can get from whoever you can get it from. You can’t <em>really</em> choose how to bet your time; you just have the illusion of being able to.</p>
<p>When you need the work, you need to bend. It’s only as time goes by and opportunities increase that you arrive at the holy grail somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>Four years into my freelancing career, I could start to be truly choosy. Clients, projects, what days I worked, how long I worked for. I had enough demand for my services and money in the bank to start making the mirage of freedom a reality.</p>
<p>If false autonomy is the first stage of trickery for those of us who go it alone to evade, inaction induced autonomy is the second stage.</p>
<p>When you need to work less to pay your way, you have more time to bet with. And when you’re new to this surplus, you often wager it unwisely.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s law</a> states that “The amount of time that one has to perform a task is the amount of time it will take to complete the task.”</p>
<p>When you have plenty of ideas and ample time to work—as many entrepreneurs do—it’s effortless to fill your calendar with fake progress.</p>
<p>Eleven years since entering self-employment, the overriding question of 2021 isn’t which clients I work with or what days I work, but whether I work at all.</p>
<p>And having time to bet with is stifling if you let it.</p>
<h2>A Polymaths’ Curse</h2>
<p>When you’re interested in a range of domains, you pursue them all naturally. Often until the one you’re most interested in creeps ahead, the rest of the pack fall away and a career is born.</p>
<p>This is how my early years in business played out.</p>
<p>My interests centred around video game development, art and the internet. Then I concentrated on the development of WordPress websites and this is where my knowledge lay while I cut my teeth in the world.</p>
<p>But with each year came a new interest, or two, or three:</p>
<p>In my early-20s, I started reading business books to get my WordPress consultancy ahead.</p>
<p>My mid-20s saw me pursue fitness, routine and self-improvement.</p>
<p>My late-20s saw me start an eCommerce business, leading me to study copywriting, digital marketing and sales psychology.</p>
<p>My early-30s brought me into authorship, digital product creation and stock market investing.</p>
<p>The older I get, the wider my mind opens.</p>
<p>By trade, I’m a programmer who learns new things easily. It’s a blessing in business but a curse when knowing how to bet with your time once you hit the aforementioned surplus.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288370">shiny object syndrome</a> is real and not overwhelming yourself is a business skill. Choosing from the menu of options your brain serves daily is tough.</p>
<p>A few items on my brain’s à la carte at present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could I take a year off?</li>
<li>Could I write more <a href="https://tomhir.st/pfp">books</a>?</li>
<li>Could I create a video course?</li>
<li>Could I build a SaaS product?</li>
<li>Could I start an agency or two?</li>
<li>Could I teach people how to code?</li>
<li>Could I <a href="https://www.tomhirst.com/mentorship/">coach freelancers</a> more intensively?</li>
<li>Could I trade the stock market more actively?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are solid suggestions because the answer to all of these questions is “yes”.</p>
<p>When your days aren’t decided for you—or a portion of them, at least—choosing three square meals instead of snacking is tricky. Because they’re all attractive and viable options.</p>
<p>This introduces the concept of <em>Betting With Time</em>.</p>
<p>How people with specific knowledge in multiple fields and a diverse set of skills choose to prioritise their time fascinates me.</p>
<p>How does one wager their most valuable asset effectively?</p>
<h2>Your Most Valuable Asset</h2>
<p>Your most valuable asset is time.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my favourite quotes on the relationship between time and money from entrepreneur and investor, Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earn with your mind, not with your time.
 <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1206967499838803968">Naval Ravikant</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who, in early life felt that my time would never run out and in early business, sold it hourly as a freelancer; clarity on this concept took—well, what would you know—time.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to understand the compounding effects of doing something well for a long time when you haven’t done something well for a long time.</p>
<p>Then you reach the tipping point and crystallisation of this concept is achieved:</p>
<p>You have to spend time early to make more later.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Two ways to make more money in less time:</p><p>- Get faster at what you do<br>- Charge more for what you do</p><p>Both come as a byproduct of sticking around.</p><p>There's a lesson in that;</p><p>Spend time early to save more later.</p></div>— Tom Hirst (@tom_hirst) <a href="https://twitter.com/tom_hirst/status/1340628876469399553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h2>The Highest Form Of Wealth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say “I can do whatever I want today”.
 <cite><a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/authors/morgan/">Morgan Housel</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read this excerpt from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0857197681/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0857197681&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=tomhirst-21&amp;linkId=c0e3f756dc086fafe1efbb9a78aa5f4a">The Psychology of Money</a>, I felt grateful. Business has been good to me and the autonomy I’ve engineered allows me a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought about how my life would be different if I made a multi-million-pound exit from a company I own.</p>
<p>After the Lamborghini and a month in Las Vegas, it wouldn’t be much different at all:</p>
<p>Providing for my family and being of service to the world by solving interesting problems and doing things I find fun.</p>
<p>No matter how wealthy I get from this point—so long as I keep ticking over—the end-game day-to-day is pretty similar.</p>
<p>I’m wealthy already. Because I have control of my time.</p>
<p>But control brings with it conundrums:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I best provide for my family?</li>
<li>How can I best be of service to the world?</li>
<li>How can I be the most fulfilled?</li>
<li>How can I have the most fun?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What do I bet my time on?</em></p>
<h2>Deciding What To Bet On</h2>
<p>I’m not risk-averse.</p>
<p>I’m partial to a sports bet, like to run my own investment portfolio and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-kY5uUFAPX/">I pulled our new house to bits with a baby on the way</a>.</p>
<p>As an overall assured person, making decisions never came difficult to me. Because—even if I didn’t realise it at the time—many of these decisions were already made.</p>
<p>The client was taken because my mobile phone bill needed paying and I worked evenings because I wanted a holiday.</p>
<p>As I write this, I don’t need to do anything to fulfil either.</p>
<p>With greater control of your time, decisions become harder until you prioritise with care:</p>
<p>“I could work on X, Y or Z; but what <em>should</em> I would on?”</p>
<p>I’ve realised that I won’t be able to do it all and I’m becoming OK with that; not every idea is a good idea.</p>
<p>So this presents the question:</p>
<p>How does one navigate betting with their time?</p>
<p>Here are my non-negotiables:</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>My family will always come first. I refuse to play a non-active role as a father, husband, son, brother and uncle in favour of busyness for busyness’ sake.</p>
<p>The first portion of my betting budget is allocated here.</p>
<h3>Health</h3>
<p>My health relies on exercise.</p>
<p>Working out gives me clarity and allows me to take care of myself so that I can be better for those I care about.</p>
<p>I’ll always bet on exercise.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>I’ve always freelanced in a life-first fashion.</p>
<p>There’s no point in working to level-up your life—beyond a certain point—if you never take time to enjoy the life that you’re levelling-up.</p>
<p>I get a lot from the perspective offered by friends and travel in particular.</p>
<p>Things that are I enjoy will receive an allocation.</p>
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>Omitting family, health and life from your time priorities harms work time.</p>
<p>When work time is in oversupply and you love what you do, you’re susceptible to a blinkered vision of what success takes.</p>
<p>A perspective of, “I’ll get more done if I don’t take a walk/work out/go to the football game” is counter-intuitive, because each priority supports the others.</p>
<p>Sure, you might get more done in the short-term. But is it sustainable? And how’s the quality of the work you did on no sleep? How present were you eating dinner with your family?</p>
<p>That lesson has already been learned.</p>
<p>With essential time allotted, what’s non-negotiable when betting on business pursuits?</p>
<p>Here’s my working ruleset:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take risks while retaining wealth (autonomy)</li>
<li>Realise that you can’t (and don’t have to) do it all alone</li>
<li>Increase the surface area of success without overburdening yourself</li>
<li>Make it fun and consistency will come as a byproduct</li>
<li>Identify long-term opportunities with compounding benefits</li>
<li>Invest in connections with effective people</li>
</ol>
<p>While I’m prepared to gamble, I like the odds to make sense; whether that be on my football accumulators, the companies I invest in or when betting with my time.</p>
<p>And I believe these rules bring clarity when deciding what to bet on.</p>
<h2>Hedging Your Bets</h2>
<p>I write ten, sometimes twenty notes per day. Inspiration can strike at any time. Often while working on something unrelated, usually while walking my dog and sometimes in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Remembering things is hard for me. I can’t remember a three-point shopping list without cementing it in my Notes app.</p>
<p>Equally, when a business idea arrives, I have to get it out of my head if I want to remember it.</p>
<p>The upside of having many ideas is that you have them, the downside is that you’ll never have time to action them all. You need to bring an idea to market to see if it’s a <em>good</em> idea.</p>
<p>While we’ve covered how to help you decide what to bet your time on, we’ve yet to approach volume:</p>
<p>How <em>many</em> ideas should one give focus to at any one time?</p>
<p>“Niching down” is a smart play and I owe a lot of my success in <a href="https://www.tomhirst.com/">free…</a></p></div></div>

December 29, 2020 | https://blog.6aa4fd.com/post/virality/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.6aa4fd.com/post/virality/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>This paper discusses virality in the context of social media,
a feature characteristic of some of the ways it departs from earlier mass media institutions like television.
I begin by explaining why chaos alone is an insufficient concept for wrangling this state of affairs
then proceed with a more systematic and detailed view of how viral phenomena occur
as manifestations of the rapidly adapting architecture of social media platforms.
Then I discuss why this state of affairs can also not be equated with democracy,
and conclude with a brief summary of the paper.</p>
<p>While I refer to concepts hailing from philosophy’s ivory tower,
nothing in this paper should prove inaccessible to a lay reader
and I hope that anyone interested in this phenomenon
will read on, regardless of their background.</p>
<h2 id="chaos"><del>Chaos</del></h2>
<p>It is tempting to describe the sudden viral popularity
of people and media on social media platforms
as chaotic,
because it is visible in a manner both dramatic and sudden.
Over a month, a video game skyrockets in popularity,
or a video released by someone with no following on YouTube
reaches ten million views,
all with no clear reason.
Chaos might come to mind because there appears to be no rule or system
we can use to explain how it happened,
or to predict the next occurrence.</p>
<p>The troublesome thing about chaos, as Gilles Châtelet predicted, is that it disperses
into rules, chances, systems, and organizations,
like a radioactive material undergoes a half life.
In the case of the modern web, this activity of making rules out of chaos
is already done professionally under job titles like search engine optimization.</p>
<p>It is misleading to characterize virality in terms of chaos because,
much to the dismay of SEO practitioners,
the rules, the relationships between causes and effects, are constantly changing.
Finding a relationship between the phase of an element and its environment
is all well and good when that relationship is fixed,
producing consistent results to be narrowed down and induced as the evidence grows,
but when there is no consistent relationship to be found,
a trend line becomes a trend smear.</p>
<p>What Châtelet predicted for chaos was ‘self-regulation’,
a popular laissez-faire attitude of letting things fall where they may,
letting a system come about autonomously.
Social media virality is arguably democratic,
but it has never been autonomous.
Its systems have been set out by television and shopping malls,
in the techniques of advertising and mass-media before the current epoch of media.</p>
<h2 id="glass-houses">Glass Houses</h2>
<p>Jean Baudrillard,
inspired by 50s Las Vegas and the shopping malls of the 70s,
understood those spaces as characteristic of mass media and consumer culture:
glowing swirls of stimulation,
fanged vortices hungry for our attention.
In his eyes, the advertising world of postmodernity
hollowed out meaning, communication,
and structure,
pulling everything towards a bright exteriority
to capture the attention of the spectator and induce their consumption.</p>
<p>In the architectural metaphor of Las Vegas Baudrillard shows us the city
being absorbed into a glossy and chitinous exterior through advertising.
However, the shopping mall, the Vegas strip, and the newspaper
all have the feature troubling to advertising,
of having a necessary internal structure.
In more concrete terms, a great investment of money and labor
is needed to produce a shopping mall, a casino, or a stadium.
And like the deceptive chaos of contemporary virality I criticized on
Châtelet’s terms, Baudrillard’s vision
is deceptive because it doesn’t really do justice to the concrete reality of the situation in question.</p>
<p>It’s more sticky than one might think, here’s an example:
a conventional newspaper might recommend movies and music on the basis of critics,
their recommendations gradually becoming more and more valuable
as their readers come to trust them more and more.
Money and time has to be invested in compensating this critic,
opportunities are lost because the critic does not always like the thing it would be very convenient for them to like,
and if they are suddenly fired the next critic will have quite a rough go.
A shopping mall has to be built, leases have to be signed with businesses for a length of time,
and they cannot be easily reconfigured either.</p>
<p>What social media platforms have to offer is a plethora of ‘content’ of every sort, ready made even before
a hefty sum is invested into a future celebrity,
all to be bombarded at any audience at the platform’s earliest convenience.
In the past, the swirl’s pace was practically limited by the need to install new light displays,
replace billboards, and renovate the fountains.
Our digital architecture is akin to a city of electronic billboards,
instantly configurable and rapidly changing,
producing vampiric stimuli only barely beholden to the laws of labor and construction.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The new architecture of social media does not even have the chitinous shell of the Vegas strip,
it is becoming more like a dream world,
changing at the speed of thought.
Virality occurs when this dream world tests new content to great success.</p>
<p>Whether due to a change in target demographic,
a theme and aesthetic becoming stale,
or a desire to sell more efficiently,
marketing enterprises have always been innovating.
Innovation is generally brought about by testing,
the combination of a new idea, data collection,
and quantitative analysis of that data,
to see how effective the new approach was.</p>
<p>A clear example of this is A/B testing,
a method whereby users of an online service
are randomly served with different versions of the service,
and their interactions with it are collected and compared (Scott W. H. Young, 2014).
Social media features a multiplicity
of variations,
all ready for testing against any number of users.
Through a hybrid of A/B testing and user-profiling,
viral media is the product of the most successful
testing in social media.</p>
<p>This is because virality is the combination of a person or piece of media
receiving low levels of attention, and then becoming very popular,
is the result of a subtle change in a recommendation algorithm,
search feature, or other method used to deliver potentially attention-grabbing
content to some viewers,
and then to expand and show more and more based on its initial successes.</p>
<h2 id="human-vectors">Human Vectors</h2>
<p>Viral content isn’t just successful because
recommendation algorithms put innovative media in front of a bunch of people,
but because social media accommodates self-directed exploration by bored users,
providing search and filtering tools to allow an interested user to search for new media,
a technologically augmented practice similar to crate digging
that adeptly incorporates user profiling, search ranking, and chance
with the user’s own self-knowledge.
This is easily demonstrable in the case of YouTube,
by making an identical search in two windows, one via an active account attached
on which many videos have been watched, and one
without an account.
The results will differ significantly, and will also shift upon subsequent page loads,
the former showing the adjustments made to search based on your user profile,
the latter showing either A/B testing
or perhaps a more inscrutable system accounting for your presumed disinterest in the first results.</p>
<h2 id="democracy">Democracy?</h2>
<p>As virality characterizes social media’s divergence
from mass media,
seeming to substitute embedded personalities and distribution technologies
for flexible and inventive multiplicity
that varies based on user engagement,
it is tempting to think that virality is democratic.</p>
<p>However, this is not the case.
Democracy is defined by the New Oxford American Dictionary as ‘a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.’
While content is certainly often ranked and recommended on social media platforms
according to its popularity,
this is mediated by an opaque set of concerns that vary between between platforms.
A public statement from YouTube in 2012 states that their search ‘now optimized [sic] for time watched.’
The Verge reports numerous other instances of changes in their article ‘The golden age of YouTube is over’,
noting that changes ‘[tipped] the scales in favor of [certain] organizations or creators — big ones, mostly.’
Other algorithms are even more opaque, a testament to how far they are from directly democratic:
Forbes reports ‘Hacking Social Algorithms Is the New Marketing’,
demonstrating through the different strategies employed on every platform
and the degree to which the techniques are employed in concert with advertising
that algorithmic recommendations and user preference are incredibly mediated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Virality is not evidence of chaos, nor of democracy,
but of highly intentional and adaptive
advertising techniques hungrily seeking out the attention of the spectators.
Viral videos and content are the experiments of social media discovery algorithms
and tools at their most successful, representative
of the contrast between social media and the previous mass media.</p>

<p>Hi there, my name is Jen and I am building <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a multicurrency personal finance tool for the modern-day spender.</p>

<p>Frugality is in my blood. Early on in life, I learned the value of a dollar from my parents and have been particularly frugal (or money-conscious) since I quit my full-time job 4 years ago.</p>

<p>This has permeated all aspects of my life now, as a self-proclaimed “froodie”– a frugal foodie (sure you can pay top dollar for the best food, but the real gems are when you find unfathomable value for the taste) and as the founder of a budgeting app. So it’s no surprise that in building my app, I found myself evaluating if paying for a service was worth saving the time it would take to just roll my own solution.</p>

<p>I’m a big believer that time is money, so if you value your time at a certain rate, then you can easily figure out if spending 1 to 2 hours engineering your own solution is worth yet another recurring monthly charge for potentially the lifetime of your product. Remember, it all adds up!</p>

<p>I have outlined 3 home-grown solutions which are currently saving me in total over $100 per month and I am confident these solutions can sustain Lunch Money well through the first 1000 users. As volumes increase, I will surely re-evaluate these solutions but until then, here they are!</p>



<h3 id="the-problem-lots-of-repeated-information-in-support-requests">The problem: Lots of repeated information in support requests</h3>

<p>Since launching, I’ve been getting a steady stream of support requests and questions from users. That along with the fact that I was pushing out new features and improvements on the daily means a lot of information I was conveying would quickly be outdated.</p>

<p>I was also noticing a lot of the same questions. While this was a strong indicator that certain parts of the product could be more intuitive or have a walkthrough, I felt it was nearing the time for Lunch Money to have a centralized knowledge base.</p>

<h3 id="the-hunt-for-a-solution">The hunt for a solution</h3>

<p>Something like Discourse would be cool to have eventually if I build a community around Lunch Money, but for now it didn’t make sense. Since our features are still evolving, I didn’t want to worry so much about outdated answers. Also, at $100 per month, the price point is unjustifiable.</p>

<p>I found that knowledge bases are typically a feature as part of a larger set of tools for customer support. The most popular option I could find was Zendesk, whose support docs system is an add-on, so you have to subscribe to a base plan first which in total would cost you at least $10 per month.</p>

<p>I also found other solutions such as Helpscout, offered at $25/month and packed with features, as well as startups using Notion as a knowledge base. Though they lack analytics and the general look and feel of a knowledge base, the price comes in lower at $4 up to $8 per month.</p>

<p>It was looking like it would cost on average about $10/month for a decently-featured hosted version. From afar, it was enticing given that these services were offering beautiful templates that were already fully hooked up and all you had to do was provide the content.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-to-host-my-own">Deciding to host my own</h3>

<p>I realized that all I really needed for my knowledge base was a good-looking template. All the other features that were offered were not so useful to me and would only be distractions (e.g. comments, live chat, etc). I also didn’t want to spend too much time beyond writing content to get this off the ground.</p>

<p>This led me to browsing <a href="https://themeforest.net/">Themeforest</a> for some Jekyll or Hugo themes since I was familiar with these static-site generators and I wasn’t looking for the bloat that came with a Wordpress or Ghost site.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/Screenshot%202019-11-20%2018.22.06.png" alt="" title="Lunch Money knowledge base"><span>Lunch Money’s knowledge base, powered by Jekyll (free) template from Themeforest for one-time payment of $49</span></p>

<p>It took me 10 minutes to find a beautiful, simple template that met my basic needs and it costed a one-time fee of $49. So this template would pay for itself after just a couple of months and considering a docs site is something I would want to have for as long as the product is around, this will end up saving me a lot. I bought the template, added some basic content, pushed it to Github and deployed it for free with Netlify.</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 10 minutes to find the template, 5 minutes to deploy to Github and Netlify (excludes content-writing time)</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Notion offered at $4 - $8 per month</li>
<li>Freshdesk offered at $15/month</li>
<li>Helpscout offered at $25/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $15 per month or $180 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $49</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself in:</strong> just over 3 months</p>



<p>While researching customer support tools, I noticed they also handle support tickets that come in through email. However, at those price points, I simply couldn’t justify it. I used a service like Freshdesk exclusively at my first start-up and I can’t exactly pinpoint the value it brought from separating support requests from my normal inbox.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing– your first few customers are so important. They will be your champions later on. It’s imperative to give top-notch service from the very beginning. For me, this means support requests have a high priority and deserve to go to my work inbox which I check most frequently. I also don’t want to install yet another app on my phone or have yet another tab always open in Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-my-support-email-for-free">Setting up my support email for free</h3>

<p>To allow users to email me at support@lunchmoney.app, I hooked up the domain to Mailgun (free) <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html#inbound-routes-and-parsing">to receive emails and route them appropriately to my inbox</a>. This initially saved me the $6 it would cost to get on GSuite and have Google manage my work domain.</p>

<p>While I was happy with this solution for the first few months, I quickly noticed issues with relying on a free tier for something as important as my email. I was experiencing almost no deliverability to outlook.com and hotmail.com email addresses. This is because spammers also tend to use these services (Mailgun, Sendgrid) and they end up “polluting” the shared IPs that are used in these free tiers, causing them to be blacklisted by email service providers.</p>

<p>Eventually, I grew frustrated enough with the deliverability issues that I upgraded from Mailgun to GSuite.</p>

<p>Having every form of communication from my users arrive in my work inbox has actually simplified my workflow and hasn’t felt overwhelming yet. Furthermore, I use filters, tags and the snooze feature religiously, so if you have a good system, this can also help to improve your workflow. My work email is essentially my TODO list so I like to keep it clean and as close to empty as possible!</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings-1">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 15 minutes to set up Mailgun and/or GSuite</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Zendesk offered at $5/month</li>
<li>Front offered at $12 per month</li>
<li>HiverHQ offered at $15/month</li>
<li>Helpscout offered at $25/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $15 per month or $180 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $6/month</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself:</strong> immediately</p>



<p>Let’s talk about drip campaigns. They are crucial to customer engagement and guiding your users to eventual conversion. However, many tools out there designed to help you manage your drip campaigns are overloaded with features and therefore really expensive. Furthermore, they require set up and integration since you’ll want to update the service with your customer’s traits so they can be segmented and targeted properly. Overall, I felt these tools brought a lot of extra overhead for a cost that was way too high.</p>

<p>So I started thinking about what it would take to implement my own simple drip campaign. I figured I could start off pretty simple and just email a user over the course of their trial 3 times: when they sign up, one week before their trial ends to offer a trial extension, and on the last day of their trial.</p>

<p>These were all straightforward queries to the database. I store the join dates for all users as well as a type so I know how long their trial is. I also have to hit the Stripe API to make sure that I wasn’t asking already-converted users to convert. This was another nice thing– I could query all the information directly when I needed it, instead of playing telephone between multiple services via webhooks.</p>

<p>Using Redis queues (free as a Heroku add-on) with <a href="https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/">Bull</a>, I created a daily repeating worker which would, for each email template, query the database and retrieve all eligible users, double check their Stripe status and double check that they haven’t already been sent this email (safeguarding in case the queue hiccups and the job retries itself) and eventually sends the email.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> as my email service provider. I’m a big fan of Postmark after experiencing the lowest lows with Sendgrid and Mailgun. Postmark has a rigid selection process to ensure spammers do not get on their platform and so they maintain high deliverability rates. The best part is they offer a $75 credit to bootstrapped startups which gets you 7 months of free service if you send under 10,000 emails a month.</p>

<p>My solution is working great for me so far as I have no complaints. I have all the open rate and CTR stats I need from Postmark and I can corroborate the data easily by querying my database to see how many actually extended their trial. I have also since added a 4th email: if you extend your trial, we send an email to follow up on how the extension is going.</p>

<p>The key is to make your homegrown solution robust and extensible from the beginning. I can’t see a reason yet why I would switch to a paid full-service tool anytime soon!</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings-2">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 3 hours to set up queues once and write the code to power your campaign and write tests</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Drip offered at $49/month</li>
<li>Intercom offered at $49/month</li>
<li>Customer.io offered at $150/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $80 per month or $960 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 hours at $75/hour = $150 in engineering cost</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself in:</strong> 3 months</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Over the last week, I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lucerne">Lucerne</a>, a Twitter “reader” app built to fit my personal needs from Twitter. It’s been an interesting exercise in <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/">building a tool around workflows</a>, so I wanted to tell you the story of how the design came to be, and what I’ve noticed using Lucerne for my daily escapades into the Twittersphere.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne.png" alt="Lucerne in action"></p>
<p>Like many of my personal tools, Lucerne is built with my <a href="https://dotink.co/">Ink programming language</a> on the backend and my <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/torus">Torus</a> UI library on the frontend. It’s made just for me at the moment, but given the interest I’ve gotten about Lucerne online, I might make a version open for anyone to use.</p>
<h2 id="designing-myself-a-better-twitter">Designing myself a better Twitter</h2>
<p>For me, Twitter serves two purposes. First, it’s a <em>learning tool</em>. There are lots of smart folks talking to each other and sharing what they’re thinking about on Twitter from software to economics to writing, and I can find on Twitter opinions or perspectives I can’t find on blogs or books. Second, it’s a <em>place for me to share whatever I’m working on</em> on my blog or on my side projects with my audience. Lucerne is designed around these two primary workflows: learning and sharing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s main user interface, the algorithmic timeline, is bad for using Twitter as a learning tool. It feels like sticking a straw into a firehouse and hoping you’ll suck out enough interesting insights to be worth the effort. I wanted a better way for me to discover and keep track of interesting conversations happening on Twitter about any topic. Twitter does provide decent tools for me to share my work online – things like scheduled tweets, analytics, notifications, and search – but they’re not in one place, so I wanted to consolidate these tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-timeline.jpg" alt="A timeline view in Lucerne"></p>
<p>With these two goals in mind, I also wanted Lucerne to be a tool that could <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">grow with me as I used it</a>, so I could mold my experience of Twitter around what I found to be most useful to me over time. More than other tools, Twitter feels organic and constantly changing. I didn’t want to have to bake in all the tools and dials I might ever want to use from the get-go. Instead, I wanted to be able to stumble into interesting use cases as I used Lucerne over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-querybar.jpg" alt="Performing a search in Lucerne"></p>
<p>To make it possible to grow Lucerne as a tool gradually around my use cases like this, Lucerne is designed primarily around one important idea: <strong>filtered searches saved as “channels”</strong>. Feeding from the firehose of conversations on Twitter, a “channel” is a small filtered stream of tweets defined by a particular search query. Here are some examples of useful filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>“tweets between A and B about #topic” – <code>(from:A OR from:B) #topic</code></li>
<li>“tweets about abc.com with more than 100 likes” – <code>url:abc.com min_faves:100</code></li>
<li>“tweets by A that include images, but exclude retweets” – <code>from:A filter:images -filter:retweets</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With Lucerne, I can search for interesting conversations happening on Twitter by experimenting with these filters. When any filter seems particular useful, I can save it to check again later, by adding it to the left sidebar with a name. As I use the app, I end up curating an ever-changing personalized collection of these channels in my sidebar that provide multiple different views onto the firehose of Twitter.</p>
<p>“But Linus,” I hear you saying, “you can search and save them as timelines on Twitter’s app and Tweetdeck.” Yes, you’re right, and most of the search filters Lucerne uses are also available on Twitter. But the important thing about Lucerne isn’t just that you can search, but that <strong>playing with filters and saving the good ones is the primary user interface</strong>. On Twitter, you might search once or twice to find something useful, but you’re <em>mostly</em> interacting with a single timeline passively. With Lucerne, most of my use is exploring and adding to a curated list of filters, and exploration and consumption are one and the same activity. As I’ll explain later from my personal experience, this makes a big difference in how much I can get out of Twitter.</p>
<p>I think the most important design lessons in Lucerne is what I <em>didn’t</em> do: I could have made a list of features that I might have wanted in the beginning, and baked it all into the app. Features like “follow specific threads”, “see top tweets from a particular user”, “follow hashtags”, or “hide retweets from the timeline.” But instead of adding a million settings and toggles, I found what I would consider to be the “atoms”, the common building blocks, of all of these use cases, and baked it into the core of the app instead. All these use cases above can be performed just as easily as filtered searches, and because these filters can be saved and referenced later, Lucerne can grow around my exact use cases <em>as I continue using it</em>. I don’t have to design for all my use cases from the start. This is what I mean when I say <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">we need to design tools to grow with us</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to this main idea of channels, Lucerne has a few other design considerations to improve how Twitter works for me. All the engagement stats I care about are present in a single screen, so I don’t have to annoyingly load five different pages every time, but they’re out of the way of the main “timeline” view, because I don’t want them in my face all the time. There’s a small pane on the right showing me my most recent new followers, which is sometimes useful when I see someone particularly interesting and want to reach back out to them. This also saves me a few clicks every time. Lastly, I intentionally didn’t implement <em>infinite scrolling</em>, in lieu of a simple “load more” button. This makes endlessly scrolling a conscious enough action for me that I end up wasting less time scrolling through my timeline. It goes without saying, all of these experiences are also much better because I don’t serve myself ads in between my tweets. My timeline feels cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="how-im-using-lucerne">How I’m using Lucerne</h2>
<p>I reached an “MVP” stage with Lucerne a few days ago, and since then, I’ve used Lucerne more and Twitter’s website less for browsing through Twitter. Lucerne isn’t meant to be a Twitter <em>replacement</em>. Twitter’s web app is still great for writing and following threads, for example, and I don’t want to have to re-create something that’s already fine for my use. But for my two main workflows of <em>learning</em> and <em>tracking my progress</em> on Twitter, Lucerne works better for me.</p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve noticed from using the client is that it turns Twitter from a consumption experience into an exploratory experience. Instead of drinking from a firehose through a straw, the firehose feeds into an evolving castle of infinite fountains, and my job is to look around the castle for the fountains of information that seem more interesting or insightful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m pulling from the firehose of Twitter instead of constantly poking straws into the stream to see what I luck out with.</p>
<p>The real fun of using Lucerne to explore Twitter isn’t just reading tweets in a timeline, but poking around in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">infinite library</a> that Twitter sometimes feels like, collecting the interesting streams of information into my pocket.</p>
<p>Here are a few use cases I stumbled into while using Lucerne that I otherwise couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Following interesting threads.</strong> I often stumble into interesting threads of tweets that I want to track somehow. While using Lucerne, I ran into one tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">@geoffreylitt</a> building a Twitter browser extension called Twemex, and another thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/TZhongg">@TZhongg</a> asking for book recommendations. Normally, I would probably just bookmark it and never check it again, but with Lucerne, I just saved filters for “replies to this tweet” as channels in my sidebar, and I’ve checked them regularly since to find interesting project updates and book recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Following an account’s tweets on a topic.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion">@Noahpinion</a> is one of those accounts that have a lot of interesting ideas to share covering a huge range of topics. Sometimes about foreign policy, sometimes about fiscal policy and economics, sometimes about China. I wanted to be able to follow “just tweets about this account on Japan”, for example, and I could do this trivially by setting up a channel <code>from:Noahpinion Japan</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-usercard.jpg" alt="Lucerne looking at tweets by @devonzuegel"></p>
<p><strong>Following an aesthetic.</strong> I noticed recently that a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/devonzuegel">@devonzuegel</a>’s tweets about urban design either contain interesting quotes from books or inspiring historical photographs. I follow her, but thought it would be nice to have a separate channel to just keep track of these. So I made a filter for <code>from:devonzuegel filter:images</code>, for “tweets containing images from @devonzuegel” which I’ve been enjoying checking once every one or two days. Through this channel, I also discovered a couple of other accounts that share photographs of urban design that I otherwise would have missed.</p>
<p><strong>“Following” high-noise accounts without following.</strong> There are a few accounts, like @naval, @david_perell, or @paulg that occasionally tweet really interesting ideas, but whom I don’t follow because there’s a lot of noise. With Lucerne, I could create channels like <code>from:david_perell -filter:replies min_faves:100</code> to “follow” the most popular tweets from these accounts without actually following them into my home timeline. I’ve found this so useful that I added a “top” button to profile cards that lets me one-click search a filter for “popular tweets from this person”, which is much more helpful than what Twitter’s web app gets you on a profile page, which are just the latest tweets they happened to have sent.</p>
<p>Over time, I think my curated list of channels is going to become an interesting index into my own interests, perspective, and information consumption habits, which I find a really cool idea. I’m excited about how Lucerne can help me use Twitter to learn and share better going forward, and I"m also curious about how I could apply this idea of “tools that grow as you use it” to other parts of my life, like the web browser or my email experience.</p>
<p>And because I know you’re asking: while I don’t think I’m going to make this current version of Lucerne open for public …</p></article></div>

There are over 250 billion microcontrollers in the world and this number is projected to grow over the coming years. As a result of this, deep learning on embedded devices is one of the fastest-growing fields. This area is popularly known as tiny machine learning (TinyML). That said, embedded devices pose a couple of challenges, key among them being their low processing power and limited memory. Machine learning models must therefore be able to work on just a few kilobytes of memory. They must also be able to perform inferencing with the low processing power available in embedded systems. In this piece, we’ll look at TensorFlow Lite Micro (TF Micro) whose aim is to run deep learning models on embedded systems. TF Micro is an open-source ML inference framework that has been fronted by researchers from Google and Harvard University. It addresses the resource constraints faced with running deep learning models on embedded systems.</p><p id="c221">The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08678" rel="noopener">authors</a> of the above TinyML article start by highlighting some of the applications of TinyML technology. Key among them being:</p><ul><li id="a784">Wakeword detection — waking up a device with a certain phrase, e.g., ‘Ok, Google.’</li><li id="aee7">Predictive maintenance — resulting from analysis and modeling of signals from microphones, sensors, and accelerometers, just to mention a few.</li><li id="8c6c">Acoustic-anomaly detection.</li><li id="169b">Visual object detection.</li><li id="039e">Human-activity recognition.</li></ul><p id="148a">Next, the authors highlight the major challenges faced when implementing machine learning in embedded devices. These include:</p><ul><li id="2bf1">There is a lack of a unified TinyML framework for embedded devices.</li><li id="c5f9">Deploying models on embedded devices is slow.</li><li id="5cd9">Vendors produce different hardware types, hence making it difficult to evaluate hardware performance.</li><li id="f019">There is a lack of basic features such as memory management and library support.</li></ul><p id="d60d">The proposed TensorFlow Lite Micro (TF Micro) is aimed at solving these challenges.</p><p id="c14f">The TF Micro framework has been designed with the following principles:</p><h2 id="67dc">Minimize Feature Scope for Portability</h2><p id="c181">This means that an embedded machine learning framework assumes that the model, input data, and output arrays are in memory. The framework should handle ML computations based on those values, meaning that the library will omit features such as loading models from a filesystem or accessing peripherals for inputs. This design principle is crucial because many embedded platforms don’t have a memory management mechanism as well as library support.</p><h2 id="da0f">Enable Vendor Contributions to Span Ecosystem</h2><p id="5819">As a result of device fragmentation, developers can’t build software that runs well on different embedded platforms. In order to tackle this challenge, the authors ensure that optimizing the core library operations is easy. They aim for ensuring significant technical support for developers. The authors also encourage submissions to a library repository.</p><h2 id="8c6b">Reuse TensorFlow Tools for Scalability</h2><p id="2b6f">Exporting a model comes with its own set of challenges. Key among them being export errors that result from developers converting a model to a format that can run on an embedded device. Another challenge is the lack of support for some operations on the target device. It is also important to note that most models are trained on floating operations and these operations consume more space and memory and would therefore be unsuitable for an embedded device. This can be addressed by converting them to a quantized representation. This, however, increases the exporter complexity. To address these challenges, a converter is built on top of the existing TensorFlow Lite toolchain. This has been extended for deeply embedded machine learning systems.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1082/1*uzTxmEwSPUqcqMoeYZE-dA.png" width="541" height="179" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*uzTxmEwSPUqcqMoeYZE-dA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1082/1*uzTxmEwSPUqcqMoeYZE-dA.png 541w" sizes="541px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*uzTxmEwSPUqcqMoeYZE-dA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="bf8c">Build System for Heterogeneous Support</h2><p id="6040">This feature aims at achieving a flexible build environment that doesn’t rely on any one platform. This would definitely encourage the adoption of TF Micro by developers.</p><p id="9a9b">Developing a TF Micro application involves a couple of steps. The first one is to create a live neural-network-model object in memory. The application developer starts by producing an operator resolver object via the Client API. The operator resolver controls which operations link to the final binary in order to reduce the size of the executable.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/996/1*v5y1QXRAD2_0PXEHc5h0TQ.png" width="498" height="513" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*v5y1QXRAD2_0PXEHc5h0TQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/996/1*v5y1QXRAD2_0PXEHc5h0TQ.png 498w" sizes="498px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*v5y1QXRAD2_0PXEHc5h0TQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="5506">The second step is to provide a contiguous memory array referred to as the arena. The arena holds intermediate results and variables that are needed by the interpreter.</p><p id="267b">The third step is to create an interpreter instance. The instance arguments are the model, operator resolver, and the arena. During the initialization phase, the interpreter allocates all required memory from the arena. All communications between the interpreter and operators are handled by a C API. This ensures that operator implementations are modular and independent of the interpreter’s implementation.</p><p id="e98e">The fourth step is the model execution. At this point, the application retrieves pointers to the memory regions that represent the model inputs. It then populates them with values mainly obtained from sensors or user-supplied data. With the inputs available, the interpreter is invoked so that it can perform model calculations.</p><p id="192b">Finally, the interpreter returns control to the application after it has evaluated all the operations.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>One of the most common causes of procrastination is the fear of failure.</p><p>Let’s imagine we have a task to do and we feel negative about it for some reason.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image19.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Negative emotions are like a hill"></p><p>That makes it harder to do, but we can&nbsp;<em>make it even harder</em>. Much harder. How?</p><p>We might think&nbsp;<strong>we cannot possibly make a single mistake.</strong></p><p>Maybe we adopted this attitude from our parents or our teachers in school. Whatever the reason, many of us fear failure and don’t see it as a natural part of the process.</p><p>So, failure turns from something natural, though unpleasant, into a lethal threat.&nbsp;<strong>Every simple task becomes a tightrope walk over a deadly chasm.</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image27.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of failure is like a chasm"></p><p>No wonder the fear of failure is so paralyzing. When we perceive every mistake as a possible death (or sacking, or dropping out, or a proposal rejection), it raises our stress levels and we try to relieve them by procrastinating.</p><p>We make ourselves into a tightrope walker.</p><h2><strong>What a tightrope walker believes</strong></h2><h3><strong>If I fail, I’m worthless and destined to die</strong></h3><p><em>If this business fails, I’m clearly someone who can’t have any kind of business.</em></p><p><em>If this book doesn’t hit the bestseller list, I’m clearly not a good writer.</em></p><p><em>If I don’t pass this subject, I’m clearly never going to be good at it.</em></p><p>Some of us have a tendency to view failure as a fatal verdict.</p><p><em>If I fail, I’m clearly not good enough.</em></p><p>When we fail (which we inevitably will at some point), we can take it as the end. We get crushed.</p><p><em>Well, better do something else.</em></p><p>The thing is, everyone fails. We lose money, we lose partners, projects fail… but not all of us react in the same way.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image43.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Different reactions to failure"></p><p><strong>Most of the time, failure isn’t a fall off a cliff.</strong></p><p>We humans have an uncanny ability to recover from all sorts of mistakes,&nbsp;<em>if we allow ourselves to.</em></p><p>It’s foolish to expect that we'll be good at everything we try and won’t fail ever.</p><p>Let’s update our view of failure.</p><h3><strong>When I fail, I’ll get back on my feet</strong></h3><p>Everything doesn’t depend on one single performance most of the time.</p><p><strong>When you look at the lives of successful people, we see that they failed many, many times.</strong></p><p>Legendary investor Ray Dalio at one point lost all his money. Entrepreneur Elon Musk at one point didn’t have enough money for rent. Apple founder Steve Jobs was at one point kicked out of the very company he started!</p><p>If these people took those failures as fatal diagnoses of their worthlessness, neither one of them would build billion dollar companies.</p><p>They learned from their failures and got back into a ring.</p><p><strong>Failures big and small happen all the time. The important part is recovering, learning from them (so then they don’t repeat) and taking them in stride.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = my self-worth</strong></h3><p>As with perfectionists, people who fear failure identify with their work.</p><p>New project? If it doesn’t pan out, I’m a failure.</p><p>Test in school? If I get an F, I’m an idiot.</p><p>If I’m not first, I’m below average.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image55.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Self-worth tied to an outcome"></p><p>Failure is not a fatal diagnosis. One F doesn’t make someone an idiot, it simply points to their current level of mastery of the subject. And that level can improve with effort.</p><p><strong>Failure is not a diagnosis of worthlessness.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = current level of ability, I can always improve</strong></h3><p>You’re at a competition and you lose.</p><p>You’re taking a test and you hand in an empty test with just your name.</p><p>You make a presentation on the wrong topic.</p><p>Happens to everyone. You can’t win every contest and succeed with every project for the rest of your life.</p><p>So why not take a particular performance (presentation, project, test,...) as just one performance at one point in time?</p><p>Every product of our effort is a clue whether we’re going in the right direction or not.</p><p>Bad performance? Okay, what do we have to change? How can I get better at this?</p><p>Good performance? Awesome, let’s go full steam ahead.</p><h2><strong>Mindset shifts</strong></h2><p>To summarize, here are the 2 main mindset shifts to take away:</p><ul><li>When I fail, I take it as a fatal diagnosis of my worthlessness.<br>→<br><strong>When I fail, I’ll reflect on how I can improve.</strong></li><li>My performance = my self-worth.<br>→<br><strong>My performance = my current level of ability.</strong></li></ul><p>Now let’s take a look at some tools and exercises that can help us manage and reduce the fear of failure.</p><div><div><p>Hi there! This is a free sample chapter from our book.</p><p>If you want to get a whole comprehensive guide about procrastination and learn about each fear deeply,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/guide">check out our handbook.</a></p><p>We put hundreds of hours of research into it, so you don’t have to. And also we keep updating it often to give you the best, most concrete strategies for dealing with procrastination.</p></div></div><h2><strong>1. Put the fear of failure into perspective</strong></h2><h3><strong>How to overcome fear: Understand your options</strong></h3><p>We sometimes think that our situation is one big dead-end.</p><p>We might have a job we depend on and be unable to do what we want because it would mean losing it.</p><p>Or we might have one big project we’re working on that would sink us deep into debt if it didn’t pan out.</p><p>The problem with scenarios like this is that they put tremendous pressure on us.</p><p>And we try to ease it off by procrastinating.</p><p>If we have one thing to do and its failure would mean the end of the world, every step we’re unsure of becomes a tightrope walk.</p><p>One email or a blank page of a document turns into the possibility of apocalypse.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be stressed in a situation like that?</p><p>What if we could ease the pressure a little more?</p><h2><strong>Use the fear of regret</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image13.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of regret outweighing fear of failure"></p><p>Elon Musk estimated the odds of his success with SpaceX to be about 40%.</p><p>Jeff Bezos thought Amazon had about 30 % chance of succeeding.</p><p>How then could they make the decision to start? How come they didn't worry and dwell on those odds? How could Musk invest millions of his own money into SpaceX?</p><p><strong>Because it was worth it.</strong></p><p>Fear is only one side of the equation. Depression, regret, sadness,.. those are on the other side.</p><p>For Musk, the other side of the equation was profound sadness. If humanity couldn't go to Mars, that would be depressing to him on a fundamental level.</p><p>For Bezos, it was regret that helped him overcome his fear.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Golang also known as Go is an open-source, compiled and statically typed programming language developed by Google.</p><p>Go is a compiled, concurrent, statically-typed general purpose programming language with simple syntax and a robust standard libraries. Go improves upon concepts like imperative and object-oriented programming and thereby simplifies the working environment for developers.</p><p>In this guide, you will learn everything you need to know to get started using Go to build real-world applications.</p><h2 id="why-learn-golang">Why learn Golang?</h2><p>Now you still might be asking why should I learn Golang with all the other alternatives out there. Here is a list of some of the cons of the Go programming language.</p><ul><li>Simple syntax - Go has concise and straightforward syntax that makes writing readable and maintainable code easy.</li><li>Compiled language</li><li>Static linking - The compiler supports static linking which means you can statically link your project into one massive binary and then simply deploy it to the cloud or a server.</li><li>Open source - Go is open-source so you can read the source code and contribute to the repository.</li></ul><p>Now that you have a sense of what Golang is and what it brings to the table let's jump into the installation and basics.</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>Go can be installed on all three major platforms Windows, Linux and Mac. </p><h3 id="windows-">Windows:</h3><p>Download the latest <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Windows Golang MSI</a> and execute it on your machine. Follow the instruction prompts to install Go in your root directory and automatically set up an environment variable for your terminal.</p><h3 id="linux-">Linux:</h3><p>On Linux you can download the tar file from the <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">official website</a> and unzip it to /usr/local.</p><h3 id="mac-">Mac:</h3><p>On Mac you can download the Mac installer from the <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">official website</a> and execute it using a double tap. </p><h3 id="verifying-the-installation-">Verifying the installation:</h3><p> You can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal.</p><pre><code>go --version</code></pre><p>After installing, you will continue by taking a look at the basic syntax and features Golang provides.</p><h2 id="basic-structure">Basic structure</h2><p>Let's start by taking a look at the basic structure of a Golang program. For that, we are going to take a look at a hello world example.</p><pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}</code></pre><p>All Go programs must be part of a package, and here you use main to make the file executable. The main package requires a main function, which will be called when running the file.</p><p>You must import all the packages you use including all the standard libraries like fmt in this case.</p><p>Use the following command in your terminal to run the file:</p><pre><code>go run main.go</code></pre><h2 id="variables">Variables</h2><p>In this section, you will learn the different ways to declare and initialize variables.</p><p>Golang is statically typed, which means that variables either explicitly or implicitly assign a type before your program runs.</p><h3 id="declaring-variables-">Declaring variables:</h3><p>Variables can be declared using the <em>var</em> keyword followed by the <em>variable name</em> and the <em>datatype</em>.</p><pre><code>var i int
var s string</code></pre><h3 id="initializing-variables-">Initializing variables:</h3><p>After declaring the variables they can be initialized using the <em>=</em> operator.</p><pre><code>i = 20
s = "Some String"</code></pre><p>It is equally valid to declare and initialize the variable in a single line.</p><pre><code>var k int = 35</code></pre><p>You can also omit the type when initializing the variable at the time of declaration.</p><pre><code>var score = 10</code></pre><h3 id="short-variable-declaration-">Short variable declaration:</h3><p>The <em>var</em> keyword can also be omitted using the <em>:=</em> short variable declarator.</p><pre><code>j := 50
str := "Some String!"</code></pre><h3 id="declaring-multiple-variables-">Declaring multiple variables:</h3><p>It is also possible to declare multiple variables in a single line of code.</p><pre><code>firstName, lastName := "FirstName", "LastName"</code></pre><h3 id="variable-declaration-block-">Variable Declaration Block:</h3><p>Variable declarations can also be grouped together for better readability and cleaner code.</p><pre><code>var (
    name = "Donald Duck"
    age  = 50
)</code></pre><h2 id="constants">Constants</h2><p>A constant is a variable with a fixed value that cannot change under any circumstances.</p><h3 id="declaring-a-constant-">Declaring a constant:</h3><p>Constants are declared by using the <em>const</em> keyword instead of <em>var</em>. You must assign the value at the time of the declaration because the value will fix it after that.</p><pre><code>const PI float64 = 3.14159265359
const VALUE = 1000</code></pre><p>Note: The names of constant variables are usually written in uppercase.</p><h3 id="declaring-using-a-declaration-block-">Declaring using a declaration block:</h3><p>Constants can also be declared using declaration blocks for better readability.</p><pre><code>const (
	PRODUCT  = "Ice Cream"
	QUANTITY = 50
)</code></pre><h2 id="datatypes">Datatypes</h2><p>As already mentioned Golang is a statically typed programming language, which means that variables always have a type that cannot change.</p><p>Here is a list of all the datatypes available in Golang:</p><pre><code>uint8       unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)
int8        signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers
complex64   complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32

uint     unsigned, either 32 or 64 bits
int      signed, either 32 or 64 bits
uintptr  unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value</code></pre><p>You can set the data type of a variable after the variable name.</p><pre><code>// Integer
var i int = 5
fmt.Println(i)

// String
var s string = "Hello World!"
fmt.Println(s)

// Float
var f float64 = 3.14159265359
fmt.Println(f)

// Boolean
var b bool = true
fmt.Println(b)</code></pre><h2 id="converting-datatypes">Converting Datatypes</h2><p>Converting also known as casting datatypes, is an important concept when needing a precise type is expected. This section will show you the most common type conversions.</p><h3 id="string-to-float-">String to float:</h3><p>One of the most common conversions is a string to a float. For this, you use the strconv package, which is the standard package for converting strings to basic datatypes.</p><pre><code>s := "3.1415926535"
f, err := strconv.ParseFloat(s, 8)

if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error convert string to integer", err)
}

fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(f))</code></pre><h3 id="float-to-string-">Float to string:</h3><p>Converting a float to a string is a bit easier because their cannot be an error.</p><pre><code>var flo float64 = 3.1415926535
var strFlo string = strconv.FormatFloat(flo, 'E', -1, 32)
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(strFlo))</code></pre><h3 id="float-to-int-">Float to int:</h3><p>Casting of basic datatypes like int and floats is a lot easier and can be done using the following syntax.</p><pre><code>var f32 float32 = 3.1415926535
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(f32))

i32 := int32(f32)
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(i32))</code></pre><h2 id="operators">Operators</h2><p>An operator is a symbol that tells the Go compiler to perform a specific action. The following code blocks will show you all the basic operators of the Go programming language and how you can use them in your applications.</p><h3 id="arithmetic-operators-">Arithmetic Operators:</h3><p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform common arithmetic actions like adding or subtracting numbers. Here is a list of the most common arithmetic operators:</p><ul><li>'+' (Addition) - Adds to operands</li><li>'-' (Subtraction) - Builds the sum of two numbers by subtracting them</li><li>'*' (Multiplication) - Multiplies two values with each other</li><li>'/' (Division) - Divides two values</li><li>'%' (Modulus) - Gets the remainder after an integer division</li></ul><p>Let's look at how you can actually use these operators in your applications.</p><pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i int = 10
    var k int = 20

    // Arithmetic Operators
    fmt.Printf("i + k = %d\n", i+k)
    fmt.Printf("i - k = %d\n", i-k)
    fmt.Printf("i * k = %d\n", i*k)
    fmt.Printf("i / k = %d\n", i/k)
    fmt.Printf("i mod k = %d\n", i%k)
}</code></pre><p>The output of running the above program should be:</p><pre><code># Output
i + k = 30
i - k = -10
i * k = 200
i / k = 0
i mod k = 10</code></pre><h3 id="comparison-operators-">Comparison Operators:</h3><p>Comparison operators are used to compare two values with each other.</p><ul><li>'==' (Equal to) - Returns true if x is equal to y</li><li> '!=' (Not equal to) - Returns true if x is not equal y</li><li>'&lt;' (Lesser than) - Returns true if x is lesser than y </li><li>'&lt;=' (Lesser than Equal to) - Returns true if x is lesser than or equal to y</li><li>'&gt;' (Greater than) - Returns true if x is greater than y </li><li>'&gt;=' (Greater than Equal to) - Returns true if x is greater than or equal to y</li></ul><p>Here is an example of these operators in action.</p><pre><code>package main

    <section>
      

<p><em>Aug 1, 2019: Updated for clarity based on the great community feedback, special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/x0rg">Raffaele Di Fazio</a>.</em></p>

<p>Understanding the various components and overall system design of Kubernetes is not an easy task. This is partially due to the designers of Kubernetes fully embracing a microservices based architecture. I.e. every piece of the <em>control (“masters”) and data plane (“nodes/workers”)</em> is implemented as distinct services (controllers). Major advantages of this architecture are flexibility and independence in development/deployment, horizontal scalability and failure tolerance, i.e. running two or more (typically n+1) instances of critical processes like etcd, scheduler, API server, etc.</p>

<p>The following diagram from the Kubernetes docs shows the various components. You can read more about that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/">here</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.mgasch.com/images/k8s-arch.png" alt="Kubernetes Architecture - Source: Kubernetes.io"></center>

<p>The downside is that such a microservices based architecture always comes with a steep learning curve. But this knowledge is critical for both, developers and operators, maintaining Kubernetes or developing workloads on top of it. It’s a distributed system par excellence. In my engagements with customers, colleagues and with the community I dedicate a lot of time going into the details of how Kubernetes works. Because across the board, there is often confusion or misunderstanding of the architecture, opening the door for unnecessary discussions or, even worse, failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.”</em></p>

<p>Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized that just by describing the individual components and adding some buzzword-magic like “choreography”, “controllers”, “stateless” and “leader election” does not always make it easier to understand what’s going on and how Kubernetes delivers on the aforementioned promises of a microservices based design.</p>

<p>If I would have to describe Kubernetes in one sentence it would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Autonomous processes reacting to events from the API server”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These <em>processes</em> are modeled as <em>control loops</em> (observe-&gt;analyze-&gt;act<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>) and <strong>only communicate</strong> with the API server, i.e. never directly with each other. An <em>event</em> is simply an immutable fact that happened, e.g. “pod created”. This is also referred to as <em>event-driven architecture</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> where the flow between the individual components (microservices) is a choreography without a central orchestrator.</p>

<p>While working on another (long overdue) blog post I had to create an event-workflow diagram, using the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. In order to not let wait my followers, I did a short tweet on how I think of and explain Kubernetes. Dear lord, did that thing go viral! It certainly hit a nerve.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I see a lot of people having problems to understand how the Kubernetes platform works at the fundamental level, e.g. resiliency and behaviour. If you start thinking about Kubernetes as a fully event-driven system, there's answers to so many "Why"'s <a href="https://t.co/fwPO9XX7zk">pic.twitter.com/fwPO9XX7zk</a></p>— Michael Gasch (@embano1) <a href="https://twitter.com/embano1/status/1067537816324845569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

</center>

<p>Many of you have asked for a blog post (and even Kubecon talk!) on this. So here’s what I wrote in a more readable and Google Search friendly way.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-understand-kubernetes">How I understand Kubernetes</h2>

<p>Think of the API server as a broker with multiple <em>immutable (replicated) logs</em> (or queues)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, each representing a stream of events. Events are facts that can be causally related (<em>happened-before</em>) or not related at all (then we say they happened <em>concurrently</em>). <em>etcd</em> is important for the durability of events, but an implementation detail.</p>

<p>All processes (controllers), e.g. the scheduler, deployment controller, endpoint controller, Kubelet, etc. can be understood as <em>producers and/or consumers</em> of events from these logs (consumers can be producers as well, and vice versa).</p>

<p>Consumers specify the objects (and optionally namespace) they want to receive events from the API server. This is called a <em>ListWatch</em> in Kubernetes: list all events from the API server when the consumer starts, then switch to “watch mode” (triggered by new events) to reduce the load on the API server. Think of the combination of object+namespace as a dedicated (virtual) event queue the API server handles. As each event carries a resource version for the particular object it contains, e.g. a pod object, going back in time (time travel) is actually possible by requesting a specific resource version (and not seldom the cause of tricky bugs in Kubernetes<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Consumers and producers don’t know about each other as they’re fully decoupled (by the queue) and autonomous. This makes the whole system extremely scalable, robust and extensible (adaptable to change).</p>

<p>Thus, by design, it’s a fully <em>asynchronous and eventually consistent</em> platform. Information takes time to propagate from producers(s) to consumers(s). The diagram below shows this where the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler hasn’t caught up with the events coming from the metrics server, which also affects the downstream chain of producers and consumers in our example.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.mgasch.com/images/k8s-api-server-queues.png" alt="Kubernetes API Server - Source: Kubernetes.io"></center>

<p>There’s NO guarantee that the system will converge to the desired state (even if you got an “OK”/ACK from the control plane). For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl scale &lt;deploy&gt; --replicas &lt;n&gt; # where sum(cpu_requests) &gt; cluster_capacity
Scaled deployment &lt;deploy&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the control plane is running fine, you’ll get a HTTP 200 return code, i.e. “OK”, even though there is no remaining capacity in the cluster<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. Marko Luksa put together another great example<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> of some unwanted <em>race conditions</em> between controllers when scaling down services.</p>

<p>Controllers essentially are <em>stateless</em> even though they perform stateful operations, e.g. the scheduler which tracks and recalculates node capacity on every pod scheduled. For efficiency and speed, received events are placed in in-memory caches or local queues in each controller. But what happens to our (local) state if a controller crashes as it does not persist state locally?</p>

<p>Persistency in the controller is not needed! The event-driven design will replay all (appropriate) events when the controller (re)starts, similar to the concept of <em>event-sourcing</em><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>. This property is also very useful as events from the API server are delivered <em>at most once</em>, i.e. could be lost during transmission. Another intrinsic property for increased robustness: Kubernetes is said to be <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/thockin/edge-vs-level-triggered-logic"><em>level-triggered</em></a>. If an event gets lost during transmission (e.g. network issue) or your controller misses events during downtime, the next time there’s a (re-)sync it’s going to receive the complete desired state for that object from the API server. I described how reconciliation works in the scheduler <a href="https://www.mgasch.com/post/sched-reconcile/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since information can get delivered more than once (e.g. after failure, re-sync, etc.) and controllers don’t talk to each other directly, there’s a potential for race conditions when state is to be changed, e.g. a write to same object from different controllers. This is called <em>optimistic concurrency</em> and needs to be handled in the application layer (i.e. in each controller logic). <em>Idempotency and compare and set with retries</em> (based on monotonically increasing resource versions) are patterns used to address this<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Event-driven design has many more advantages and can address a lot of problems in distributed systems, most importantly temporal and spatial decoupling with queuing/buffering, applying back-pressure, event replay for auditing/debugging, etc. However, it’s not a new idea. Not at all! For example, relational databases work the same way (transaction log). The database is said to be the (stale) cache of the immutable log 😄. If you want to learn more about event-driven design, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDey1GoAJy0">this video</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/jboner">Jonas Boner</a>.</p>

<p>Building systems using events as a first class citizen is not specific to computer science. Events are the reason for all being. Without events, there would be no change! What is time anyways? Think about it, it’s an applied and battle-tested design in nature and can easily become a very long philosophical discussion…For the curious in you take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CloserToTruth1">Closer to Truth</a> science channel on Youtube.</p>

<p>Btw: <a href="https://www.mgasch.com/post/k8sevents/@the_sttts">Stefan Schimanski</a> and <a href="https://www.mgasch.com/post/k8sevents/@mhausenblas">Michael Hausenblas</a> have written a <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/kubernetes-deep-dive-api-server-part-1/">great series</a> of how the API server actually is implemented.

<p>I was so happy to see all the great responses from the community and never thought of how this tweet could reach almost 100k people (according to Twitter stats) in less than a week. Thank you!</p>

<p>The VS Code extension is called <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsteenman.cloudformation-yaml-snippets">CloudFormation Snippets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1609169841104/D0jbNT27a.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="cloudformation-snippets.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><strong>The VS Code extension contains the following features:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Autocompletion for every CloudFormation resource type (including properties).</li>
<li>Support for Intrinsic functions &amp; Conditions.</li>
<li>Contains a whole bunch of Parameter types.</li>
<li>Use <code>Tab</code> to quickly update the property of a CloudFormation resource type.</li>
<li>The description of every resource type contains a reference to the official documentation.</li>
<li>Github actions will automatically trigger the pipeline and fetch the latest updates from the official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html">AWS CloudFormation resource specification</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Here is a small demo that shows what happens when you're trying to add a new CloudFormation resource with the VS Code extension enabled:</p>

<p><strong>Steps described in further detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1. Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsteenman.cloudformation-yaml-snippets">extension</a> in your VS Code editor</li>
<li>Step 2. Create a template file in <code>.yml</code> format to start working on CloudFormation</li>
<li>Step 3. Make sure that the file type is listed as <code>YAML</code> in the VS Code editor (Bottom right-hand corner).</li>
<li>Step 4. Type <code>cfn</code> to get the CloudFormation template fragment.</li>
<li>Step 5. Start adding resources in the resource section of the template by using the prefix name e.g. <code>autoscaling-autoscalinggroup</code> equals resource type <code>AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the autocomplete doesn't get invoked automatically in step 5. Then you can invoke IntelliSense manually by pressing <code>ctrl + space</code>. Search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I’ve been surprised by how often I get a response from people I consider “famous”. A few examples.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://feld.com/">Brad Feld</a>, a well known venture capitalist, was willing to do a sixty minute AMA for the Boulder Ruby group. (If you want to watch the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrCMZGOvNgo&amp;feature=youtu.be">it was recorded</a>.)</li><li>I asked a question of Patrick McKenzie years ago about whether I should write a book about testing ETL jobs with Pentaho Kettle. (Short answer: no.)</li><li>The <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/tag/guest-post/">guest posts</a> on this blog.</li></ul>



<p>How can you get help from someone prominent? I’m going to assume that you have someone in mind who you want to ask a question or otherwise get help from. Let’s say you are working on a post about React and you want someone to give it a review to make sure you are on the right path.</p>



<p>Find out more about the person. This involves some research, because you want to ask them for help on a topic they are interested in. Many people have profiles online, so review them to tune your “ask”. Google plus social media is your friend here. You don’t have to do exhaustive investigation, but if you can tune your question to their interests, you are more likely to get a response. It can also really help if you reference anything they’ve shared that is relevant to the question. If they recently posted about Redux and how it is awful, mention that you’ve read it and make an intelligent comment about their argument.</p>



<p>Next, get their contact info, or find it. So you need to do some more research. Lots of people make their email addresses known; that’s a good signal that they want to respond to email. I’ve had some luck with Twitter direct messages, Slack DMs, and LinkedIn messages. I’ve not had luck with public outreach (<code>@</code>ing someone on Twitter, for example). Find out how this person responds to others. I haven’t run into this, but I suspect there are certain people for whom Youtube comments, Tiktok messages, or Twitch DMs are the best form of contact.</p>



<p>Interact with this person before you make the ask. Follow them on Twitter. Share one of their posts to an online community. Comment on their blog. If they write a newsletter, subscribe to it. Even better, respond to one of their newsletters; even if someone has 10,000 subscribers, the number of email replies they receive is for each email is nowhere near that number. If you respond with a cogent comment, you’ll begin to build a relationship with them. Put in some work and you’ll also have a better idea if they are even the right person to ask.</p>



<p>Make sure your request is reasonable. Asking for feedback on your post is fair. Asking for 30 minutes of face to face video chat to discuss ideas is less so. Requesting someone promote your post to their followers is lame. </p>



<p>When you make the request, make it easy for them to both understand what you are requesting, the timeline, and the means of fulfilling the request. Here’s a good request:</p>



<blockquote><p>Hiya &lt;name&gt;,</p><p>Would you be interested in  reviewing my blog post about React deployment strategies? I have a blog focused on React front end development.</p><p>I was thinking that something on this topic might be up your alley. I saw your rant on Redux on Twitter and thought it had some great points. But one thing I wasn’t clear about: Redux sucks, but what is the alternative?</p><p>I’m looking to get this blog post published in the next week. If you are interested, I’ll send you a google doc (unless you would rather some other format; let me know). If not, no worries, and thanks for sharing your thoughts on React! I have learned a lot.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Dan</p></blockquote>



<p>In this note, I have a single, reasonable request. I outline the timeframe; this makes it easy for the recipient to determine if they can possibly fulfill it. I let them know that I know who they are and their opinion on this technology, as well as that I’ve actually read and understood some of their opinions. It’s also important to make it easy for people. Google docs work for a lot of people for reviewing documents, but not everyone. </p>



<p>What a note like this does is encapsulate everything that this person might need to know about the request. There’s no back and forth about when the review would need to be finished. This makes the decision easier, which is what you, as the asker, should aim for.</p>



<p>Pick people at the right level of prominence. Don’t ask the creator of React to review a basic blog post. But if you saw someone speak at a local meetup about React, they’d be a good choice for this request. If, on the other hand, you’ve written an in-depth piece about the performance of React deployments in various scenarios and haven’t seen anything else like it, that might of more interest to someone more prominent, possibly even the creator. As long as you are thoughtful in your request, asking prominent, even famous, people is fine. I’ve been surprised at who has replied to my requests.</p>



<p>Next, follow up once or twice, but don’t bug them. The more prominent the person, the more they are pinged. (This is another reason to ask someone less prominent; they’re more likely to respond.) I always follow up a week later. Give them plenty of chances to say no. I always like to say “feel free to tell me to buzz off if this won’t work for you now.” But don’t give up after sending just one message; we all deal with overflowing inboxes. Patrick replied in 24 hours; Brad responded quickly but it took months to have schedules line up. If they say no, you can thank them, ask for a referral to someone else who might be able to help, or ask if you can follow up in a few months. </p>



<p>Finally, if they say yes, make sure you follow through on the request. For the React blog post example, make sure you send them the google doc, incorporate their feedback, and publish it. Send it to them with a note of thanks after you’re done. This completes the loop and lets them know you didn’t waste their time. </p>



<p>Asking someone prominent to help you out is not as hard as it sounds. Make sure you do your research, make a thoughtful request, and follow up. Not everyone can help, but some definitely will.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

    <p>Sometimes you may want to remove a Postgres user’s password altogether. You may

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So there's this paper, <em>Incentives and Creativity: Evidence from the academic life sciences</em> (Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Manso <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00140.x">2011</a>) that shows that Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators (who are funded for a longer term and in a more open ended way) outperform those of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that have shorter review cycles and more concrete grant proposals. This is seen as a vindication of the "<a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1141118605985308674">fund people, not projects</a>" paradigm. However, the effect sample reported is <em>huge</em> , perhaps too good to be true, and the extent to which this model can scale is debatable, as Azoulay himself also <a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1318578977527668736">says</a> that <em>it is not clear how well this model can scale. HHMI is very much focused on a narrow elite</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, while science generates much of our prosperity, scientists and researchers themselves do not sufficiently obsess over how it should be organized. In a recent paper, Pierre Azoulay and co-authors <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466">concluded</a> that <strong>Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s long-term grants to high-potential scientists made those scientists 96 percent more likely to produce breakthrough work</strong>. If this finding is borne out, it suggests that present funding mechanisms are likely to be far from optimal, in part because they do not focus enough on research autonomy and risk taking. (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">We need a new science of progress</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[1]. There are other NIH similar grants like the MERIT award or the Outstanding Investigator Award (R35)
</p>
<p>NIH has their own HHMI-style throw-money-at-the-best program, the Director's Pioneer award (DP1)<sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup> which also seems to produce <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/HRHR%20PA%20FY%202004-2006%20Outcome%20Evaluation.pdf">great</a> <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/CoC-051413-Pioneer-Award-Program-DP1.pdf">results</a>. <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer">DP1</a> grants are similar to the HHMI Investigators program (700k per year vs ~1M at HHMI) and as selective (11 pioneers per year vs 20 for HHMI). They are not as long-lasting as the HHMI ones however in that they last for 5 years while HHMIs enjoy a theoretical 7 and a practical 15 years of funding. </p>
<p>Both have been lauded as exemplary programs that <em>cause more good science to happen that otherwise would not</em>.</p>
<p>So this seems like an important "huge if true" fact. Even if, as Azoulay suspects, this model cannot scale, it is reasonable to think that the scientific elite that would benefit from this class of funding is comprised of more than the current 250 HHMI investigators and 50 or so DP1 awardees.</p>
<p>So with this setup, let's look at first the general question (people, not projects) and then the specifics of NIH and the HHMI once we have a framework to assess them.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-projects">Fund People, not projects</h2>
<p>The usual way grants are allocated is a process whereby a scientist says they want to do specific piece of work X and then they get money to do that. In <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">practice</a>, researchers have already done part of what they say they will do (And use that data to support the application), and will use part of the funds to work on other things they may want to work on so they can do as they please with <em>part</em> of their time and money. But for the most part, they are working on what they say they are working on. R01 grants, the bulk of NIH's funding, run for 5 years (And this has gone <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2013/11/07/how-long-is-an-r01/">up</a> over time), not too dissimilar, at first glance, to the HHMI's 7.</p>
<p>With DP1 and HHMI, researchers do not submit a grant proposal for something specific they want to do, they submit their resume and a <strong>broad summary of what they are going to be working on</strong>. This research program (3k words) is shorter than a usual Nintil blogpost, and substantially shorter than one of the sample R01 grant applications from the NIAD's <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1-R01-AI121500-01A1_Gordon_Application.pdf">website</a> which are over 5x longer (excluding references and CVs). </p>
<p>
[2]. Azoulay et al. 2011 states that 'Moreover, HHMI investigators appear to share the perception that their first appointment review is rather lax, with reviewers more interested in making sure that they have taken on new projects with uncertain payoffs, rather than insisting on achievements. Below, we validate this perception by showing that the second review is much more sensitive to performance than the first.'
</p>
<p>Both are similar in that they can be renewed; if one wants to work on a 20 year project, in theory one can roll the <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/apply-renewal">same</a> R01 four times, with the <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/02/16/are-attempts-at-renewal-successful/">likelihood</a> of being renewed starting at 30%. HHMI is more forgiving once one is in and in the event one is out: it provides <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">two years of phase-out</a> if a renewal is not successful and the renewal rate is &gt;80% anyway, leading to a median of 16 years of <a href="https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1208442925249630209">support</a><sup><a href="#sidenote-2">2</a></sup>. Thus HHMI investigators can expect to be funded for longer, and because if they lose funding they don't have to be immediately looking for support, that should also help keep their eyes in the long term. This is not to say that HHMI investigators do not spend time applying for grants, you can search <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm">here</a> for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Zhang">Feng Zhang</a> (HHMI since 2018) and see that he got a DP1 in 2020 as well as R01s in 2020 and 2019. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Anderson">David J. Anderson</a> (HHMI since 1989) can be seen applying for R01s in the same site. This is because the HHMI award, generous as it is, covers the investigator's salary, some research budget, special expenses for expensive equipment, but not every expense, and not the hiring of additional lab members.</p>
<p>There are other differences, HHMI <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">requires</a> researchers to spend 75% of their time doing research, whereas in R01s there is no such limit. DP1s are required to work half of their time on grant-related research.</p>
<p>This brief discussion is just to highlight that the "fund people, not projects" approach, even when looked at by using their usual life sciencesexemplars, is not as clear cut as it may seem. It may be more useful to consider two extreme idealized approaches instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund projects: A scientist proposes to do a specific, well defined project. There is an expected deliverable and there may be milestones involved that have to be met. Rather then being open ended and highly uncertain, it is roughly known to be achievable. The project should be ended if it's not meeting its goals.</li>
<li>Fund people: A scientist is funded generously and have all their requirements for assistants and equipment met without paperwork or further reviews. They have zero accountability, and what they decide to research or publish has no bearing on the continuation of funding. In effect they have life tenure. They don't perish if they don't publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches; they are the explore/exploit tradeoff with another name. The first one is similar to the <a href="https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine">Focused Research Organization</a> concept.</p>
<p>The second one sounds like tenure. But modern day tenure is not generally like this. Scientists are <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/37986/is-it-possible-to-survive-in-university-academia-without-applying-for-grants">expected to continue to apply</a> for grants and bring money to the university (The university gets a cut), as well as to grow their lab; in turn as they now have a lab they have some obligation to their students, who do need to publish in high impact journals in order to get ahead in academia. Tenure pays just the salay (and 9 months of it in the case of US tenure, as the other 3 are expected to be covered with grants). It does not cover the cost of any materials employed during the course of research, or the salaries of research assistants (Those also have to come from grants). </p>
<p>Donald Braben <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">points out</a> that before 1970 (or so)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tenured academics with an individual turn of mind could usually dig out modest sources of funding to tackle any problem that interested them without first having to commit themselves in writing. Afterward, unconditional sources of funds would become increasingly diffi cult to find. Today, they are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>The way forward for ambitious young researchers was once clear, therefore. All they had to do was to acquire the necessary qualifications, and then to find a tenured appointment. To say the least, that was not easy, but not substantially more difficult than it would be today. However, having served their apprenticeship, they were free. They may have had to overcome the inevitable peer pressure if their plans were controversial, but their peers did not have power of veto— see Poster 1 .Written applications were necessary if expensive equipment or large teams were required, but tenured researchers with modest needs would meet few obstacles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still sounds like modern day tenure! What has changed is that <em>if</em> more expensive equipment is now required (And this is most likely true in the life sciences than in theoretical physics) and that in turn requires grants, then academics now have that additional potential veto in a way that the cheaper experiments of the past did not have. And Braben can't argue that the new system selects for people that are good at getting grants. In the quote above he concedes that getting tenure was as hard back then; and plausibly to get tenure you needed the same things you do today.</p>
<p>The ones that come close to the "fund people" approach are not HHMI investigators, or the pre-1970 scientific community; those would be the self-funded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist">independent scientists</a> that were wealthy enough to be able to do anything they wanted. Alfred Loomis' story in particular, how he managed to have the best equipped lab in the US, paid out of his Wall Street profits, seems the closest to the platonic form of the fund people approach.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-metrics">Fund people, not metrics?</h2>
<p>Another distinction to be made here beyond people vs projects is <em>how</em> people or projects are selected. One can use impersonal metrics or one can get more personal and, eschew all bureaucracy and process and go full <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewclifford/status/1326479506983579648">nepotistic</a>. Though not intrinsically tied to "fund people", it is true that those approaches have historically been more linked to a personal approach. Ioannidis (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/477529a">2011</a>) discusses various "fund people" approaches which include using mechanisms like lotteries or just funding everyone. This is one of the two missing sectors of the 2x2 quadrant (In red, missing):</p>

<p>In the HHMI process, a scientist get personally interviewed in the later stages of being funded. For R01s, there is a committee (a study section) that one will never see or meet. The Rockefeller foundation (post WWII) took it to an even more extreme …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>December 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/the-easy-ones-three-bugs-hiding-in-the-open/">The Easy Ones â€“ Three Bugs Hiding in the Open</a>,
Bruce Dawson gave us a little C puzzle in passing:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h">variable arguments</a> in
printf formatting means that it is easy to get type mismatches. The
practical results vary considerably:</p>

<ol><li>printf(â€œ0x%08lxâ€�, p); // Printing a pointer as an int â€“ truncation or worse on 64-bit </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%d, %fâ€�, f, i); // Swapping float and int â€“ could print nonsense, or might actually work (!) </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%s %dâ€�, i, s); // Swapping the order of string and int â€“ will probably crash</li>
</ol>

<p>[...] (aside: understanding why #2 often
prints the desired result is a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> puzzle)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to think about this for a bit, and then I realized why and
how it can work (and why similar integer versus float argument
confusion can also work for other functions, even ones with fixed
argument lists). What it comes down to is that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a>s,
arguments are passed in registers (at least early arguments, before
you run out of registers), and <strong>floating point arguments are passed
in different registers than integers (and pointers)</strong>.  This is
true even for functions that take variable arguments and will walk
through them using stdarg macros (or at least it can be, depending
on the ABI).</p>

<p>Because floating point and non floating point arguments are passed
in different sets of registers, what matters isn't the total order
of arguments but the order of floating point or non-fp arguments.
So here, regardless of where '%f' is in the printf format, it always
causes printf() to get the first floating point argument, which can
never be confused with an integer argument. Similarly, the first
'%d' causes printf() to look for the second non-fp argument,
regardless of where it was in the argument order; it could be at
the end of several floating point arguments and still work.</p>

<p>(The '%d' makes printf() look for the second non-fp argument because
the first one was the format string. In an ABI that passed pointers
in a separate place than integers, it would still work out, since now
the first '%d' would be looking for the first integer argument.)</p>

<p>Using the excellent services of godbolt.org, we can see this in
action on 64-bit x86 in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hYz9Gn">a very small example</a> (I used a very small example and a
decent optimization level to get clear, minimal assembly code). The
floating point argument is passed in <code>xmm0</code>, while the format string
and the integer argument are passed in <code>edi</code> and <code>esi</code> respectively
(I don't know what <code>eax</code> is doing, but it probably has something
to do with the ABI). A similar thing happens on 64-bit ARM v8 (aka
Aarch64), as we can also see on godbolt with <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jrxz96">the same example on
Aarch64</a>.</p>

<p>(Based on <a href="https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/AArch64_Register_and_Instruction_Quick_Start">this page</a>,
the Aarch64 <code>x0</code> and <code>w1</code> are in the same set of registers. Apparently
<code>d0</code> is a 64-bit version of the first floating point register, from
<a href="https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/pdf/graphics-and-multimedia/ARMv8_InstructionSetOverview.pdf">here</a>
[pdf]. I wound up looking up all of this to be sure I understood
what was going on in the Aarch64 call, so I might as well write it
down here.)</p>

<p>Since pointers and integers are normally passed in the same set of
registers (at least on 64-bit x86 and Aarch64), we can also see why
the third example is very likely to fail. Since the same set of
registers is used for both argument types, it's possible to use an
integer argument as a pointer argument, with a segmentation fault
as the likely result. Similarly, we can predict that '<code>printf("%s
%f", f, s);</code>' might well work.</p>

<p>PS: This confusion can happen in any language that follows the C
ABI on a platform with this sort of split usage of registers (although
many languages may prevent this sort of argument type confusion).
Not all languages do; famously, Go currently passes all arguments
on the stack (as of Go 1.15 and soon Go 1.16).</p>

            <p>In this mini-book, you will(hopefully) learn about different neural network structures. By the end of the book,
                I hope you also will have a solid conceptual understanding of how neural networks function.</p><p>I will briefly go through some necessary formulas and equations, but will mainly
                stick to broad definitions that are comprehendible to even middle school students(I’ll try!). Some topics are well
                beyond those taught in middle school, so you may want to look at more thorough and step-by-step walkthroughs on the
                topics on platforms like <a rel="noopener" href="https://khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>.
                As you go through this book, you will also encounter several different projects and real-world problems that I will
                walk you through and solve. I highly recommend you take a try at solving them beforehand! Solutions that I give may
                not be the best and most state-of-the-art, so you can also try and tweak it a bit to make it better! I will try to
                add some optimizations to the code to make it faster and more efficient and give you a summary of what state-of-the-art
                methods data scientists now use. All code in this book is either pseudocode or written in Java, so you should be able to
                roughly interpret it if you have learned any C-like programming languages! You don’t need to learn one right away to
                continue reading either… I provide detailed explanations of each line of code. You can also find it all on
                <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (with this book).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>We are using selenium (with help of <a href="http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/">behat</a>) quite a lot.
When test failed we had problem to debug it. And running all tests on our local machines is taking about 60min. We have parallel test suites in jenkins so it takes less than 10min so we are using jenkins to run tests for every commit we push to our git repository.
First we were taking screenshots of every step but Behat v3.0 doesnâ€™t have option to run step within step and writing each step in gherkin is not the way we want to pursue, we would like to write more business focused tests.</p>
<p>My friend read about <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/pyvnc2swf.html">pyvnc2swf</a> in â€œ<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a>â€�.</p>
<p>The idea was so simple and genious that I started to look for options to record sessions which would save us time with debugging problems.
First I tried to use <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/pyvnc2swf.html">pyvnc2swf</a> but this is quite old software. So I started to read about options of Xvfb.</p>
<p>My first dicovery was that Xvfb can listen for remote connections. So I could easily start Xvfb running selenium:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">xvfb-run <span>--listen-tcp</span> <span>--server-num</span> 44 <span>--auth-file</span> /tmp/xvfb.auth <span>-s</span> <span>"-ac -screen 0 1920x1080x24"</span> java <span>-jar</span> selenium.jar</code></pre></figure>
<p><code>--server-num</code> is the option to set what is the â€œdisplay idâ€� which is used in next step.</p>
<p>With this I started to search for informations â€œhow to record X sessions with ffmpegâ€�. And to my surprise <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> has the <code>x11grab</code> option. And I was even more surprised when it started to do this over IP. So now I can start to record when job with behat is running. Some additional switches and stuff and I had movie in 12fps (cause this is not a movie and I donâ€™t need silky smooth fps rate).</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ffmpeg <span>-f</span> x11grab <span>-video_size</span> 1920x1080 <span>-i</span> 127.0.0.1:44 <span>-codec</span>:v libx264 <span>-r</span> 12 /tmp/behat_1.mp4</code></pre></figure>
<p>The <code>-i</code> flag is setting up which display to use from which server. I have 6 builds running in paralel and theyâ€™re using different displays to see what is happening.</p>
<p>The last problem I had was with properly quitting ffmpeg when the recording was done.
<code>kill</code> command would kill the process but the information about video length wasnâ€™t correctly saved to container. This made seeking through video problematic.
To quit <code>ffmpeg</code> properly I had to send <code>q</code> keystroke to ffmpeg process.</p>
<p>This is the place where <a href="https://tmux.github.io/"><code>tmux</code></a> saves the day.
I had to start detached session with <code>tmux</code> running <code>ffmpeg</code> and name session so I knew where to send the keystroke when the build was ending.</p>
<p>So when the build is starting Iâ€™m starting tmux with ffmpeg recording</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">tmux new-session <span>-d</span> <span>-s</span> BehatRecording1 <span>'ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -i 192.168.102.1:44 -codec:v libx264 -r 12 /tmp/behat_1.mp4'</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And when the build is finishing (no matter if tests are succesfull or not) Iâ€™m sending <code>q</code> to that session with:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">tmux send-keys <span>-t</span> BehatRecording1 q</code></pre></figure>

			<p><strong>PSY 607: Everything is Fucked</strong><br>
Prof. Sanjay Srivastava<br>
Class meetings: Mondays 9:00 – 10:50 in 257 Straub<br>
Office hours: Held on Twitter at your convenience (<a href="http://twitter.com/hardsci" target="_blank">@hardsci</a>)</p>
<p>In a much-discussed article at Slate, social psychologist Michael Inzlicht told a reporter, “Meta-analyses are fucked” (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html" target="_blank">Engber, 2016</a>). What does it mean, in science, for something to be fucked? Fucked needs&nbsp;to mean more than that something is complicated or must be undertaken with thought and care, as that would be trivially true of everything in science. In this class we will go a step further and say that something is fucked if it presents hard conceptual challenges to which implementable,&nbsp;real-world solutions for working scientists are either not available or routinely ignored in practice.</p>
<p>The format of this seminar&nbsp;is as follows: Each week we will read and discuss 1-2 papers that raise the question of whether something is fucked. Our focus will be on things that may be fucked in research methods, scientific practice, and philosophy of science. The potential fuckedness of specific theories, research topics, etc. will not be the focus of this class per se, but rather will be used to illustrate these important topics. To that end, each week a different student will be assigned to find a paper that illustrates the fuckedness (or lack thereof) of that week’s topic, and give a 15-minute presentation about whether it is indeed fucked.</p>

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>
  <li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/trinodb">@trinodb</a></li>
  <li>Slack: <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">https://trino.io/slack.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

    <section itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png"><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png" alt="Flow running on a Raspberry Pi 400" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py36 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>82</span><span> seconds

✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py39 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>461</span><span> seconds
</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2
interpreter open, right?</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># Convert the characters in the hostname to hexadecimal.

</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>hostname_as_hexadecimal </span><span>== </span><span>address_without_colons
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:
    </span><span>self._check_packed_address(address, </span><span>16</span><span>)

    self</span><span>._ip </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_int_from_byte_vals(bvs, </span><span>'big'</span><span>)
    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>

Yet." alt="Other" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/Category_Other.png"></a></p><p>The virtual version of the annual CCC Congress is underway and feels like a huge playground. Things are bumpy but the participants are still having fun. Of course, we have IRC as a save heaven. That always works.</p>

<p>The virtual world (which is the only thing the sold out tickets are needed for) is really fun. It feels like debugging a DOS game in the 80/90s. Not much works but it is engaging enough to keep poking at things.</p>

        <p>Today I cleaned up my various projects and todo’s in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. I am always collecting links and resources for potential project ideas, or for general learning. Sometimes, however, it is best to acknowledge that I will likely never have enough free time to even begin some of these endeavors.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>One thing I love about OmniFocus is the concept of “dropping” a project or task, which neither deletes the item nor marks it as complete — a feature sorely lacking in most “Todo” apps. Dropping an item is similar to deletion, but it preserves the record in case you would ever like to return to it. It is removed from view, but you can find it again by searching.</p>

<p>Today I decided to “drop” my compilers project in OmniFocus. I may return to it one day. Maybe not. In any case, I figured others in the community who want to learn about compilers might find these resources valuable. I have only skimmed them, but they should provide a good starting point. I hope you succeed where I did not.</p>

<p>All of these notes (among many others) are also in my <a href="https://github.com/jessesquires/TIL/blob/main/compilers/README.md">TIL repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We all use compilers every day, but they still can seem like a mysterious black box at times. In this try! Swift talk, Samuel Giddins builds a tiny compiler for his made-up language 100% from scratch to get a feel for the basics of how compilers work.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We’re going to start by going over the basic structure of a compiler. Then we’re going to build a lexer and a parser for Kaleidoscope. Then we’re going to take that parse data and we’re going to compile it to LLVM Intermediate Representation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>These are things you can do on your own. I’ve arranged them roughly in order of difficulty and time commitment, although of course the language / environment you pick will affect things.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/tutorial/">LLVM tutorial</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the “Kaleidoscope” Language tutorial, showing how to implement a simple language using LLVM components in C++.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting interpreters</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This book contains everything you need to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. It’s a blast.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It’s a playground explaining how to create a tiny programming language (Mu).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In my Advanced Compilers course last fall we spent some time poking around in the LLVM source tree. A million lines of C++ is pretty daunting but I found this to be an interesting exercise and at least some of the students agreed, so I thought I’d try to write up something similar. We’ll be using LLVM 3.9, but the layout isn’t that different for previous (and probably subsequent) releases.</p>
