<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>

<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg" alt="The picture of a clock to illustrate time we waste when the deploy is slow." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-5dffa44220fae3cb575331fd82a7013a-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou

 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque

<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a0ba2051dedfb653ca45"><div><h3><strong>Building Beauty invites computer professionals to:</strong></h3><p><strong>Work, study, and conduct research with a network of&nbsp;Christopher Alexander’s colleagues and students</strong></p><p>The architect and urbanist Christopher Alexander, and his coworkers, produced a body of insights, practical methods, and research results, which inspired countless movements and products in the computer world -- from <strong>structured programming</strong> to <strong>design patterns</strong>; from the <strong>wiki</strong> to the <strong>sims</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But these were side-effects. His major drive was to understand the <strong>nature of beauty</strong>, and the processes that create life and beauty in nature, so people could make beautiful things.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to build beautifully, and anyone interested in resolving the countless troubles and problems in the world of computing, would benefit from understanding Alexander’s underlying research program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most direct way to do that, and the most engaged approach, is to study the material <strong>with a network of people who worked closely with Christopher Alexander</strong>, and who are continuing to develop his approach to theory and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Building Beauty is an architectural graduate program. Its goal is to provide the opportunity to join this network and pursue this research.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work in <strong>computing</strong>, we invite you to study this material with us in its <strong>original</strong> form, for the<strong> built environment</strong> -- and join in parallel seminars, projects, and conferences to explore a disciplined, rigorous, and authentic recasting of this material, within the world of technology. We will pursue research in the natural sciences and explore the nature of engineering, while growing beautiful projects that move us towards a better world.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Alexander made sure that his colleagues, no matter their background, went through&nbsp; fundamental, practical training on the nature of beauty. We've continued that tradition at the Building Beauty program. Now, in parallel, within our new Beautiful Software initiative, we’ll get everyone up-to-speed regarding ambitious technology that can assist in the spread of beauty. The first lesson is that putting nature, beauty, and feeling in the <strong>center</strong> of processes and practices will engender positive, revolutionary changes in the world we live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The case for beautiful software</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There are <strong>three</strong> strange facts that force us to consider <strong>good</strong> software to be (among other things) <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>, compelling us to examine closely what these mean.&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>People can tell the <strong>difference</strong> between something that is natural -- that is, <strong>not</strong> man-made -- and something that is a human artifact.</p></li><li><p>However it's measured, <strong>nature</strong> makes <strong>more complex</strong> products than we can. Of course, the human species is an 'artifact' of nature, so we can never win that game.</p></li><li><p>Among the products of nature and humans, we judge the <strong>best</strong> to be 'natural and 'beautiful'.</p></li></ol><p>Regarding (1) -- of course it’s possible to fool people: with a photograph, for example. But when we do so, we are merely re-emphasizing that there <strong>is</strong> a perceptual faculty that reacts to impressions of natural structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (2) -- nature produces beauty and adaptation wonderfully. It's enviable. But nature's precise physical and chemical mechanisms are terribly complex and hard to uncover, while the mechanisms behind good software must be clear, consistent, and comprehensible. So why study natural processes? Because nature doesn't only work at a single, low-level scale. Nature works with overlapping layers of means and ends, which we can make immediate use of, it turns out, when we direct our efforts towards beauty and feeling. We don't need to copy nature exactly. We just need to do better, and natural processes provide the clues.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding (3) -- there are many human artifacts and processes, even extremely 'popular', 'successful', and 'productive' ones, that are neither beautiful nor natural. This may be a good indication of a harmful product or process. Things that are popular, dominant, and stimulating are not necessarily good. But, unfortunately, by habit, and power projection through our society, bad results are often called 'best practices'. Learning to question dogmas is one of the most important skills one can develop in life and in the sciences -- along with an ability to piece together theories that displace the dogmas. This process of enlightenment, in the broad sense, should never end.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, even the most beautiful and natural software will do harm if it was not created freely and cooperatively, for the purpose of healing and helping people and nature. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is rarely practiced in the creation of any technology, but we need it: we won't survive unless we become truly, doggedly responsible.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll be examining these ideas and practices in our seminars and projects. <strong>You are all invited.</strong></p><p><strong>To express your interest in joining us, please write to </strong><a href="mailto:software@buildingbeauty.org"><strong>software@buildingbeauty.org</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

					<div><p>I have a strange relationship with hypomania. I LOVE IT but I know that what goes up must come down and when it comes down it <span><strong>REALLY</strong></span> comes down. And the next time is even worse than the last. The relief of coming out of depression and speeding towards hypomania is magical. Waking up and jumping out of bed, rushing to get dressed so I can go outside. So I can experience the sun on my skin, the air is fresh and the grass is greener than I remember. Everything is great. I want to share my happiness with my friends, family and the world. I laugh harder than I have ever laughed before. I very rarely wear make-up but when I’m hypomanic I absolutely must. I’m confident in every aspect of life. I even love going to work. I have the best ideas. I could definitely do that. My taste in music changes I’m forever searching for an up-beat song that has a fast beat that I can sing to, dance to. I’ll skip 100’s of songs until I find the one and when I do it’s AMAZING.</p><p>In social situations during a hypomanic episode you’ll often find me surrounded by people. I love talking and I love listening. People tend to be really drawn to me when I’m like this because I’m fun to be around and I make them laugh. I often go days with barely any sleep. I don’t need it. I don’t need to eat either.&nbsp; I can sleep when I’m dead, eating is a distraction from what I want to be doing and I have lots of things that I want to do. Sounds great right? How is this even considered a mental illness? Let me tell you… During this episodes one of my symptoms is hypersexuality.</p><blockquote><p><span><strong>Hypersexuality</strong></span> is defined as an increased need or pressure for sexual gratification. It can often be a symptom of mania, and may also include decreased inhibitions or a need for forbidden sex.</p></blockquote><p>For me I become preoccupied with the thought of having sex and I’ll pursue someone hard. Not just with my partner at the time but anyone who takes my eye. In fact, I don’t even need to feel that attracted to them. The thrill of flirting, the thrill of making them want me is my objective. I consider myself a straight female (Though I have had sexual encounters with women in the past) but it doesn’t matter. I’ll flirt and have sex with women too. I don’t want or need it to be intimate. It’s an hedonistic, animalistic desire to have sex. And if I don’t get it? It pisses me off. This again probably doesn’t sound like the end of the world does it? But what if you’re flirting and perusing your boss? A married man or you’re in a relationship yourself? Not so funny when it can fuck up your life and other peoples. </p><p>This behaviour has led me into dangerous situations. I have been sexually assaulted numerous times and now what would be defined as rape. At the time I had no awareness that it was. For this reason amongst others I never reported it. Victim blaming is prevelant in society. I saw it as me putting myself in a&nbsp; situation where it could happen, thus it was my own fault.</p><p>Reflecting on my teenage years I can now really see that hypomania was very present. After my dad died when I was 16. I stopped turning up at school I made friends with people much older than me. Many of them I’m still friends with and they really are great friends.&nbsp; But during this period of my life I ended up using recreational drugs EVERY weekend, ALL weekend.&nbsp; Not just a bit of weed but ecstasy and cocaine whilst drinking heavily too. Sometimes I took all of those drugs on the same night. I remember the day I turned 18. Finishing work, the guy I worked with (also my best friend at the time) handed me some money to buy ecstasy for the party were planning to have. I walked into my Mum’s house filled with family there to wish me happy birthday. I stood there and chatted to them, the whole time I had 200 ecstasy tablets in the front pocket of my hoody. I didn’t care. I didn’t care that taking one of those ecstasy tablets could have killed me. Because it wouldn’t would it? I’m indestructible. I’m having so much fun. Life is great.</p><p>If all that hasn’t persuaded you that hypomania is a bad thing… What about the racing thoughts? The irritation that consumes you and the full-blown anger that comes because of it? I’ve lost friends and I’ve upset people because something relatively minor has pissed me off and I have completely lost self-control. I can’t control what comes out of my mouth, I don’t have the restraint or the ability to filter what I say. I’ve thrown things, I’ve smashed things. I’ve screamed, caught my breath and screamed again.&nbsp; I’ve promised to do impossible tasks. I’ve spent money I didn’t have because I wanted, no needed those clothes,shoes and that new laptop. I have at least 15 bottles of shampoo in my bathroom, drawers full of make-up all that I very rarely use. The result of a hypomanic episode.</p><p>During some episodes the “fun bit” hasn’t come. Sometimes hypomania for me has had more psychotic and paranoid features such as hearing voices talking about me. My anxiety increases beyond its normal threshold to the point I have panic attacks. I can feel my heart beating so fast that it feels like it’s going to come out of my chest. I shake uncontrollably. And have lost control of my bladder. Yes I’ve actualIy pissed myself fully clothed where I stand. I can actually see my thoughts swirling around above my head so fast that they I can barely read them. I’ve found myself putting my hands over my head and squeezing just to get some sort of relief. Hypomania at some points has led to me trying to, or wanting to kill myself. Not so fun now is it? It’s hard not to get addicted to the euphoria of hypomania. I try to remind myself that there are very real consequences to these episodes when I consider not taking my medication just to feel that euphoria again.</p><p>When it’s all over I’m left to pick up the pieces, to fix (if they are even fixable) the stupid shit I’ve done. Hypomania isn’t fun when it’s over. The depression that comes after hypomania is possibly the worst type of depression. My mind is broken and so is my body. The embarrassment of my behaviour after some of these episodes is awful. I sink lower and lower after every hypomanic episode and it scares me that one day I will really hit the bottom of rock bottom and I’ll never get back out of it. Some of the worst things that have ever happened to me are the result of a hypomanic episode. I’m lucky I’m not dead. Seriously.</p><p>Fortunately, with a combination of medication, psychiatric help and maturing as a person dealing with the depression and hypomania has become easier and I can most of the time diffuse situations or at least deal with the fallout from them better than I have before. &nbsp;Taking diazepam for 7 days at the start of a developing hypomanic episode is necessity for me and can often stop it in its tracks.</p><p>The biggest thing I have learnt after having Bi-Polar is that <span><strong>SLEEP</strong> </span>and <span><strong>STRESS</strong></span> management are key to staying well. When one of those tips the balance, that’s when things start going wrong.</p><p>Although the original idea for this blog was meant to be cathartic release for me. I hope that in some way I can give people a platform to express themselves and the opportunity just to “get it all out” and I hope you feel less alone when reading my posts. Please feel free to engage with me on one of my various social media accounts. Even if it’s just to say Hi or tell me your story.</p><p><img src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" data-src="https://www.barebipolar.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sig1-copy-e1595458758796.png" alt="" width="160" height="76"></p></div>

		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_322570"><p>The Dodo – endemic to Mauritius, made extinct at some unknown point in the late 1600s (Roberts &amp; Solow 2003, Hume <em>et al</em>. 2004, Cheke 2006) – was a giant, flightless pigeon, closely related to Nicobar pigeons (<em>Caloenas</em>) and crowned pigeons (<em>Goura</em>). This affinity is demonstrated by numerous anatomical details (Fjeldså 1976, Janoo 1996, 2000, Livezey &amp; Zusi 2007, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and also by genetics (Shapiro <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2007). Just knowing about the Dodo’s affinities is useful, since there are a few aspects of Dodo anatomy where we can look to its extant relatives for guidance. Example: obvious sexual dimorphism in plumage (at least, visible to the human eye) is not present in those close living relatives.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_123254"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_181526"><div><p>By far the most famous and influential of these are the paintings attributed to Roelandt Savery, in particular the giant 1626 painting which once belonged to writer and artist George Edwards. Supposedly based on a live bird kept in Holland, it’s today at the Natural History Museum, London (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Incidentally, we’re not <em>completely</em> sure that Savery really was the creator of this painting but I will – from hereon – assume that he was for the sake of convenience. A second very famous Savery Dodo painting – this time by Roelandt’s nephew, Jan or Hans Savery – is on show at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and might have been produced in 1631. Regardless, all of these ‘Savery’ Dodo paintings show grey (though read on), chunky, exceedingly bulky, short-legged birds with yellowish wing and tail plumes.</p><p>Despite claims that R. Savery’s 1626 painting was produced from life, it doesn’t match other images which more certainly were and it seems likely that it was based on taxiderm specimens or written accounts. For these reasons it (and other ‘Savery Dodos’) can’t and shouldn’t be taken as providing especially important insights into Dodo appearance or anatomy.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_187214"><div>

The drawings depict both a dead or stunned Dodo laid out on a table as well as one or more live Dodos in standing pose (Kitchener 1993a, Hume 2003, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>). Another Dodo drawing from the early days of Mauritian discovery and exploration is that featured in the Dutch volume <em>Het Tvveede Boeck</em> of 1601. This reported a 1598 expedition led by Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007145721?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0007145721&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Fuller 2002</span></a>, Hume 2006, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish 2013</span></a>) and hence the Dodo featured therein has often been called the Van Neck Dodo. A very influential illustration and account produced by the French naturalist Carolus Clusius in 1605 – it will be referred to a few times in this article – was apparently copied from a drawing in Van Neck’s journal, but the original has been lost.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_43525"><div>

An interesting colour painting produced by Cornelis Saftleven in around 1638 has an air of realism which forces writers like myself to pay attention to it (this might be a trick and it could be worthless), and it also gets mention here. Saftleven’s painting is also unusual in showing the bird in three-quarters view. It’s of unknown provenance and we don’t know if it was based on a live bird.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594456981770_219695"><div>

Mansur illustrated animals for Emperor Jahangir of the Mughul Empire who kept a menagerie at Surat, India; Jahangir’s scientific curiosity led him to order the creation of technically rigorous works which were meant to be as accurate and detailed as possible (Dissanayake 2004). As we’ll see, Mansur’s Dodo is one of the most significant depictions of the species in life. And, yes, it seemingly means that at least one live Dodo was present in an Indian menagerie during the 1620s.</p><p>The Dodos of Van Neck, Clusius and Savery are essentially the ‘originals’ from which virtually all later Dodos were copied, and both Kitchener (1993a) and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0253000998?camp=1634&amp;creativeASIN=0253000998&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=tetrazoolo-21" target="_blank"><span>Parish (2013)</span></a> produced genealogies showing how subsequent artists based their Dodos on those of these artists.

                    <p>Accidents, tragedies, or negative outcomes, all entice a usual reaction: whoâ€™s at fault for this? Who is to blame? Our instinct drives us in that direction. The reasoning seems pretty obvious: if something bad has happened, it must have been because of someone screwed up by being negligent or maybe they were malevolent all along.</p>

<p>However, sometimes thereâ€™s no one we should be blaming. If we think in calm and measured wayâ€”before scapegoatingâ€”it becomes obvious that no oneâ€™s guilty.</p>

<p>I recently saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCfY270l7k">video of killing</a> of Haramabe, a silverback gorilla, by Cincinnati Zoo authorities. The video shows a disoriented, agitated gorilla dragging a toddlerâ€”who had fallen into the enclosure after climbing the 3-foot fenceâ€”with intense force. After deliberating for ten minutes, the Zoo authorities decided to shoot the gorilla. Silverback gorilla is an endangered specie and Harambe was only half-way through his expected lifespan. Naturally, the action invited a ton of angry reactions.</p>

<p>Whoâ€™s to blame?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the zoo authorities. They point out that Harambe wasnâ€™t trying to hurt the child, and a tranquilizer could have been employed instead. The other camp questions the negligence of having a miniature fence.</li>
  <li>Some say itâ€™s the parents (the mother here). For letting the kid out of sight. Many, including prominent stars like Ricky Gervais, have targeted the mother for being an awful parent.</li>
  <li>The more misopedic ones blame the toddler and even question the decision of prioritizing a human life over the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>But thereâ€™s no one to blame if you ascertain all the facts of the case.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Silverback Gorillas are extremely powerful. It could be argued that Harambe didnâ€™t intend to harm the child, but even without effort, Harambe couldâ€™ve seriously hurt him. He was visibly getting more and more upset by the commotion.</li>
  <li>Tranquilizer darts take about ten minutes to work. The gorilla could have potentially injured the child in that time window, especially after being shot at.</li>
  <li>The fence could have been taller, but that only became obvious after the fact. The fence was erected in 1978 and they had no incident of visitors crossing till 2016. Additionally, the zoo passed inspections without being cited even once for the fenceâ€™s height.</li>
  <li>The mother had four kids with her. The toddler skipped fence when she was strapping the other kids to the stroller. Kids, especially if youâ€™ve multiple, canâ€™t be watched 24x7.  Parents are humans, not robots, and they have limited attention span. The fence climbing could have happened in a 10-20 sec window while she was focused on her other kids. (<a href="https://people.com/celebrity/witness-describes-moment-when-4-year-old-climbed-into-gorilla-enclosure/">ref</a>)</li>
  <li>Finally, kids that young are still impervious to dangers of their actions. They are still learning about the world and can unknowingly attempt something very perilous.</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, thereâ€™s no one to blame. It just an unfortunate incident that happened with no one at an obvious fault. You could invoke the moral culpability in keeping animals away from their natural habitat, but that is far removed from the incident.</p>

<hr>

<p>In 2009, Gene Weingarten, touched on a similar subject with his Pulitzer winning story, â€œ<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html">Fatal Distraction</a>.â€� Around 15-25 times a year, a parentâ€”an â€œotherwise loving and attentive parentâ€�â€”forgets a child in the carâ€™s backseat resulting in a tragic death. Such a horrifying mistake would register as  gross neglect to must of us, but we should ask, can our disgust be more than the â€œlifelong sentence of guiltâ€� that the parent has to bear? This isnâ€™t wilful negligence, itâ€™s a mistake like any other.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory is a machine, and it is not flawless. Our conscious mind prioritizes things by importance, but on a cellular level, our memory does not. <strong>If youâ€™re capable of forgetting your cellphone, you are potentially capable of forgetting your child</strong></p>

  <p><em>â€”  David Diamond, professor of molecular physiology, University of South Florida</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The search to blame someone can actually exacerbate the situation as Margarethe Wiersema, professor of management at University of California, observed in her <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/12/holes-at-the-top-why-ceo-firings-backfire">study of CEO firings</a>. Often, because of poor earnings and growth, the board of directors relent under the pressure and dismiss the CEO. However, having a new head doesnâ€™t translate to a turnaround; in fact, the decline could potentially accelerate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typically a CEO gets fired not because the board has thoughtfully and deliberately concluded that itâ€™s time for a change at the top but because investors, concerned about poor performance, demand a change. Board members, who have little idea how to address the underlying problems that got their company into trouble in the first place, seek to appease investors in the short term by handing them the CEOâ€™s head on a platter.</p>

  <p>â€¦</p>

  <p>Company performance relative to industry average failed to improve significantly after bringing in a new CEO. And performance lagged behind that of companies with routine CEO successions. I couldnâ€™t find a single measure suggesting that CEO dismissals have a positive effect on corporate performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">politicianâ€™s syllogism</a> at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We must do something</li>
  <li>This is something</li>
  <li>Therefore, we must do this.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Rather than asking whoâ€™s to blame, the more productive thing is to assess a situation from everyoneâ€™s point of view, understand that humans are fallible, and think what we can do improve the future outcomes. Blame is an easy game, but compassion is harder.</p>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

<p>Join us today!</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://liamhinzman.com/blog/vulkan-fundamentals | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liamhinzman.com/blog/vulkan-fundamentals">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for physical device selection
</b><p><b>(Tip: Read the comments so you don’t get overwhelmed by code) </b></p></summary>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>void</span> pickPhysicalDevice() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>  <span>// Get list of all physical devices that can be found by Vulkan</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>  <span>auto</span> physicalDevices = instance.enumeratePhysicalDevices();</span>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>vk::CommandBuffer cmd;</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>// Start recording to the command buffer and render pass</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>cmd.begin(vk::CommandBufferBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Synch within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Synch between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A common use case for any software product is the ability to run a certain business logic whenever a particular event gets triggered. This event could occur in the form of a webhook fired by a 3rd party service to your server or it could be generated via your product itself. The point being this event triggers a transaction in your system and the loss of even a single transaction is not acceptable.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This seems straightforward enough when dealing with a low rate of such events, but if your server receives these events at the rate of 200 requests per second and each of these events require significant resources for processing them, it is no longer a trivial thing to do.</p><p>We had a similar requirement while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> which is a tool that helps e-commerce merchants notify their customers when orders are confirmed/shipped via WhatsApp. To implement this we register webhooks to receive order lifecycle events whenever a new e-commerce store signs up with our product.&nbsp;</p><p>This did not seem like a big deal at first until we released that if we acquire even a handful of stores that have a very high volume of orders, the number of webhooks we will receive is going to increase exponentially and if we need the product to scale, we would have to queue up the events and process them asynchronously instead of processing it the moment we receive a webhook.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Expectations from a message queue system</strong><br></p><p>There are 4 primary things that are needed if you want to queue up messages and process them asynchronously.</p><p>‍<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A dashboard where you can view all the current asynchronous jobs and make sure all of them are running smoothly and there is no clog anywhere.</li><li><strong>Error handling</strong>: The ability to retry failed transactions without having to receive the event again.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Zero loss</strong>: None of the events must be lost and must stay in the queue until they are picked up.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: If the volume of messages goes up, handling them should be as simple as adding another worker to the pool.</li></ol><p><strong>Available methods for doing this</strong><br></p><p>The above mentioned problem is not something new and has already been solved in many ways. Here are a few that I am aware of.</p><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">AWS SQS</a> as the queue and AWS Lambda as the handler for the jobs in the queue.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Celery</a> is a great framework that solves exactly this and it has compatibility with AWS SQS, Redis and Rabbit MQ.</li><li><a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">Python-rq</a> with Redis as the queue.</li></ol><p>I immediately ruled out the first method because it would involve too much vendor lock in with AWS and out of the remaining 2 methods, I personally got a little bit spooked by Celerys documentation as it seems a bit overwhelming for my simple use case of being able to deploy worker programs that pick up items from a queue and process them.</p><p>Therefore I decided to <a href="https://python-rq.org/" target="_blank">go with python-rq</a> as it was something I had previously tinkered with, so let's go through each of the expectations that I listed earlier and see if python-rq satisfied all of them.</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong><br></p><p>To quote one of the lines from the python-rq documentation, “Monitoring is where RQ shines”.&nbsp; You get access to a dashboard where you can view jobs that are currently being processed, pending jobs and failed jobs.</p><figure id="w-node-2f944d69418b-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765a977f73edea652de_BbkLnSZEcAQHbsz0e0tZvReFQzpRB1-tVoLDh3cKhIOpqKbD-h7ByCKokqzSMK-KwHnEYlkiQH56Yq4TKg9z5rtKDLO7e4DgCOWWHgn7foxSa_6Lk10DEhBBUsvyG8tnrmcJo8Vl.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ dashboard for viewing status of jobs</figcaption></figure><p>If you do not specify any queue while deploying the service, there is one queue created called “default” and all the jobs you enqueue will go into this queue.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively you can define as many queues as you want, and put jobs into the respective queues based on their priority. All of this is very well documented.</p><p>If you need to monitor some more things like how many jobs are queued at a given time in the form of a time series database or the maximum queued jobs within a given time range, you could export these metrics using <a href="https://github.com/mdawar/rq-exporter" target="_blank">rq_exporter</a> and display them on a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">grafana</a> dashboard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Error handling</strong><br></p><p>Python-RQ has several ways to retry failed jobs, you could specify a retry count while enqueuing the job itself as mentioned in their documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>You could also specify a time interval between each retry if you don’t want the job to be retried immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly you can also specify different time delays between each retry and achieve a system where if a job fails,&nbsp; you retry after 10 minutes and if it fails again, you could retry after 20 minutes, etc.</p><p>Even if you don’t specify any retry count, there is a default safety net built in where the failed jobs go into a “failed” queue and the same is displayed on the dashboard. You can retry them manually by clicking on “Requeue”.</p><p>You can even see the stack trace of the failed job so that you can make changes to the code if required before retrying the job.</p><figure id="w-node-6b3d732c052e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07659bfb9af7bf8dec02_F7KGjCLUhQ6nGEDjK-qpq4jooON2TyQkDBLzi1ova-tz3zSVAgimJ9mIycGnvHcxcCnAUr0Wl5pIHO7OzVEtJLR2D3go52skcan8DTAkYWA05o1AXUmH4ojKFfbT2qXSPBOUUG79.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Failed jobs displayed on RQ dashboard</figcaption></figure><div><p>Python-rq also allows you to define a custom exception handler at the time of starting your workers which you can use to do stuff like sending an alert to yourself over email/slack whenever there is an exception.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Zero loss</strong><br></p><p>When you restart python-rq it does a warm shutdown where new jobs from the queue are no longer accepted and existing jobs will finish running completely before shutting down the service. This ensures that there is no loss in data.</p><p>The producer program which is responsible for enqueuing the jobs must make sure that as soon as an event is received, it is immediately enqueued before running any other logic and this will ensure that there is no loss due to the producer failing to enqueue a job in time.&nbsp;</p><p>Since all the jobs will be saved in the Redis database and Redis has its own methods for prevention of data loss, this pretty much ensures that all your transactions will be executed.</p><p><strong>Scalability</strong><br></p><p>The Beauty of this setup is that if your application scales and you start receiving too many events, the server responsible for enqueuing the events will not face any lag and the only implication of this is that there might be a lag between the time a job is enqueued and the time it is executed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to reduce this lag, all you have to do is deploy another RQ worker that listens on the same Redis queue and the tasks will automatically get shared between all the existing workers that are subscribed to that queue. Based on how your traffic scales, you can keep deploying new workers on new instances without having to change anything else.</p><p><strong>Scheduling tasks with python-rq</strong><br></p><p>An added advantage of this infrastructure is that it also takes care of the case where one has to schedule a task to be executed at a later time. There are of course many ways of achieving this including cron jobs, but having this ability within your queuing infrastructure is very handy because all the other aspects like error handling and monitoring automatically get applied to this as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To add job scheduling abilities to python-rq, you would have to install <a href="https://github.com/rq/rq-scheduler" target="_blank">rq-scheduler</a> and run it as a separate service. This service will take care of picking up jobs that are to be executed at a given point in time and enqueue them into the queue that python-rq listens on.</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></p><p>For our particular use case, we receive close to 200 transactions per second and because they all go straight into a queue, 99% of these requests have a response time of 25 milliseconds or less.</p><figure id="w-node-2247ea7692bf-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d07651bda1c0398075cb6_oDk9wAzBCG3Dmao13tDK-uvkRTWHWk16MZrwMP7IjpnbbKTFElg35xOjtS6KtMfN6epWMPbyH25HySChqv-szF4bu5qGAMeOqxuQyD1Sx3sSwX92G3qdOsR2e09uGv1EnGxSWYW6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Server response time for enqueing jobs</figcaption></figure><p>As for the performance of the workers, we have currently deployed 5 workers and their capacity based on their free time vs busy time looks something like this.</p><figure id="w-node-bd68bbc03805-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f1d0765b5a619cd968b387a_zlVorXocx5iEHbrrk0QC_84rfs2IvRLyaKmaFUbMYyGXKw6NTApQfqaxkZPRMaMHX19BOo4510pTC4HuaWGpbzhHVnUFsMdV8jk33AQUU6fDdR42Lv-vaI8zHnJwsRWD5l3QiR89.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>RQ&nbsp;worker capacity</figcaption></figure><p>The blue shade represents workers being busy and the rest of the time workers are free.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install coremltools<span>==</span><span>4.0</span>b1
<span>import</span> coremltools <span>as</span> ct
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll fetch the <code>kinetics-i3d</code> repo and run the included sample evaluation script which loads the pre-rained RGB video classification model, performs an inference on a sample video (so we know that it’s working), and then exports the frozen TensorFlow model as <code>frozen_model.pb</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone https:<span>/</span><span>/</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>lukereichold<span>/</span>kinetics<span>-</span>i3d
<span>%</span>cd kinetics<span>-</span>i3d<span>/</span>

<span>!</span>python evaluate_sample<span>.</span>py <span>-</span><span>-</span>eval_type rgb
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll grab the class labels from the repo, where each of the 400 strings corresponds to a potential action in a video.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> open(<span></span><span>"</span><span>data/label_map.txt</span><span>"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
  class_labels <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>splitlines()

  <span>assert</span> len(class_labels) <span>==</span> <span>400</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-converting-the-frozen-model-to-core-ml">📲 Converting the frozen model to Core ML</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll use the <code>coremltools</code> package to convert our frozen TensorFlow model to an <code>mlmodel</code> that can be directly consumed by iOS and macOS applications.</p>
<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>
mlmodel <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>convert(<span></span><span>"</span><span>kinetics-i3d/frozen_model.pb</span><span>"</span>, source<span>=</span><span></span><span>'</span><span>tensorflow</span><span>'</span>, classifier_config<span>=</span>config, inputs<span>=</span>[range_input])
</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Optionally, add metadata to be visible in Xcode.</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>license <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Apache-2.0 License</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>author <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Google Inc.</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>version <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>1.0</span><span>"</span>
mlmodel<span>.</span>short_description <span>=</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>Convolutional neural network performing human action recognition on video data, trained on the Kinetics 400 dataset.</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>🎉 With the conversion successfully performed, we’ll save our new <code>mlmodel</code> to disk! It’s now ready to be imported into an Xcode project.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">mlmodel<span>.</span>save(<span></span><span>'</span><span>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><figure>

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<span>try</span> Classifier.shared.classify(asset) { predictions <span>in</span>
    print(predictions)
    <span>//</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>l</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>s</span><span>L</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>e</span><span>l</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>w</span><span>r</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>i</span><span>n</span><span>g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>o</span><span>b</span><span>a</span><span>b</span><span>i</span><span>l</span><span>i</span><span>t</span><span>y</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>9</span><span>9</span><span>7</span><span>8</span><span>8</span><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>3</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>1</span><span>6</span><span>9</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now. For more info, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10043/">2020 WWDC session covering Create ML</a>. Until next time!</p>

																				<p>HANOI: Vietnam has detected its first locally transmitted case of coronavirus in nearly 100 days, authorities said on Saturday, in a country whose swift and full lockdown won praise for controlling the spread of the disease.</p><p>“Patient 416” is a 57-year-old retired Vietnamese man in the southern city of Danang, and the first case of community transmission since April 16.</p>
<p>Local health officials have tested 105 people who had been in close contact with him, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
<p>The man had taken his mother to a hospital in the days before after showing symptoms of the sickness, authorities said, but gave no confirmation of how he was infected in a country where the virus appeared to have been stamped out for several months.</p>
<p>Vietnam has not recorded a single death from Covid-19.</p>
<p>“The patient is currently on ventilator support due to respiratory failure,” the ministry said, adding that his family believe his contacts with others were limited.</p>
<p>“He didn’t go out of the city and only stayed at home to look after his grandchild and interact with neighbours, he didn’t make contact with strangers,” it said.</p>
<p>Danang has been packed with local tourists returning to its beaches and restaurants since Vietnam lifted its lockdown.</p>
<p>Despite sharing a long, ungovernable border with China, Vietnam has recorded just 416 virus cases, including the latest from Danang.</p>
<p>Communist authorities were quick to lock down the country after the virus emerged in China, with a rigorous state quarantine and contact-tracing system put in place.</p>
<p>International flights remain strictly limited with a two-week mandatory quarantine laid out for visitors.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the tough response to the virus will help the economy as foreign investment and local consumer confidence bounces back.</p>									</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

<![CDATA[The Four Noble Truths in Buddhism]]>

July 25, 2020 | https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p>



<p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p>



<p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p>



<p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p>



<p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p>



<p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>



<p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p>




<h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2>



<p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p>



<p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p>



<ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul>



<p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p>



<p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p>



<p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p>



<p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p>



<p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality. </p>



<p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious. </p>



<p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p>



<p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p>



<p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p>



<p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p>



<ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol>



<p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p>



<p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p>



<p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p>



<p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p>



<h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2>



<p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p>



<h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3>



<p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p>



<p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p>



<p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p>



<p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p>



<p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it. A few minutes of compulsive behavior now and then, generally speaking, creates long term health consequences.</p>



<h3><span id="The_Bhava_Tanha_Sense_of_Wanting_To_Become_Something"></span>The Bhava Tanha: Sense of Wanting To Become Something<span></span></h3>



<p>Bhava Tanha is the desire to achieve permanence in some way. One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p>



<p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p>



<p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap. </p>



<p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p>



<p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest. </p>



<p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p>



<p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me. This desire for being recognized and praised is also Bhava Tanha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-2"></span></p>



<h3><span id="The_Vibhava_Tanha_Desire_To_Get_Rid_of_Things"></span>The Vibhava Tanha: Desire To Get Rid of Things<span></span></h3>



<p>There is another type of Tanha that is the exact opposite of Bhava Tanha. It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p>



<p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p>



<p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

* Font detection - Getting the width/height of the browser "fallback" (default) serif, sans-serif, and monospaces fonts, then measuring the width of a bunch of fonts (Augur's list has over 800) and seeing if there is any differences between the tested font and the defaults

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

		<p>Do you want to learn how to utterly destroy SJWs in an argument? How about those fascist, right-wing Nazis?</p>
<p>Well, you’ll have to figure out how to do that on your own.</p>
<p>But if you’re one of those buzzkills who wants to give your argumentative opponent a fair shake, the philosopher Daniel Dennett has some advice. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393348784/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><i>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</i></a>, he provides four simple rules (adopted from those crafted by the game theorist Anatol Rapoport) for criticizing the views of those with whom you disagree:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, ‘Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.’</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An immediate effect of taking such an approach, Dennett says, is that your opponents “will be a receptive audience for your criticism: you have already shown that you understand their positions as well as they do (you agree with them on some important matters and have even been persuaded by something they said).”</p>
<p>Dennett admits that not all opponents are worthy of such respectful treatment, but when they are it pays off to be as charitable as possible. “It is worth reminding yourself,” he says, “that a heroic attempt to find a defensible interpretation of an author, if it comes up empty, can be even more devastating than an angry hatchet job. I recommend it.”</p>
<p>And so do I.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome has been something I've dealt with my whole life. And it seems to follow me, no matter what position I'm in or where I go.</p><p>In middle school, I was in awe of high schoolers and how much they seemed to know. When I became a high school student, I was intimidated by college students who had started to creep their way into the working world. Now, as a college student in that position, I feel like an imposter around students with impressive resumes, including those who interviewed me to join different student organizations.</p><p>It was after joining one of those organizations that I started to see how wrong my perceptions were. These students weren't superhuman figures, they were just kids with hobbies, interests, and really cool personalities.</p><p>At that point, I'd realized the fact that's helped me get through future instances of imposter syndrome: <em>everyone's a human being, just like you and I.</em></p><p>That includes Jeff Bezos, your job interviewer, your high school teacher, your mentor. They're all humans, who've probably gone through the same experiences you have. At some point, your job interviewer was the interviewee. They know your heart's racing, that there are thick beads of sweat building up around your temple, that your brain is just 70% in the game —&nbsp;because they've been there.</p><p>This lesson has helped me in so many places. At work, I'm constantly confused with our massive codebase. Asking questions was a pretty scary thing, especially at the beginning. I didn't want to seem like I didn't know what I was doing, or that I wasn't capable. Plowing through the unknown headfirst didn't work so well for me —&nbsp;I later found out that those confusing things I'd spent 3 hours on could be answered in a minute from someone who knew better. And there was never any judgement, because they'd been there themselves.</p><p>So don't sweat things too much. There's no need to put others on a pedestal. Just see them as another person, not too different from yourself, in a position you want to get to. Reach and ask for help; chances are, they'd be happy to.</p></div><div><div><p><a href="https://roland.imprint.to/">Roland's Blog</a></p><p>My thoughts, stories, and ideas</p></div></div></div>]]>

What is Nintendo playing at?
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8506159587861018996">
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article">
           <div itemprop="articleBody">
            
  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

            <p>Variables are one of the fundamental blocks of any programming language, the way each language defines how we declare and interact with variables can make or break a programming language. Thus any developer needs to understand how to effectively work with variables, their rules, and particularities. In today’s tutorial, we are going to learn how to declare, interact, and scope variables in JavaScript. We will introduce new concepts and important JavaScript keywords like <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="declaring-variables">Declaring variables</h2>
<p>Nowadays JavaScript has three different keywords to declare a variable, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and, <code>const</code>. Each with its own properties and particularities. Let’s start by making a simple comparison table of the 3 and then getting into the details.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Scope</th>
<th>Hoisting</th>
<th>Can be reassign</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></td>
<td>Function</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let</a></td>
<td>Block</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">const</a></td>
<td>Block</td>
<td>No</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Don’t worry if for now, you are not sure what we mean by scope, hoisting, or any of the other attributes. We are going to cover them in detail next.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-scope">Variable Scope</h2>
<p>Scope in JavaScript refers to context (or portion) of the code which determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In JavaScript, we have 2 types of scope, <strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong>. Though local scope can have different meanings.</p>
<p>Let’s work out through the definitions by giving some examples of how scoping works. Let’s say you define a variable <code>message</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// 'Hello World'
</span></code></pre></div><p>As you may expect the variable <code>message</code> used in the <code>console.log</code> would exist and have the value <code>Hello World</code>.  No Doubts there, but what happens if I change a bit where I declare the variable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: message is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>Ups… Looks like we broke it, but why? The thing is that the <code>if</code> statement creates a local <strong>block scope</strong>, and since we used const the variable is only declared for that <strong>block scope</strong>, and cannot be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit more about block and function scopes.</p>
<h3 id="block-scope">Block Scope</h3>
<p>A block is basically a section of code (zero or more statements) which is delimited by a pair of curly braces and may optionally be labeled.</p>
<p>As we already discussed the use of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> allows us to define variables that live within the block scope. Next, we’ll build very similar examples by using different keywords to generate new scopes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>const</span> <span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x1</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s explain this one as it may look a bit strange at first. In our outer scope, we are defining the variable <code>x1</code> with a value of <code>1</code>. Then we create a new block scope by simply using curly braces, this is strange, but totally legal within JavaScript, and in this new scope, we create a new variable (separate from the one in the outer scope) also named <code>x1</code>. But don’t get confused, this is a brand new variable, which will only be available within that scope.</p>
<p>Same example now with a named scope:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>myNewScope</span><span>:</span> { <span>// Named scope
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x2</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>While example (<strong>DO NOT RUN THE CODE BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>while</span>(<span>x3</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span>) {
    <span>const</span> <span>x3</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x3</span>) <span>// Never executed
</span></code></pre></div><p>Can you guess what’s wrong with that code? And what would happen if you run it?… Let me explain, <code>x3</code> as declared in the outer scope is used for the while comparison <code>x3 === 1</code>, normally inside the while statement, I’d be able to reassign <code>x3</code> a new value and exit the loop, however as we are declaring a new <code>x3</code> withing the block scope, we cannot change <code>x3</code> from the outer scope anymore, and thus the while condition will always evaluate to <code>true</code> producing an infinite loop that will hang your browser, or if you are using a terminal to run it on NodeJS will print a lot of <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Fixing this particular code could be tricky unless you actually rename either variables.</p>
<p>So far in our example, we used <code>const</code>, but exactly the same behavior would happen with <code>let</code>. However, we saw in our comparison table that the keyword <code>var</code> is actually function scope, so what does it mean for our examples? Well… let’s take a look:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
{
    <span>var</span> <span>x4</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x4</span>) <span>// 2
</span></code></pre></div><p>Amazing! even though we re-declared <code>x4</code> inside the scope it changed the value to <code>2</code> on the inner scope as well as the outer scope. An this is one of the <strong>most important</strong> differences between <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code>  and is usually subject (in one way or another) for interview questions.</p>
<h3 id="function-scope">Function Scope</h3>
<p>A function scope is in a way also a block scope, so <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> would behave the same way they did in our previous examples. However, function scopes also encapsulate variables declared with <code>var</code>. but let’s see that continuing with our <code>xn</code> examples:</p>
<p><code>const</code> or <code>let</code> example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>x5</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x5</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>Exactly as we expected it, and now with <code>var</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x6</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 2
</span><span></span>}
<span>myFunction</span>()
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x6</span>) <span>// 1
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this scenario, var worked the same way as <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.  Moreover:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>x7</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
}
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x7</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: x7 is not defined
</span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, <code>var</code> declarations only exist within the function they were created in and can’t be accessed from the outside.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it, as always JS has been evolving, and newer type of scopes has been created.</p>
<h3 id="module-scope">Module Scope</h3>
<p>With the introduction of modules in ES6, it was important for variables in a module not to directly affect variables in other modules. Can you imagine a world where importing modules from a library would conflict with your variables? Not even JS is that messy!
So by definition modules create their own scope which encapsulates all variables created with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>, similar to the function scope.</p>
<p>There are ways though that modules provide to export variables so they can be accessed from outside the module, and that I covered already in the article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-08-an-intro-to-javascript-modules/">An Intro To JavaScript Modules</a>.</p>
<p>So far we talked about different types of <strong>local</strong> scopes, let’s now dive into <strong>global</strong> scopes.</p>
<h3 id="global-scope">Global Scope</h3>
<p>A variable defined outside any function, block, or module scope has global scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.</p>
<p>The global scope can sometimes be confused with module scope, but this is not the case, a global scope variable can be used across modules, though this is considered a bad practice, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>How would you go about declaring a global variable? It depends on the context, it is different on a browser than a NodeJS application. In the context of the browser, you can do something as simply as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    <span>let</span> <span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Or by using the window object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
    window.<span>MESSAGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World'</span>
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>MESSAGE</span>)
&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>There are some reasons you wanna do something like this, however, always be careful when you do it.</p>
<h3 id="nesting-scopes">Nesting scopes</h3>
<p>As you probably guessed by now, it is possible to nest scopes, meaning to create a scope within another scope, and its a very common practice. Simply by adding an <code>if</code> statement inside a function we are doing this. So let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>nextedScopes</span>() {
    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>

    <span>if</span> (<span>true</span>) {
        <span>const</span> <span>fromIf</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello If Block!'</span>
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>message</span>) <span>// Hello World!
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>fromIf</span>) <span>// ReferenceError: fromIf is not defined
</span><span></span>}

<span>nextedScopes</span>()
</code></pre></div><h3 id="lexical-scope">Lexical Scope</h3>
<p>In a way, we already made use of lexical scope, though we didn’t know about it. Lexical scope simply means that the children scopes have access to the variables defined in outer scopes.</p>
<p>Let’s see it with an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>outerScope</span>() {
    <span>var</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Juan'</span>
    <span>function</span> <span>innerScope</span>() {
        <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>) <span>// 'Juan'
</span><span></span>    }

    <span>return</span> <span>innerScope</span>
}

<span>const</span> <span>inner</span> <span>=</span> <span>outerScope</span>()
<span>inner</span>()
</code></pre></div><p>That looks stranger than what it is, so let’s explain it. The function <code>outerScope</code> declares a variable <code>name</code> with value <code>Juan</code> and a function named <code>innerScope</code>. The later does not declare any variables for its own scope but makes use of the variable <code>name</code> declared in the outer function scope.</p>
<p>When <code>outerScope()</code> gets called it returns a reference to the <code>innerScope</code> function, which is later called from the outermost scope. When reading this code for the first time you may be confused as to why <code>innerScope</code> would <code>console.log</code> the value <code>Juan</code> as we are calling it from the global scope, or module scope, where <code>name</code> is not declared.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is thanks to JavaScript closures. Closures is a topic of its own and you can read more about it on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">MDN docs</a>. I’m planning an article to explain closures on simple terms but is not ready at the time of this writing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hoisting">Hoisting</h2>
<p>Hoisting in terms of JavaScript means that a variable is created in memory during the compile phase, and thus they can actually be used before they are actually declared. Sounds super confusing, let’s better see it in code.</p>
<p>This is what a normal flow would look like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>displayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>displayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Awesome! as expected that works, but what would you think of the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

<span>function</span> <span>hoistedDisplayName</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>name</span>)
}

<span>//***********************
</span><span>// Outputs
</span><span>//***********************
</span><span>// 'Juan'
</span></code></pre></div><p>Wait wait wait…. what? As crazy as it sounds, since the function is assigned to memory before the code actually runs, the function <code>hoistedDisplayName</code> is available before its actual definition, at least in terms of code lines.</p>
<p>Functions have this particular property, but also do variables declared with <code>var</code>. Let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>x8</span>) <span>// undefined
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>x8</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Not what you guessed? The fact that the variable is “created” before its actual definition in the code doesn’t mean that its value …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>This post is a recipe for setting up a minimal Kubernetes cluster on
Fedora without requiring virtualization or a container registry. These
two features make the system cloud-agnostic and the cluster entirely
self-contained. The post will end with us running a simple Flask app
from a local container.</p>
<p>This setup is primarily useful for simple CI environments or
application development on Linux. (Docker Desktop has better tooling
for development on Mac or Windows.)</p>
<h3 id="getting-kubernetes">Getting Kubernetes</h3><p>The core of this effort is <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a>, a Kubernetes
distribution that allows us to run on a single node without
virtualization.</p>
<p>But first off, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/">install Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Then install K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
</code></pre>
<p>It may prompt you to adjust some SELinux policies like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install -y container-selinux selinux-policy-base
$ sudo rpm -i https://rpm.rancher.io/k3s-selinux-0.1.1-rc1.el7.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>
<p>Swap these out with whatever it prompts and retry the K3s install.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">install
kubectl</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
</code></pre>
<p>Now copy the global K3s kubeconfig into <code>~/.kube/config</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $USER:$GROUP ~/.kube/config
</code></pre>
<p>And enable K3s:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable k3s
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on Fedora 31+ you'll need to disable cgroups v2 and reboot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo grubby --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0" --update-kernel=ALL
$ sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can run <code>kubectl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-simple-application">A simple application</h3><p>We'll create a small Flask app, containerize it, and write a
Kubernetes deployment and service config for it.</p>
<p>We begin with <code>app.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World, Flask!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Then a <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:3-slim

RUN pip install flask
COPY . /app

CMD python3 /app/app.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then the deployment in <code>manifest.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: helloworld
          name: helloworld
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-in-kubernetes">Running in Kubernetes</h3><p>First we build, save, and import the image into <code>k3s</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build . -t helloworld
$ docker save helloworld &gt; helloworld.tar
$ sudo k3s ctr image import helloworld.tar
$ kubectl apply -f ./manifest.yaml
$ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods | grep helloworld | cut -d ' ' -f 1) 5000 &gt; log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
$ curl localhost:5000
Hello World, Flask
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Let’s take the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int * f()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}

int g( int * p  )
{
    return 3 + *( p? f(): p );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has two errors in it. First, <code>f</code> returns a pointer to a local variable,
which goes out of scope. Second, the check in <code>g</code> is reversed; in the case
<code>p</code> is a null pointer, it dereferences it, instead of doing the opposite –
dereference <code>p</code> only when it’s not null.</p>

<p>This is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rbn9KP">GCC emits</a> for <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g(int*):
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR ds:0
        ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, it can obviously see that <code>g</code> will either dereference a null pointer
(undefined behavior), or an invalid pointer (undefined behavior), so it generates
code that dereferences a null pointer (<code>mov eax, [0]</code>), which crashes, and then
emits the guaranteed-invalid instruction <code>ud2</code>, which crashes.</p>

<p>(You can’t be too sure, is GCC’s motto.)</p>

<p>And this is what <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/zW5dzY">Clang emits</a> for the same function:</p>



<p>Presumably, the logic here is that one of the branches leads to undefined behavior,
and the other also leads to undefined behavior, so we might as well remove the whole
thing, it’s not going to get called anyway in a correct program. (But if it does, let’s
just return, as crashing would be gauche.)</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I’m left wondering here; if the compilers can clearly
see that all possible code paths through this function lead to undefined behavior,
why don’t they <em>tell us that</em>? Something like “Warning: function invokes undefined behaviour
on all control paths, you might want to check your code, mate”, except less formal.</p>

<p>Who cares about that, some might say, nobody writes such code anyway, this will catch
no bugs. Well, I have obviously oversimplified a bit. Let’s take a slightly more
realistic example, such as this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int slice_sum( std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp; v, int i, int n )
{
    int s = 0;

    for( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
    {
        assert( i+j &gt;= 0 );
        assert( i+j &lt; v.size() );
        
        s += v[ i+j ];
    }

    return s;
}

int f()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    return slice_sum( v, 3, 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YGYYd">GCC do</a>?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LC0:
        .string "int slice_sum(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int, int)"
.LC1:
        .string "./example.cpp"
.LC3:
        .string "i+j &lt; v.size()"

f():
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     ecx, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     edx, 11
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC1
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC3
        call    __assert_fail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Goes straight to <code>__assert_fail</code>, without passing Go and collecting $200.</p>

<p>What does <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aP5qEW">Clang do</a>? Same thing.</p>

<p>Again, if the compilers can clearly see that calling <code>f</code> produces a guaranteed
assertion failure, why don’t they tell us?</p>

<p>Because we are put here on this planet to suffer, that is why.</p>

<p>(Also because <code>assert</code> is a macro that the compilers do not even see, and they
don’t know that <code>__assert_fail</code> is the assertion failure handler, and contracts,
which would have allowed us to write <code>[[assert: i+j &lt; v.size()]]</code> , were removed
from C++20 as being too useful, but those are just random second-order
manifestations of the cosmic need for suffering.)</p>

</p><p>
According to a report in The Information, an internal programme at Google known as "Android Lockbox" gives employees access to data on how Android users interact with popular, non-Google apps like </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="TikTok" actualkeyword="TikTok">TikTok</keyword><p>, </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Facebook" keynameseo="facebook" actualkeyword="facebook">Facebook</keyword><p> and </p><keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Instagram" actualkeyword="Instagram">Instagram</keyword><p>.
</p><p>
    "When YouTube was planning the rollout of its rival to TikTok in India earlier this month, employees turned to a valuable source of market research: how people in the country were using TikTok and its competitors on Android", the report claimed.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>The programme works via Google Mobile Services (GMS).
</p><p>
    "In some cases, such as YouTube in India, this data helps Google advance its own competing apps, say the people, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely," the report added.
</p><p>
The Google employees can reportedly see "sensitive" data about other apps, including how often they're opened and for how long they're used.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Google-owned YouTube is working on a TikTok rival called Shorts, to be introduced by the end of this year.
</p><p>
"Google is also thought to have used the internal programme to plan the launch of its TikTok competitor called Shorts", according to the report.
</p><p>
    "Android Lockbox" works after Google users agree to share information as part of the Android setup process.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>Users are told that this data allows Google to offer a more personalised experience. According to the report, it also provides data for competitive research.
</p><p>
    Google admitted that it has access to usage data from rival apps.
</p><p>
A Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement: "Since 2014, the Android App Usage Data API has been used by Google and Android developers who have been authorized by Android OEMs or users to access basic data about app usage -- such as how often apps are opened -- to analyze and improve services".
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>"The API doesn't obtain any information about in-app activity and our collection of this data is disclosed to and controllable by users," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
The US government is set to grill Google along with other tech giants over its dominance in their fields of Search and anti-market practices. The panel announced its antitrust probe into the tech giants in June last year.
</p><p>
    Google isn't the only company that's been accused of such data gathering practices.
</p><p>
<span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>In 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook used a VPN service called Onavo to monitor rival services.
</p><p>
    Onavo Protect -- a Facebook's software that was going to get the functionality -- was billed as a piece of VPN software. Onavo was used primarily to gather information about what other apps Facebook users were using on their mobile devices.
</p><p>
The app was shut down in 2019.

				<p>

<span><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer.png" alt="Technical drawing of keyboard keys" title="Typometer"></span>Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text / code editors.</p>
<p>Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen update, in particular case – delay between keystroke and character appearance. While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.), typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.</p>
<p>Check my article <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure">Typing with pleasure</a> to learn more about editor latency and its effects on typing performance.</p>
<p>Project source code is available as a <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer/releases/download/v1.0.1/typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip">typometer-1.0.1-bin.zip</a> (0.5 MB)</p>
<p>Java 8 or latter is required to run the program. You can <a href="https://java.com/download">download Java</a> from the official site.<br>
<span id="more-1135"></span></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).</li>
<li>Native API calls for faster screen access.</li>
<li>Synchronous / asynchronous modes.</li>
<li>Import / export of CSV data.</li>
<li>Summary statistics, frequency distribution.</li>
<li>Line / bar charts (including comparative ones).</li>
<li>Chart image export (with legend).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Screenshots</h3>
<p>Main window:</p>
<p><img alt="Typometer, main window" title="Typometer, main window" src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-window.png"></p>
<p>Frequency distribution chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://pavelfatin.com/images/typometer/typometer-distribution.png" alt="Typometer, frequency distribution chart" title="Typometer, frequency distribution chart"></p>
<h3>Principle</h3>
<p>The program generates OS input events (key presses) and uses screen capture to fully automate the test process.</p>
<p>At first, a predefined pattern (“<code>.....</code>“) is inserted in editor window in order to detect screen metrics (start position, step, background, etc.).</p>
<p>After that, the program types a predefined number of “<code>.</code>” characters into the editor (with given periodicity), measuring delays between key presses and corresponding character drawings.</p>
<p>To achieve high accuracy of measurement, only a single pixel is queried for each symbol. Moreover, the program can use fast native API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">WinAPI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">XLib</a>) calls on supported platforms, offering <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">AWT robot</a> as a fallback option.</p>
<p>There are two modes of testing available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> – the program always waits for typed character to appear before making a pause and typing the next character. It’s the most accurate method (because there’s no threading overhead).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> – the program types and recognizes characters independently. This method is slightly less accurate, but it’s useful for testing rapid typing, when editor drawing might easily lag by multiple characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>To register only essential editor latency, text must be rendered directly to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer">framebuffer</a>, without intermediate image processing that might introduce additional delay. Prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager">stacking window managers</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositing window managers</a> for the testing purposes, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Classic theme in Windows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero">Windows Aero</a> enforces internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_television#Vertical_synchronization">vertical synchronization</a>, which leads to minimum 1 frame lag (about 17 ms for 60 Hz monitor refresh rate) and delay discretization. It’s also possible to disable the compositing directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021060058/http://www.softwareaudioconsole.com/Tweaking_Windows_7.htm">in Windows 7</a> and <a href="http://www.rlauncher.com/wiki/index.php?title=Input_Lag_Checklist#Disable_Desktop_Composition_in_Windows_8_and_8.1">in Windows 8</a>.</li>
<li>Use Linux distributive with lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, like <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbox">Openbox</a>). Complex, 3D-based windows managers might substantially increase system rendering latency, for example, on my hardware, Ubuntu’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a>, adds ~10 ms unavoidable lag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Close all programs that add system-wide keyboard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking">hooks</a>, as they might process the keyboard events synchronously and affect the results (for example, <a href="http://www.workrave.org/">Workrave</a> is known to noticeable increase the typing latency).</p>
<p>You may consider switching your machine in a particular hardware mode (power scheme, integrated / discrete graphics, etc.). In power save mode (and on battery), for example, editor responsiveness is usually much lower, so it’s possible to detect significant performance glitches which are less frequently observable otherwise.</p>
<p>Before you start benchmarking, make sure that other applications are not placing noticeable load on your system. It’s up to you whether to “warm up” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">VM</a>-based editors, so they can pre-compile performance-critical parts of their code before proceeding.</p>
<p>If possible, enable non-block caret (i. e. underline / vertical bar instead of rectangle) in editor. This might increase measurement accuracy.</p>
<p>Typical action sequence is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a measurement title, like “HTML in Vim” <em>(optional, can be set later)</em>.</li>
<li>Configure test parameters <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Launch an editor, maximize its window.</li>
<li>Open some data in the editor, for instance, a large HTML file <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
<li>Place editor caret in desired context (like comment, etc.), at the end of short / empty line.</li>
<li>Start benchmarking process in the program.</li>
<li>After a corresponding prompt, transfer focus to the editor window.</li>
<li>Wait for test completion, don’t interfere with the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always interrupt the testing process simply by transferring focus back to the program window.</p>
<p>After test result is acquired, you may either analyze the singular data by itself or perform additional tests (different editors / conditions) to do comparative analysis.</p>
<p>Both source- and aggregate data is easily accessible, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy table content  as text,</li>
<li>save chart to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> file (with legend and summary stats),</li>
<li>export raw data in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, if you fancy).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to merge results either by inserting data from an existing CSV file, or by appending data to a CSV file on saving.</p>
<h3>Recipes</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips on how you can use the tool to detect performance bottlenecks in text / code editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether number of lines influences the latency. If so, typing might “lag” inside a large file.</li>
<li>Check whether editor window size influences the latency. If so, the editor probably does excessive repainting instead of drawing only a newly inserted symbol.</li>
<li>Check whether latency depends on horizontal symbol position. Ideally, that correlation should be undetectable.</li>
<li>Try to enable highlighting / autocomplete / folding / spellchecker / etc. Those features should be processed asynchronously, without affecting the typing as such.</li>
<li>Try to run the test in power-saving mode. Ideally, typing should be handled decently even on less powerful hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re implementing a text / code editor, take a look at the <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/low-latency-painting-in-awt-and-swing/">programming techniques</a> to significantly reduce the drawing latency.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>To make benchmarking possible, correct screen metrics must be detected at the initial step. The program attempts to recognize a custom pattern (5 new dots) in order to determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting position,</li>
<li>horizontal step,</li>
<li>background color,</li>
<li>line length,</li>
<li>caret type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are many editors (and multiple versions of each editor), which looks different on different platforms, and there are many possible color schemes and fonts, the metrics recognition algorithm has to be very flexible. While the program sources contain a great deal of test cases, some glitches are still probable.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of typical problems and corresponding solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor background is non-uniform (gradient, picture) – set solid color background.</li>
<li>Characters are too low-contrast and obscure – use a crisp color scheme.</li>
<li>Dot characters merge with the caret – increase font size.</li>
<li>Editor replaces multiple dots with ellipsis – disable that auto-correction.</li>
<li>Spaces between dots are uneven – use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a> in the editor.</li>
<li>Editor has a left panel that melds with the text area – hide the panel.</li>
</ul>

Today we will go through the process of setting up an entire internal PKI backed by the security guarantee the HSM provides. First, we will generate a root CA with a private key living on the HSM’s hardware. Then, we will generate an Intermediate CA, whose private key will live secured by file system permissions in Linux. Then, we will walk through an example of generating a client certificate for use on internal endpoints. The root certificate can be distributed to the root certificate store of managed endpoints, and the machine used to generate the root CA’s private key can subsequently be kept offline.</p><p><img itemprop="url" src="https://cdn.ssltrust.com.au/assets/images/help/internal-pki-openssl-nitrokey-hsm/nitrokey-hsm.jpg" alt="Create an Internal PKI using OpenSSL and NitroKey HSM"></p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Before getting started, make sure to have setup a machine running Ubuntu Linux capable of talking to the NitroKey.

    <main>
      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is a short post reflecting on some pretty basic C++ that bothered me
because I felt like I didn't fully understand it. I felt that the language
should be able to do more, and wanted to understand why it could not.</p>

<p>In C++, subtype polymorphism allows pointers and references of child classes to
be treated as their parents<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    Child<span>*</span> child <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>foo</span><span>(</span>child<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is at the core of Object Oriented style programming in C++, and, like all
forms of polymorphism, allows us to write code that is only tied to an
interface, not its implementations. We can swap out implementations easily,
making the code more flexible, as well as more testable: test doubles that
implement the interface can be injected during tests.</p>
<p>C++ also provides another mechanism for polymorphism: templates. Templates
allow us to parameterise interfaces by type. The template <code>std::vector</code>
describes a growable list and is parametrised by the type the list contains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in C++, you cannot combine these two forms of polymorphism in a
way that you might like to.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1">1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2">2 </span>
<span id="L3">3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4">4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5">5 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L6">6 </span>    
<span id="L7">7 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>It's easy to explain this by pointing out that <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> does not
inherit from <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code>, and so why would you expect to be able to
use them interchangeably?</p>
<p>This explanation makes sense intuitively, but I found it to be lacking. I
thought about this:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>new</span> <span>Child</span><span>()</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span> children_as_parents <span>=</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span>        <span>*</span><span>reinterpret_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>*</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span>children<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>bar</span><span>(</span>children_as_parents<span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>I thought this would be "safe" (we'll see why not below): the memory layout
will still be valid, as the
vector contains pointers, so accessing elements of the vector would work as
expected; and of course, because <code>Child</code> inherits from <code>Parent</code>, accessing the
<code>Parent</code> members after the cast would also work as expected.</p>
<p>I thought: if I know that this is safe, why can't the compiler? If the compiler
can know that it's safe, why doesn't the language allow it without circumventing
the type system with <code>reinterpret_cast</code>?</p>

<p>The example above is not actually safe because the vector is mutable. We could
add pointers to other subtypes of <code>Parent</code> to <code>children_as_parents</code> while still
being able to access <code>children</code>, which would now be undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>This suggests we could never have <code>std::vector</code> behave the way I've described
with subtypes, and immutable containers would be needed instead.</p>

<p>The <code>reinterpret_cast</code> done above would only work because I know that the
implementation of <code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> and <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> is
identical.</p>
<p>However, that of course isn't the case in general for templates: part of their
function is that you can specialise them for different type arguments.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span><span>class</span><span> A</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>...</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Parent<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>    <span>double</span> m_<span>;</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>
<span id="L10">10 </span><span>template</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>class</span><span> A</span><span>&lt;</span>Child<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>    <span>int</span> bar_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you were able to pass <code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> as if it were <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, what could that
look like?</p>
<p>When a <code>Child</code> object is copied to a <code>Parent</code> object, it is <em>sliced</em>. This just
means that any data in the child object that isn't part of <code>Parent</code> is not
copied.</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span>        <span>return</span> foo_<span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L13">13 </span>
<span id="L14">14 </span> <span>private</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>const</span> <span>int</span> foo_ <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L17">17 </span>
<span id="L18">18 </span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L19">19 </span>    Child child<span>;</span>
<span id="L20">20 </span>    Parent parent <span>=</span> child<span>;</span>  
<span id="L21">21 </span>    <span>return</span> parent<span>.</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>  
<span id="L22">22 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>There's no obvious way for this to work for our template example above:
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not share the members of <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, how could it be sliced
down?</p>
<p>Even if we were to take a reference (which means no slicing would occur), the
problem is essentially the same: <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> could have a method that
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code> does not have.</p>

<p>Of course, we can still write a function that could take a <code>A&lt;Parent&gt;</code> or
<code>A&lt;Child&gt;</code>: with templating:</p>
<div>
<pre id="vimCodeElement"><span id="L1"> 1 </span><span>class</span><span> Parent</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L2"> 2 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L3"> 3 </span>    <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L4"> 4 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L5"> 5 </span>
<span id="L6"> 6 </span><span>class</span><span> Child</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L7"> 7 </span> <span>public</span><span>:</span>
<span id="L8"> 8 </span>    <span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L9"> 9 </span>        <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L10">10 </span>    <span>}</span>
<span id="L11">11 </span><span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L12">12 </span>
<span id="L13">13 </span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span id="L14">14 </span><span>int</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span>T<span>*</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;</span> vec<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span id="L15">15 </span>    <span>return</span> vec<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>;</span>
<span id="L16">16 </span><span>}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>But what I wanted was to be able to express that my function can take a vector
of any type that implements <code>Parent</code>. This doesn't express that. There's no way
in C++ to explicitly constrain the types on templates. In C++20, concepts
provide a minimal way to do this<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concept constraints are implicitly met, not explicitly implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concepts are orthogonal to the subtype polymorphism I want to ergonomically take advantage of.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, the explanation of why you can't pass <code>std::vector&lt;Child*&gt;</code> as
<code>std::vector&lt;Parent*&gt;</code> is really the same explanation we had at the start: you
can't pass templates of subtypes as templates of parents because the template
itself is not a subtype.</p>
<p>But really, a more meta-explanation is that C++ lacks the ability to constrain
template type arguments. This makes templates inherently inexpressive, and
makes it difficult to harmoniously use templates with inherited types.</p>
<p>This is one place where Rust shines in comparison to C++.</p>

<p>I really like the way Rust approaches polymorphism. Traits are Rust's only
mechanism for polymorphism. They provide a unified way for specifying both
static and dynamic interfaces. They facilitate designs based on composition,
reducing coupling. They allow for explicit constraint of type arguments in
generics.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In Rust, we can express the equivalent of what we wanted above easily:<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>This is the power of a more expressive type system, which to me is such a
crucial part of a programming language. C++'s type system always falls flat for
me, for many reasons: the limited expressiveness shown above; the lack of a way
for the type system to to track object lifetime, so we have a library of smart
pointers instead which can easily be abused; implicit type conversion that can
make code less clear and cause bugs; references that are taken implicitly; a
confusing value taxonomy.</p>
<p>I am definitely complaining here; but I also think part of developing a good
understanding of a system is understanding its limitations, being able to
understand why some things aren't possible, and knowing what a different system
would (or does!) look like. I hope this Rust example has helped with that.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any C++ insight to share I'd appreciate it: it's a
complex topic and I always have more to learn :)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/smattrr">Matthew Fernandez</a> kindly sent me <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/covariance-and-contravariance-in-subtyping/">this blog
post</a>
about the concept of type variance, which gives us a more formal language to
talk about some of the ideas discussed in this blog post, namely that C++
templates are <em>invariant</em>. I desired for them to be <em>covariant</em>.</p>
<p>From the linked blog post, "variance refers to how subtyping between more
complex types relates to subtyping between their components". In Rust,
implementing a trait does not create a subtype of that trait, so there's no
concept of variance to apply to our example above.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The issue of variance in C++ is relevant due to the use of both templates and
subtyping; Rust's unified mechanism for polymorphism, with explicitly met
constraints on type arguments, avoids this issue.</p>

Naively, it means that you have the right to express ideas without fear of governmental retaliation or censorship. But that’s not worth much in a vacuum. Free speech is valuable when you are communicating with others: abstractly, freedom of speech means the right to distribute information to an audience.</p> <p>If you frame freedom of speech not in terms of what comes out of your mouth, but in terms of the interaction between yourself and another party,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> then edge cases rapidly emerge. For example, suppose that you are on the street, lawfully raising a protest sign supporting X. You are hoping to persuade passers-by. The government sends in <em>five hundred</em> counter-protestors, peacefully raising <em>not X</em> signs. Your voice is drowned out in the crowd. You are unable to reach the passers-by; it’s as if you were not there. Is this censorship? I am no constitutional lawyer, but the effect is undeniably censorious – it is practically as if you had been sent home by the police.</p> <p>Historically, I haven’t seen this type of scenario give rise to much concern among constitutional scholars – perhaps for reasons of practicality. Perpetually mobilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturf</a> brigades to drown out individual voices is hardly practically feasible.</p> <p>However, this has dangerously changed as discourse has moved online. The real-world constraints to astroturfing do not exist online. With <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-gpt-3-learning-language-fitfully/">GPT-3</a>, the marginal cost of distributing astroturfed propaganda online has firmly hit zero. GPT-3 represents the newest generation of text-generating AI, and it is extremely good – perfectly indistinguishable from a human in short form, articulate, detailed, and capable of infinite variety in style and tone. Now it is actually possible for any online group discussion to be brigaded by thousands of automated users – indistinguishable from real humans – twisting the conversation, while drowning out the voices of real humans.</p> <p>This will become common in no time. It’s too effective a weapon for malicious states to pass it up. Manual online astroturfing is already widespread. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Water_Army">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">Russia</a> pay thousands of state employees to spread propaganda online. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections">Russiagate</a> and the now widespread conspiracy theories on Antivax, 5G, COVID-19, etc. show, it’s very effective: social media platforms have enabled divide-and-conquer strategies at unprecedented scale and granularity. They have become a battleground for the opinions of people in the West, and these people haven’t realized it yet. Using fully automated, infinitely scalable tools to infect the minds of your opponents with malicious ideas and sow discord offers an unprecedentedly high ROI to the villains of the world.</p> <p>Thus, we are moving into a world where bad actors can interfere with free speech with a new form of censorship: the use of automated voices, indistinguishable from real ones, to overpower genuine voices online, and to shape the appearance of public discourse according to their goals. If you believe, as many scholars do, that democratic societies are critically reliant on your freedom to distribute information, then this poses a severe threat.</p> <p>The abstract problem is that on the internet, we don’t have a good way to tell real humans from fake ones. The current state-of-the-art tests are CAPTCHAs with challenges that “only humans could pass”: read the word, click all the squares with traffic lights, and so forth. Obviously these aren’t going to resist automation for long. They will be useless across the board in a few years, once general image recognition tools are as good as some substantial minority of humans.</p> <p>In the long term, AI will be effectively impossible to distinguish from humans online. The only solution is to use what we have and they don’t – real-world identification. A real-world ID could correspond to some set of private keys, so you could sign your online actions to prove their human authenticity. You could have a large number of private keys, so as to enable ample pseudonymity. However, true anonymity – not leveraging real-world identity in some sense – becomes impossible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> without opening up the possibility of mass creation of automated trolls.</p> <p>In conclusion: free speech is not just about freedom from straight-forward censorship, but about your ability to participate in discourse without state interference. GPT-3 marks a new generation of tools enabling states to interfere in online discourse with unprecedented scale and persuasiveness, enabling great damage at low cost. It is clear that on the internet, AI will become indistinguishable from genuine humans in the next few years. To that extent, we have to protect our freedom of speech. It seems like requiring real-world IDs and coupling them with public key cryptography is the only way out, which keeps pseudonymity but loses anonymity.</p> <p>Losing anonymity to protect free speech is counter-intuitive and somewhat repulsive. I believe in individual freedom as the highest ideal. I used to think anonymity was one of the greatest values provided by the internet. And I acknowledge that eliminating anonymity to protect free speech comes with its own issues in the long run: for example, a malicious government could abuse the real-world-ID-to-private-key link to very effectively crack down on free speech. I don’t <em>like</em> the solution I am advocating, but it’s a difficult trade-off.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> DevOps doesn’t have to be all work and no play. I built 5 stupid (but fun!) GitHub actions… because <em>why not</em>?</p>
<p>The full code for these actions can all be found in this <strong><a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions">GitHub repo</a></strong>. I encourage you to fork and/or add issues/PRs with impractical actions of your own!</p>
<p>I also recorded a video about this project on <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-ugGAYVCo">YouTube</a></strong>. ← Check out the video and subscribe if you are into this sort of thing 🙏</p>

<h2 id="what-is-github-actions">What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It can be used to automate things such as building, testing, and deploying code and can be triggered by any GitHub event.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">marketplace</a> where developers can publish their actions for others to use.</p>
<p>While I have used many CI/CD systems including Jenkins, Google Cloud Build, and CircleCI, prior to this project I hadn’t explored GitHub Actions, so I thought I would try it out and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, let’s get to the stupid stuff!</p>
<h2 id="the-actions">The Actions</h2>
<h3 id="1----holiday-reminder">1 – Holiday Reminder</h3>
<p>Starting simple with this first action, I take advantage of the fact that actions can be triggered on a cron schedule to create the following 10 line action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: holiday-reminder-happy-new-year
<span>on</span>:
  <span>schedule</span>:
    - <span>cron</span>: <span>'0 0 1 1 *'</span>
<span>jobs</span>:
  <span>happy-new-year</span>:
    <span>runs-on</span>: ubuntu-latest
    <span>steps</span>:
    - <span>name</span>: throw error
      <span>run</span>: exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The action will run at midnight on New Year’s day and fail every time due to the non-zero exit code. This will cause GitHub to send me an email wishing me a Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉.</p>
<h3 id="2----recursive-action">2 – Recursive Action</h3>
<p>The next idea was proposed by a friend and former colleague (<a href="https://scotchka.github.io/)">https://scotchka.github.io/)</a>. He suggested that I make an action which triggers itself, thus creating an infinite chain of actions.</p>
<p>Given that the GitHub documentation explicitly states <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token">“To minimize your GitHub Actions usage costs, ensure that you don’t create recursive or unintended workflow runs,"</a> this seemed like a sufficiently stupid idea. To achieve this, I created an action triggered by commits that makes and commits a code change of its own.</p>
<p>There are two interesting parts to this action:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps prevent users from accidentally doing this by not triggering actions based on events associated with the default <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. In order to get around this, I created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">personal access token</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/sidpalas/stupid-actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/recursive.yml">action yaml file</a> for how this gets used.</li>
<li>In order to prevent the infinite action chain, I persist a count of the action executions within a file in the repo and increment it with each execution. This allows me to terminate the action chain when I reach a specified limit.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">COUNTER_FILE<span>=</span>./recursive/counter.txt
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>5</span>

count<span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat <span>"</span>$COUNTER_FILE<span>"</span><span>)</span> 
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    echo <span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span> &gt; $COUNTER_FILE
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e99a808da98d8c9f86999a8d809b8c8a9d809f8cc78a8684">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    git add $COUNTER_FILE
    git commit -m <span>"Incremented counter file"</span>
    git push 
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3----exponential-action">3 – Exponential Action</h3>
<p>The previous action has the potential to run indefinitely, but only one instance executes at a time, so it could be stopped manually if necessary. What if instead, the action triggered itself multiple times? This way, if it got out of hand there would be no stopping the exponential growth 😰. That sounds dumb… lets do it!</p>
<p>The file counter trick from before no longer works because multiple actions would be executing in parallel, all trying to modify and commit simultaneously causing conflicts. Instead, I stored the state in Git tags!</p>
<p>A random UUID is used as the base for the tag and the current iteration is appended to prevent collisions. The current implementation only support single digits, but if I make it past 9 iterations of exponential growth that means I messed up 💀.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>function</span> increment_tag_push <span>{</span>
    uuid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span>
    suffix<span>=</span><span>$((</span> $count <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>))</span>
    tag<span>=</span>$1.$uuid.$suffix
    git tag -a $tag -m <span>"New UUID tag"</span>
    git push origin $tag
<span>}</span>

count<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>echo -n $GITHUB_REF| tail -c 1<span>)</span><span>"</span>

echo $GITHUB_REF
echo $count

sleep <span>10</span> <span># In case something goes wrong (this saved me during development 😳)</span>
MAX_COUNT<span>=</span><span>2</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span> $count &gt; $MAX_COUNT <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
<span>then</span> 
    echo <span>"Count too high... exiting"</span>;
<span>else</span>
    echo <span>"Count okay... continuing"</span>;
    git config --global user.email <span>"<a href="https://devopsdirective.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="592a303d193d3c2f36292a3d302b3c3a2d302f3c773a3634">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    git config --global user.name <span>"sid"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 1; i &lt;<span>=</span> $1; i++ <span>)</span><span>)</span>;
    <span>do</span>
    increment_tag_push $i
    <span>done</span>
<span>fi</span>; 
</code></pre></div><p>If you are looking for a quick way to burn through your 2000 free tier minutes… this is definitely the way to go!</p>
<h3 id="4----smart-lights">4 – Smart Lights</h3>
<p>Thus far, these actions have been implemented in small bash scripts. In order to actually explore the capabilities of GitHub actions I decided the next action should utilize <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action">Docker</a>.</p>
<p>I had a couple of WiFi smart plugs from VeSync that I received as a gift a few years ago and found a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyvesync/">python client for their API</a>. This made it simple to create an action which turns the lights on for a short period of time after each commit (what better way to incentivize code velocity?!💡)</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/lights-off.gif" alt="images/lights-off.gif">
<figcaption>Lights on... Lights off!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The code for this one isn’t particularly interesting, but because the action is using more than just bash, it requires an <code>action.yml</code> file in which we can see how inputs get passed into the action:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>name</span>: <span>'Turn on Lights'</span>
<span>description</span>: <span>'Turn on smart home lights for a few seconds'</span>
<span>inputs</span>:
  <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>:  
    <span>description</span>: password for VESYNC_PASS
    <span>required</span>: <span>true</span>
<span>runs</span>:
  <span>using</span>: <span>'docker'</span>
  <span>image</span>: <span>'Dockerfile'</span>
  <span>env</span>:
    <span>VESYNC_PASS</span>: ${{ inputs.VESYNC_PASS }}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="5----tic-tac-toe">5 – Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>With the team starting to get a bit burnt out having to commit code constantly just to keep the lights on, I decided to implement a game of Tic-tac-toe to let them burn off some steam. The trick is that the computer player for this game executes within an action!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/07/stupid-github-actions/images/tic-tac-toe.png" alt="images/tic-tac-toe.png">
<figcaption>Command line interface + board state file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I wanted to try out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action">Javascript runtime</a>, so I built the game with Node, persisting the board state in a text file. Since the point of this game was to learn about actions the computer’s strategy is random, but this has the added benefit of letting the human win, boosting morale 🤔.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, GitHub Actions turned out to be fairly easy to work with and the option Dockerize the action steps ensures that it should be able to support pretty much any CI/CD need. Also, GitHub has made sharing and reuse of actions a core part of the experience through the Marketplace.</p>
<p>While I’m won’t be rushing off to port existing CI/CD workloads onto GitHub actions, I will certainly consider it for future greenfield projects!</p>

      <div><p>#SSSSS</p>
<p><em>Stupid</em>
<em>Simple</em>
<em>Static</em>
<em>Site</em>
<em>Starter</em></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: SSSSS requires that a markdown renderer be installed, and be
executable from a shell as 'markdown'. SSSSS assumes that the renderer will
only render exactly what is in the file, and not add anything like &lt;body&gt;
tags.</p>
<p>In addition to this assumption, SSSSS assumes that</p>
<pre><code>$ markdown file.md
</code></pre>
<p>will output the generated html to stdout.</p>
<p>EQUALLY IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT: SSSSS assumes that there is a POSIX sh at
/bin/sh. If there isn't, who knows what will happen, but probably not what
you want. In addition, s5-render does pass some user defined values to sh in
the form of path names. If you run it somewhere where a path includes valid
commands, you're gonna have a bad time.</p>
<hr>
<p>##About</p>
<p>This program will take a directory structure consisting of directories with
images and markdown files and render it to an html website.</p>
<p>The top level directory will include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The html-header.html (<code>&lt;!doctype&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags.)</li>
<li>The document-header.html (<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and whatever html you want to be included in the
header of your website.)</li>
<li>The document-footer.html (Your html for the footer, followed by <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When SSSSS renders a given Markdown file it will place the templates and
markdown in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>html-header.html</li>
<li>document-header.html</li>
<li>input.md</li>
<li>footer.html</li>
</ol>
<p>One final feature. If you put a document-header.html file in the <code>top</code>
directory or one of it's sub-directories, that document-header.html file will
be passed down the directory tree, in order to make things like a tabbed
interface require less JS and/or drudge work. If you use this feature, be aware
that if you put a document-header.html into a child directory, you need to put
one in the parent as well, or else sometimes the child will leak upwards.</p>
<p>This is a bug, but one that I've found easy enough to work around that I
haven't felt compelled to fix it yet. If at some point there is demand for
this, I may fix it.</p>
<hr>
<p>There must be exactly one markdown file in each directory of the structure that
SSSSS is called on. SSSSS will take this:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
  |- document-header.html
  |- index.md
  |
  \-about
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- about.md
  |
  \-blog
  | |- document-header.html
  | |- blog.md
  | |
  | \-post-one
  | | |- post-one.md
  | |
  | \-post-two
  |   |- post-two.md
  |
  \-other
    |- document-header.html
    |- other.md
</code></pre>
<p>and turn it to:</p>
<pre><code>DemoSite
|- html-header.html
|- document-header.html
|- footer.html
|
\-top
 |- document-header.html
 |- index.md
 |- index.html
 |
 \-about
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- about.md
 | |- index.html
 |
 \-blog
 | |- document-header.html
 | |- blog.md
 | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-one
 | | |- post-one.md
 | | |- index.html
 | |
 | \-post-two
 |   |- post-two.md
 |   |- index.html
 |
 \-other
   |- document-header.html
   |- other.md
   |- index.html
</code></pre>
<p>Although it seems strange that it would render every markdown file to a file
called index.html, there are actually two reasons. First, it allows you to have
nice looking URI's without needing to do any extra configuration in your
webserver. Second, it allows for less and simpler code, which makes this easier
to hack on for anyone who feels interested.</p>
<hr>
<p>##Tutorial</p>
<p>So you read through all that and still want to try this out? Cool. Start by
cloning this repository and installing some markdown program. After you have
done this, move the programs s5-generate.sh and s5-render into your path
somewhere, or just remember their fully qualified path.</p>
<p>Next, run</p>
<pre><code>$ s5-generate.sh HelloWorld
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new site called, you guessed it, HelloWorld. Move into the
HelloWorld directory you just created, you should see the template files
mentioned above, and a directory called top. The interior of top is where your
site will start.</p>
<p>Go ahead and cd yourself into top, and create a markdown file with content of
your choosing. I'm just going to go with a nice "Hello, World".</p>
<pre><code>file: WhateverNameYouWant.md
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#Hello, World!

Why does the world never say hello back?

</code></pre>
<p>After doing this, cd back up into the HelloWorld directory. Once there, run
s5-render and go back down into top. There should now be whatever markdown
file you created, along with an index.html file. Go ahead and play around
with changing the template files at the top, and look at how the outputed html
files change.</p>
<p>Presumably if you've found this, you know enough about computers to figure it
out from here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2 id="introducing-the-editor">Introducing the Editor</h2>
<p>Collaborative editors are defined by the size and speed of their
updates. On a website you might submit a form, but in a collaborative
editor you can send a single character or key press.</p>
<video controls="" width="100%">
    <source src="https://caolan.uk/articles/inside-a-collaborative-text-editor/google-docs-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>Those tiny edits are shared quickly so you feel connected to your
collaborators and can anticipate their actions. This experience is
described as <em>real-time</em> editing.</p>
<p>Inside your editor, however, the frequent edits form a hotbed of
conflicting updates. Solving or avoiding these conflicts is the real
challenge of a collaborative text editor.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>
<p>Taking turns, two authors might avoid a conflict - if they have the
patience.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/4154d7b675ec700e00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But our collaborative editor has many authors. To block one author's
key press until another releases their keyboard would be infuriating.
Instead, they each edit a copy of the document and submit changes
when ready.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/57a61b3a6fefc58700.png" title="Their legs are crossed. That's probably not obvious."></p>
<p>To submit, the first author can simply swap his copy for the
original - with no prior updates, his edits apply cleanly.</p>
<p>The second author, however, will find - in place of the original - the
first author's copy. Where she re-worded a sentence, he might have
deleted the whole paragraph. She cannot replace the document without
losing his work, so she must compare the two and decide how, and if,
her edits still apply.</p>
<p>Most collaborative editors do this automatically, behind the scenes,
for every change to a document.</p>
<h2 id="operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d16f9e7203a8563100.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of re-writing your edits to account for the work of others
is called <em>Operational Transformation</em>. It's the most popular way to
implement a collaborative editor and is used by Etherpad and Google
Docs.</p>
<p>Concrete examples will follow, but for now let's start with two
tubes: the kind you buy tennis balls in.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/155936b3bca3740700.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each tube has a starting state - a yellow ball - and each is held by a
different artist. At the same time, each artist adds a coloured ball
to the tube and informs their partner.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d4d34a8e9cee60a400.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing a yellow ball and a blue ball stacked on top, the right showing a red ball in place of blue. Beside the tubes are two artists saying 'blue' and 'red' respectively." title="We're not acorns, we're artists."></p>
<p>If they apply their partner's update naively, their tubes will look
different: red-blue-yellow one side and blue-red-yellow the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f4f128e9fa2cfce00.png" alt="Two tubes, the left showing from top to bottom: red, blue, yellow, the right: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>No single tube is correct - the colours were added simultaneously -
but the artists should agree a result.</p>
<p>To resolve the tie, they can invent an arbitrary rule. One that, when
applied by both artists, will arrive at the same state.
They could discard every ball… but the result is disappointing. How
about: "when inserts are tied, insert red before blue"?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/74a0a8e0c99fd7b500.png" alt="Two tubes, both showing from top to bottom: blue, red, yellow."></p>
<p>By applying the same rule their states <em>converge</em>. This is the
principle behind Operational Transformation and it can be applied to
many authors typing at once.</p>
<h2 id="handling-text">Handling text</h2>
<p>In a text document, you can improve such a rule by examining the
position of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/9ae873262f52072300.jpg" alt="Tama under a blanket with the caption 'sleepy cat'." title="Mraow"></p>
<p>Here's a photo of our cat Tama. I've labelled it "sleepy cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui (our other cat) both update my caption at different
positions. When Tama receives Yui's edit, she'll need to
shift Yui's "grumpy" right to account for her insert of "very".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f7a6a5a6edbee75500.png" alt="Two editors with the same state: very sleepy grumpy cat. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;grumpy &quot; 12'."></p>
<p>If she applied Yui's edit at its original character position, Tama
would have the state <strong>"very slgrumpy eepy cat"</strong>. But by understanding
how their concurrent edits affect one another, Tama's editor can
recover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't rely on position alone - what if they both
insert text at the same location?</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d56daf5a9e4e722f00.jpg" alt="Tama on top of the blanket with the caption &quot;Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Another photo, labelled simply: "Tama".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/086ae591d859549800.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;happy Tama&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama and Yui both make an edit at the beginning - position 0.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/819f09cfa16942c400.png" alt="Two editors showing a conflict. Tama has applied 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;playful happy Tama&quot;. Yui has applied 'INS &quot;happy &quot; 0' and has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Like our artists, Tama and Yui are tied for position. To resolve this,
we invent another arbitrary rule and order the inserts by Tama and
Yui's <em>editor ID</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8c2ab5057501f00500.png" alt="Two editors with the conflict resolved. Tama has applied the transformed message 'INS &quot;playful &quot; 6' and now also has the state &quot;happy playful Tama&quot;."></p>
<p>Yui has ID <code>[2]</code>, which is greater than Tama's <code>[1]</code>, so Tama
shifts Yui's insert after her own to converge on: <strong>"happy
playful Tama"</strong>.</p>
<p>We applied only two concurrent edits, but if Tama made multiple
changes, she would need to transform Yui's insert for each -
potentially shifting it multiple times before its final position.</p>
<p>I hope you feel confident after that, because - to demonstrate the
risks - I'm going to present a puzzle that threw the early algorithms
off-course.</p>
<h2 id="false-ties">False ties</h2>
<p><img alt="A photo of Yui with the caption 'little cat'." src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/750197ed186d7d3c00.jpg" title="Ah yes, all innocent - you wouldn't believe the noise."></p>
<p>The puzzle begins with a third author. And, since we only have two
cats - that's Yui above - I've introduced a fictional bunny: Bandit.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/f57d6afe96060d5d00.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;little loud cat&quot;. Bandit suggesting &quot;cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;cute little cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Bandit doesn't think Yui is small and deletes the word 'little'. After
applying all their edits, we expect the final caption to read: "cute
loud cat".</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/8bd6291f807f45ce00.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But there's a problem - because Bandit deletes the word separating
Tama and Yui's edits, a transform step might (falsely) tie them for
position. I'll demonstrate by stepping through Tama and Bandit's
transforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/d1431eaff0d5f1a600.png" alt="Tama applying 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 7', 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'DEL 5..12' to get the state &quot;cute loud cat&quot;."></p>
<p>Tama arrives at the correct result <strong>"cute loud cat"</strong> because she
applies Bandit's delete <em>after</em> her and Yui's inserts. Bandit,
however, applies his delete first.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/09c1793a9bf57cd800.png" alt="Bandit applying 'DEL 0..7', the transformed message 'INS &quot;loud &quot; 0', and the transformed message 'INS &quot;cute &quot; 0' to get the state &quot;loud cute cat&quot;."></p>
<p>His delete shifts Tama's "loud" to position 0. Yui's edit now ties
with Tama's, so Bandit must apply the arbitrary rule and order their
inserts by editor ID - <code>[1]</code> Tama's "loud", followed by <code>[2]</code> Yui's
"cute". Bandit incorrectly arrives at <strong>"loud cute cat"</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn't anticipate that you're in good company. Many academic
papers on Operational Transformation (OT) suffered similar
<em>counter-examples</em> (or bugs, to the practitioner) on publication.
Thankfully these puzzles have now been solved, as evidenced by the
widespread use of OT in the wild.</p>
<p>You can find the solution to our puzzle in the 30 years of OT research
since 1989. But to keep your curiosity in check, consider the
following: if an edit could be <em>undone</em>, conflicts could be rewound
and replayed in a fixed order. It's more work, and could still cause a
false tie, but at least everyone would encounter the <em>same</em> tie.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're now suitably paranoid. Operational Transformation is
easy to explain but complex to implement. If only there was a way to
avoid conflicts altogether…</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-conflicts">Avoiding conflicts</h2>
<p>Remember the two artists? I have another commission for them, this
time using coloured liquid instead of balls.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7039688af6d8494800.png" title="There are plenty of yellow liquids."></p>
<p>They each start with a tube containing yellow dye, to which they add
their own colours. Yellow and blue to make green; yellow and red to make
orange.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/48d447c836121b4600.png" alt="A blue drop being added to the left tube to make green. A red drop being added to the right tube to make orange."></p>
<p>Finally, they inform each other and add their partner's dye to their
own.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/35549bbf749c16a000.png" alt="A red drop being added to the left tube to make a sort of grey colour. A blue drop added to the right tube to make the same grew colour."></p>
<p>What a lovely colour! - but at least they didn't have to apply any
transforms to converge on it. Because the artists used liquid,
the order they added the dye is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Using a data type with the same property for text we could eliminate
conflicts there too.</p>
<h2 id="conflict-free-replicated-data-types">Conflict-free replicated data types</h2>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/7f664db5aa88a35300.png" alt="Tama suggesting &quot;very sleepy cat&quot;. Yui suggesting &quot;sleepy grumpy cat&quot;."></p>
<p>One elegant data type, called LOGOOT (an example of a conflict-free
replicated data type, or CRDT) is built upon each edit holding a
unique position - represented by a list of integers.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/1a9e80211f2fe7f900.png" alt="&quot;[10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>The list is comprised of: a positioning number, the author's editor
ID, and a counter.</p>
<p>Every edit increments the author's counter. In combination with their
editor ID, it ensures the position is unique. The positioning number
places the text in the document.</p>
<p>To insert a word at the beginning of the document (before "sleepy")
Tama <code>[1]</code> would create a new position list that starts with a random
value between 0 and 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/db8ec7b35046ae4700.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>Yui <code>[2]</code>, unable to generate an integer between 10 and 11, chooses a
new random positioning number and appends her values to the preceding
list. By growing the list, Yui can always find a position between two
adjacent words.</p>
<p><img src="https://caolan.uk/processed_images/e74bdd81e27aab8200.png" alt="&quot;[6, 1, 1] VERY, [10, 0, 1] SLEEPY, [10, 0, 1, 130, 2, 1] GRUMPY, [11, 0, 2] CAT&quot;"></p>
<p>You can insert these four words - ordered by their position lists - in
any sequence. You'll always arrive at the same result.</p>
<p>The example above uses a position list per word, but you'll probably
want a position list per <em>character</em> - occupying significantly more
space than the text alone in exchange for predictable performance.</p>
<p>Praise for the performance of CRDTs often rests on the worst-case
scenario: a long conflicting history of edits. In practice,
Operational Transformation can perform millions of simple transforms a
second and grants greater freedom to optimise the data structure - so
you might find OT performs better where fast feedback and short
conflicting histories are the norm.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using a modified version of LOGOOT. In the end,
what convinced me was, not performance, but greater confidence that my
code is correct.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>It seems incredible that, after 30 years of research, many products
still restrict work to a single author or just lose overlapping edits.
If, instead, we apply techniques to detect, avoid, and resolve
conflicts, we <em>can</em> write good collaborative software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in March, my kids were super excited for a few days off for their Spring Break. I took a week off so I could be home with them and not have to worry about work. I still haven’t been back to the office, and they haven’t been back to their school.</p>

<p>I doubt there’s anybody that’s not aware of the current world situation regarding COVID-19. In March, my kids’ school decided that the risk of having all those kids in one place was too great, and they moved to a “School from Home” setup. My work did pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been pretty fortunate in that my work supports a “From Home” option, and I’ve been full time from home before. I was already setup to do anything and everything I needed to do for my job right from my house.</p>

<p>My company offered basic supplies to take home if we needed them. Keyboards, mice, monitors, even chairs. I passed on pretty much all of that because I already have a good setup at home to work with. My laptop is all I need to work from pretty much anywhere in my house.</p>

<p>It’s been four months now. I confess, I’m burning out.</p>

<p>I recently attended a conference called SRE From Home, which was really interesting to me. One of the things said in one of the presentations stuck with me. To paraphrase, the reason we’re all burning out isn't because we’re working from home, it’s because we’re living at work.</p>

<p>That really struck home for me. I took a step back and really looked at how I’ve been doing this.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, I got up in the morning at a fixed time. I showered, got myself and my kids fed, the kids off to school, and then I drove in to work. I plopped my laptop down on my desk at work and <em>that</em> is when my work day started. I did my job until the end of the day, and then I packed up my stuff into my laptop bag and I drove home. I picked up my kids, got dinner ready, did homework with them, and got them to bed. I’d sit with my wife on our couch and watch a TV show or two and then go to bed.</p>

<p>Now, during the pandemic, my schedule is entirely different. I still get up at a fixed time, but the kids don’t go to school and I don’t go to work. I walk the required fifteen steps from my bedroom to my office and I plop down at my desk with my computer already running and open. It never closes anymore. It’s always there. I go grab a quick lunch, but rarely actually take a lunch <em>break</em>. I eat in my office at my desk. When my kids come grab me to tell me they’re hungry, I fix them something to eat, and then I’m right back at my desk. Dinner time roles around, and it’s the same routine. Even after they’ve gone to bed, the computer is still there, open and waiting. I’ll check my email in the evening and manage some small tasks right up until the point I go to bed.</p>

<p>Looking at this now, I realize that I <em>never stop</em> working. If I’m awake, I’m at work.</p>

<p>This is something I’m going to have to change.</p>

<p>I did something different today. I have to work tomorrow for server upgrades, so I “left” early. I closed my laptop down at three o’clock, and I went and took a nap. I haven’t looked at my computer since. It’s still sitting there on the desk, but the lid is closed, and I’m not going to open it until tomorrow night for the upgrades. When those are done, the lid will close again, and I’m sleeping in on Monday.</p>

<p>There are four hours of work scheduled for me Saturday night to Sunday morning, and those are not going to be “Free Work Hours”.</p>

<p>I need to start setting boundaries. There needs to be a line between “work” and “not work”. If I can’t draw that line, I’m going to drive myself crazy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have wanted to build a social network for 8 years, but it was much harder to
make software for the web back then. Also, 8 years ago, I was not even a
software developer yet, so there is that. But now I am (thanks
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp.org</a>!), and we are living in the
easiest time to be a software developer since Jeff Goldblum uploaded a virus to
an alien mothership.</p>
<h2>Quid Sentio</h2>
<p>The time was kind to my idea of what a social network should be too. It aged
well, and now it's time to uncork it. I am building <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/">Quid
Sentio</a>, a shareable personal journal. I am not
calling it a social network site, but it is. Well, it will be. It's just the
basics now but open in public beta in the hopes someone will care.</p>
<p>What I am building now is much more mature than what I envisioned back then. The
core idea is the same -- keeping in touch with real friends, the closest friends
and family-- but the foundation is much more robust these days. In the meantime,
Path has come and gone, people saying they have quit Facebook have come and
gone, data leaks and privacy abuses have come and stayed.</p>
<p>I want to build Quid Sentio upon the principle of privacy. Privacy as freedom
from being observed. From being observed by non-friends, from being observed by
companies, from being observed by people who bought your data in the deep web
after a database leak.</p>
<p>The first two are just consequences of design and business choices. Adding a
little bit of friction for adding friends -- so no one can spam-add all their
contact list; keeping shared posts visible only by your direct friends -- so no
virality or friends of friends stalking you. A subscription-based business model
-- so no ads, no invasive tracking. The third level of privacy is not that
simple.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is one thing that gets harder and harder to do in software
development. At the same time, services that do it better than me are more
accessible. This is the first reason why I decided to build my project using
other people's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The second reason is that I want to limit how many things I have to juggle in my
mind while building it. I read in Sapiens that the Cognitive Revolution started
70,000 years ago. I am pretty sure it ended when I made 40. Some things look
attractive from afar, but I can pass without them, and I am happy enough just
hearing people talking about it. Things that fall into that bucket are Finnegans
Wake, EVE Online, Dwarf Fortress, and Vim. Other things I cannot pass by
without, and I have no idea how to do it myself.</p>
<p>The inevitable implication is that I had to find other people to do my job for
me. I wanted to focus on building the UI, creating the application logic,
designing the experience that would make my product unique. Not the devops, not
the infra, not the data plumbing, none of those solved problems. I found people
that do these better than I could possibly ever do in Netlify and FaunaDB. There
is also other software taken for granted that are worthy, but not newsworthy at
this point. Like Stripe, AWS S3, and the plethora of open-source software that
are the buried giants whose shoulders I am standing on while pretending to be in
a mountain that I climbed all by myself.</p>
<p>Economics teaches you about comparative advantage. People in those companies
have the advantage of being smart; I have the advantage of using their service's
free tiers. Not sure I got that economics thing right.</p>
<p>The defining technical characteristic of my application is using good things
with bad names. I built it on a serverless architecture, which is the same as
calling food delivery "kitchenless food". I am using JAMstack, which is an
acronym for static websites or dynamic web apps using a stack with Javascript,
APIs and markup language but not like all those other websites and web apps that
also use Javascript, APIs and markup language in a totally different way. I
would be much happier calling serverless architecture, “Boaty”, and JAMstack,
“McBoatface”.</p>
<p>Still, just like Panama hats from Ecuador, they are great things. They are
powerful ideas, implemented, and popularized by great companies that I am using
to build mine.</p>
<h3>Netlify Build and Netlify Functions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is famous for how simple and intuitive it is
to create static sites that have hosting, continuous deployment, and CDN without
any hassle. With Netlify Functions, I can go one step further; I can make my
React site a dynamic application using APIs. Their serverless Functions make
creating an API a breeze; I drop a javascript function in a folder, deploy, and
I have an API.</p>
<p>Serverless is great for its smaller upfront costs (for low traffic, you are
usually still in free tier range) and zero infrastructure management needs.
Pay-as-you-go is a risk if you go too fast, but that’s not something I am
expecting. With Netlify Functions encapsulating the not that simple AWS Lambda
Functions, it has the extra bonus of keeping me away from the AWS Management
Console interface.</p>
<p>I have a fast CRUD app deployed in my domain, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>
<p><a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> is a distributed NoSQL database that is very well
suited to plug into serverless applications. NoSQL, with its flexible schema, is
a blessing for building new projects that will change a lot and quickly. I am
not building a typical social network; I am implementing original ideas that
might or might not work, that have changed and will continue to change as my own
ideas evolve and I get users' feedback. The data structure will reflect that. I
am a Javascript developer; I like how javascript notates its objects; it is
easier for me to understand and change a JSON object. It is also the obvious
solution for going serverless.</p>
<p>I have a safe, reliable, and fast database, with minimal cognitive overhead.</p>
<p><em>update: In the first version of this post I was using Userbase as
authentication solution. Since then, I decided to concentrate more on FaunaDB
tech, including their built-in user authentication.</em></p>
<h3>Putting everything to work</h3>
<p>Quid Sentio core entity is the journal entry. An entry can contain text, audio
recorded by the user, an image, a mood number selected from a range from -100 to
100, and custom tags. Each entry can also be shared and commented by friends.
This data looks like this for the user:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-01.png" alt="Text entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-02.png" alt="Audio entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-03.png" alt="Image entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-04.png" alt="Mood entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-05.png" alt="Tags entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-06.png" alt="Sharing entry screenshot">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-demo-07.png" alt="Commenting entry screenshot"></p>
<p>The entry data is pretty suitable for a JSON structure, as I have to fit all of
these, with its inherent grouping, in one database item. Images and audios are
stored at AWS S3, their URLs are stored at the database item too.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that I can -- and I will -- add more types of content that
the user can add to an entry. Audio, image, and custom tags were all added after
I launched the alpha version. I still consider video, maybe stickers, or other
more creative inputs that I learn from my users. The flexibility of adding more
properties to an entry while keeping it backward-compatible comes much more
naturally to NoSQL.</p>
<p>Quid Sentio is also social. The user creates an entry in their journal and can
then choose with whom, among their friends, they want to share it and allow to
comment on it. The user will also view all of their friends’ entries that were
shared with them. Each entry contains its permissions of access and list of
comments.</p>
<p>I keep the user’s list of friends as one of the profile properties that I keep
in a "Users" collection in FaunaDB. After user authentication I can access it
and then I can keep it in the state of my application. It is basically a list of
userIds, so no big deal. The tricky thing is to make the request that returns
only the entries from those friends who are authorized to be seen by the user.</p>
<p>This is where FQL shines. FQL is FaunaDB’s own query language, but I could use
GraphQL (also supported by FaunaDB) with similar results. I can easily create a
query from a Netlify Function that only brings the authorized entries without
the need of writing a lot of code with the logic required to not expose
unauthorized entries to the client. So it ends up being pretty fast and simple
to get the user’s friends’ entries and show this:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had many technical obstacles between me and the social network that I wanted
to build. Then modern services started to arrive, one by one, and, with more
ease than expected, I got it done. I create-react-apped an app, deployed with
Netlify, wrote Netlify functions for the basic operations, integrated with
Fauna's NoSQL serverless database, including its built-in user authentication,
inserted a Stripe handled checkout page and voilà. The only thing in front of me
now is my vision. And I have all my cognitive resources preserved to reach it.
Or to be consumed trying to write smart comments on Hacker News. Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>My brain basks in this planning process. It feels so productive, but it involves minimal mental effort.</p>
<p>Time and time again this cycle occurs. When it comes to getting down to real work, the euphoric rush fades. It turns out planning is easy and action is hard.</p>
<p>Before long, my interest dies down and it’s onto the next topic. And so the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This happened until I heard a story of two men learning to fish. The first fisherman heads to the marina and buys the best fishing boat money can buy. He specs out a custom carbon fiber rod and spends thousands on a deep-water GPS. He spends time reading up on different casting, reeling, and baiting techniques. A few months later, he feels ready to fish.</p>
<p>But by the time he casts his first line, the second fisherman has sucked the lake dry. </p>
<p>On day one, the second fisherman grabbed a shitty rod, sliced up a hot dog, and started fishing. Every day he honed his technique, finding bait which worked a little better or a spot that had a few more nibbles. After three weeks of iteration, he found the winning combo.</p>
<p>Before long, he was hauling in hundreds of fish every day. From there he opened a restaurant to sell his fresh fish. And then he opened a fishing school to teach others his craft. All while the first fisherman gathered gear.</p>
<p>The moral of this story?</p>
<p>Get to action as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong> When you find yourself gathering gear, grab a shitty rod and start fishing.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a minimal static website and blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and deploy it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. To goal is to start simple with a minimal set of features and add more functionality later as needed. I will also explain why I decided to use a static site generator and why I chose Pelican. If you are not interested in the first part, you can directly jump to the <a href="#how-to">How To section</a> of the tutorial.</p>

    </a></p><p>The I Want To Read More website generated with Pelican</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Why static site generator?</h2>
<p>When I <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog/building-a-product-in-the-open/">started building I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to launch a prototype quickly <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/building-the-prototype" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a>, so I could validate the idea. This meant avoiding as much complexity as possible. Using a static site generator and going serverless <a href="#" data-vote="haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/buidling-serverless" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Click if you want me to write more about this topic in the future.">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 22 27" style="height: 1em; width: 0.815em">
        <circle r="5" cx="11" cy="5"></circle><rect ry="1.5" x="3" y="9" height="18" width="16" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:1.5"></rect><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="3" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse><ellipse rx="3" ry="4" cx="19" cy="18.5" style="stroke:#fff;stroke-width:2"></ellipse>
    </svg>
</a> seemed like the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p>A static site generator uses template files to define the structure and design of the site. The content, like for example the blog posts, is stored separately, usually in Markdown format. When the generator builds the site, the final HTML files are generated by combining the templates and the content files. This allows you to avoid code duplication and to be able to focus on the content when writing. Many static site generators are explicitly focused on blogs.</p>
<p>The big advantage of statically generated sites is that their hosting is simple and cheap. The web server simply needs to serve the generated HTML pages. Compared to dynamic content management systems (CMS), like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>, static sites are safer, faster and consume less resources. That's why you can find many static site hosting providers that offer generous free plans like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">AWS S3</a>. Dynamic sites are usually either paid (<a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) or offer a more limited free tier. For example, using the free plan, you cannot have a custom domain on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> and have very limited bandwidth on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>.</p>
<p>Some more advanced features may be easier to implement in a CMS, like for example sophisticated publishing systems. Our goal here, though, is to get something up and running quickly and cheaply.</p>
<p>You will also need some technical knowledge to set everything up, but the effort is worth it. It this tutorial I will show you how you can remove a lot of the complexity in the process. I will also provide you with templates so you can create a simple site with a blog with minimal effort.</p>
<h2>Why I chose Pelican?</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of static site generators, so how do you choose one? My approach here was to go for one that is implemented in a language I'm already familiar with. While you will not need to write code to configure the generator, you will probably have some experiences with the tools of the particular language. I decided to go with a Python based static site generator, but here are some ideas for other languages as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python - <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>, <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a></li>
<li>Ruby - <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/">Bridgetown</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a></li>
<li>JavaScript - <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to consider is if the site generator has a particular focus. Some are more suitable for blogs, while other specialize in project documentation. Choose one that is suitable for your use case. For <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> it was important for me to be able to easily create static pages and a blog.</p>
<p>When choosing a framework, I like to choose a mature and popular project. Such projects have the advantage that there will be a big community and you will easily find solutions to common problems. If you need some specific feature, though, it may be worth checking some of the more specialized options.</p>
<p>I recommend checking <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>, which is a list of static site generators. You can filter the different projects by their programming language and compare them by popularity and specialization.</p>

    </a></p><p>Choosing a static site generator on StaticGen</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After I compared the different Python options, I decided to go with <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. Another popular Python generator is <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>, but it seems to be specialized for project documentation, instead on blogs. <a href="https://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a href="https://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> had much less start on GitHub, which I find to be a good proxy for popularity.</p>
<p>In the next section, I will go through the steps that you need to do in order to create a minimal static site with a blog using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. I will also show you how to deploy the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> using the free plan.</p>

<h2>How to create a static site and a blog with Pelican?</h2>
<p>I found Pelican's default configuration and theme a bit overwhelming for a simple website. There are just too many features and options that you don't need in the beginning. So, I created a configuration that is stripped down to only the most important things. I personally like an iterative approach, where I quickly create something working end-to-end and build on top of it.</p>
<p>I went through the code of the default <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/notmyidea-cms"><code>notmyidea</code></a> theme and stripped it down as much as possible. You can find the code of my <code>minimal</code> theme in the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. This is the branch where the basic website is created and you can use it as a template for creating your own. Note, that this branch was merged into <code>master</code> and deployed in production. This is really the code used for the <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read Mode</a> website.</p>

    </a></p><p>The minimal website code on GitHub</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>1. Install Pelican</h3>
<p>You can easily install Pelican with <code>pip</code>. You should also choose what markup language you want to use for your content. Pelican supports both <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, but I went with Markdown since I'm already familiar with it.</p>
<pre><code>pip install pelican markdown
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Create a Pelican project.</h3>
<p>After Pelican is installed, you can create a new project with the <code>pelican-quickstart</code> tool:</p>
<pre><code>pelican-quickstart
</code></pre>

<p>It will ask you several questions like website title, author and URL. You should answer yes to the generation of automation scripts, because they will be useful, when deploying on Netlify. The tool will also offer you configuration for different ways of uploading your website. I rejected all of them because the deployment on Netlify can be easily done when pushing to the git repository. Here is my log of setting up <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to pelican-quickstart v4.2.0.

This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.

Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files
needed by Pelican.

&gt; Where do you want to create your new web site? [.] .
&gt; What will be the title of this web site? I Want To Read More
&gt; Who will be the author of this web site? Vladimir Haltakov
&gt; What will be the default language of this web site? [en] en
&gt; Do you want to specify a URL prefix? e.g., https://example.com   (Y/n) Y
&gt; What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) https://iwanttoreadmore.com
&gt; Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) n
&gt; What is your time zone? [Europe/Paris] 
&gt; Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) Y
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Dropbox? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using S3? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using Rackspace Cloud Files? (y/N) n
&gt; Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) n
</code></pre>

<p>The newly created Pelican site will contain several folders and files that form the skeleton of your site. The following are the most important:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>content</code> - this is where you put your blog articles. You can also add the images that you will include in your posts here.</li>
<li><code>themes</code> - here you have the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> template files that will be used to generate the HTML code as well as your static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript). There are many <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes#pelican-themes">predefined Pelican themes</a>, but you will probably want to create a specific one for your website. It is a good idea to start from an existing theme and modify it.</li>
<li><code>pelicanconf.py</code> - the main configuration file of your site. Here, you can set variables to configure the different Pelican features.</li>
<li><code>publishconf.py</code> - configuration that applies when building the site for publishing.</li>
<li><code>output</code> - the folder where all the generated files will be stored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Adapting the theme.</h3>
<p>At this stage, you can take my <code>minimal</code> theme as a basis and change it to fit your website. It is stripped down to the most important features and it will allow you to start quickly. You can get the code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/tree/minimalistic_pelican_site/website">here</a>. Below, I will describe how I created it.</p>
<h3>4. Disabling unneeded features.</h3>
<p>I first disabled the generation of several blog pages that I don't need, like for example the archives, tags, categories or authors pages. This can be done in the <a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/8070dba10d73478866bda8ae64d898e0634de5cd/website/pelicanconf.py#L38"><code>pelicanconf.py</code></a> file.</p>
<pre><code># Disable unneeded blog features
ARCHIVES_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHOR_SAVE_AS = ""
AUTHORS_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORY_SAVE_AS = ""
CATEGORIES_SAVE_AS = ""
TAGS_SAVE_AS = ""
</code></pre>

<p>Removing these pages means that you don't have to take care of designing the templates for them in your theme. You can of course enable them again later if needed.</p>
<h3>5. Adapting the templates.</h3>
<p>After removing most blog pages, there are only 3 templates that I needed to adapt to my website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/base.html"><code>base.html</code></a> - this template defines the structure of every page. It contains the common header, navigation bar and footer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a> - this is your blog's index page, that contains a list of all your articles. While it is possible to have some featured articles on top, I removed them for now in order to keep things simple.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/haltakov/iwanttoreadmore/blob/minimalistic_pelican_site/website/themes/minimal/templates/article.html"><code>article.html</code></a> - this is the template used to render a blog post. It is a small wrapper around the actual text of the article coming from the Markdown files in the <code>content</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Creating static pages outside the blog.</h3>
<p>The default Pelican setup assumes that your website's index will be your blog's index page. However, for <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/">I Want To Read More</a> I wanted to have a landing page that describes the product. The blog is available at <a href="https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog">https://iwanttoreadmore.com/blog</a>.</p>
<p>To achieve this, you first need to create the template for your landing page …</p></div></div>

<p>With Software as a Service (SaaS) spawning an entire cottage industry of *aaS, it is fair to wonder if some Silicon Valley startup with try and market themselves as becoming a Farming as a Service operation. One key problem is…FaaS has basically been around for decades, albeit with a less slick name: custom farming. </p>



<p>“Custom Farming” is basically an umbrella term for any operation a producer pays for or offers service for in addition to their own operation. Its so ubiquitous that Universities in the Midwest routinely take <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/html/a3-10.html">surveys</a> to track pricing and monitor changes over years. Need someone to plant a field for you because you are overextended? According to the linked survey, you will look to pay around ~$25 depending on various options.  Agriculture in the U.S. is not in need of a FaaS startup to disrupt the status quo because a very healthy market already exists. As a plus for farmers (and a hindrance to founders looking for walled-garden approaches), the market is very transparent with several Universities publishing annuals surveys to reflect local fluctuations.</p>



<p>That said, the friction could be improved. With most things having an online presence and as farming communities becoming less face-to-face, perhaps an online (and real-time) marketplace connecting people who want work done posting bids and people who can work posting asks for various calendar-dependent activities. One way SV businesses to connect with the Midwest would be Imagery As a Service (IaaS). Farmers have access to drones and satellite imagery from seed and chemical companies (often at a cost $$$), but these seed and chemical companies have access to the same satellite and imagery systems as SV does (I am not aware of an agriculture company launching their own satellite with proprietary sensors). Working with imagery is a well honed skill for many data scientists and automating it into some sort of IaaS for farmers may be an interesting startup or side hustle. </p>



<p>How cool would it be to just upload some GPS coordinates for a field, pay $5 and get the <em>literal</em> most up-to-date image without driving out to the field (although half the fun of farming <em>is</em> going to the field!)? So if you see a startup marketing itself as FaaS, just know that has already been done and all you are paying for is added overhead!</p>

					<p>Ever tried dealing with a large company, only to get stonewalled? You're talking to a black box that repeats “Sorry, that’s against policy” or “I can’t do that”</p><p>But if you can open up that box the picture changes. The moving pieces become visible. Watch how each one ticks, and you’ll start noticing the systems at play.</p><p>Leaders design incentives to be armor plating for the company, protecting its interests.

You know them as customer service. &nbsp;Depending on whether you’re that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">company’s customer or their product</a>, customer service’s role varies from “keep them happy with minimal effort” to “get these people off our backs.” They’re the ones companies want you to contact.</p><p>When customer service isn’t being that helpful, look for someone else to complain to. Like the CEO.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is famous for reading all customer emails sent directly to him.

Propelling it faster and faster and faster till it smashed into my team’s inbox at critical velocity. All hands on deck!</p><p>Why did &nbsp;this work? Look at what’s happening behind the scenes. Your message went to someone with just enough time to say "This might be important, I’ll delegate it to the relevant team." And it gets fast tracked through the chain of command</p><p>A funny bit of management psychology comes into play here: If your boss’s boss’s boss tells you to “look into this please,” it jumps to top of your priority list. Usually folks don’t bother to ask if it should be prioritized higher or lower than the large pile already on their plate.</p><p>Achievement unlocked: Teleport to front of line.</p><p>Many businesses have departments tasked with nothing but creating rules other departments must follow. Some of those rules get really weird:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m continuously amazed by how many people have to ask permission to buy a $50 book, yet are empowered to call a meeting that costs tens of thousands of dollars.</p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1103868678389420033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Once I was going on a business trip to help with a conference. My company had instituted a hotel budget of $250 per day. But this was a BIG conference. Hotel prices were jacked up, and only the sketchiest places met that price point.</p><p>The cheaper hotels were 30 minutes away, but then I’d blow the budget for uber rides. I asked if I'd have to cancel my conference trip.</p><p>Manager: “There’s not actually an uber limit”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>I booked that distant hotel and took an uber everyday. Now here’s the kicker: the hotel + uber cost <em>more </em>than what I would have paid if I had gotten a hotel walking distance from the venue. But that’s too complicated for the finance department to write formal rules around. Imagine if they prevented people from getting a ride when it was <em>really </em>needed!</p><p>Thus the current policy was born.</p><p>It gets better. When you see the policy’s red lines drawn out, you can walk around them like Danny Ocean’s crew navigating a laser maze. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mr834Cs9ncs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Good sales reps know this and use it to push deals through. Patrick McKenzie <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1284404823572410369">offers an example</a>:</p><p><em>"Suppose you are selling a $100k product to a director who has $100k budgeted for it. You do the dance. Purchasing says they need a 10% discount because We're Big Enough To Always Demand One.</em></p><p><em>Three days later you submit the following: $100k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year of SaaS services. Comes out of software budget. $12k invoice, discounted 10%, for 1 year commitment to professional services. Comes out of consulting budget.</em></p><p><em>Purchasing is *extremely* likely to approve this."</em></p><p>Did the company hire people who couldn’t do basic math? Of course not.</p><p>They pay people who know <em>where their time will be most valuable</em>. Writing a policy that covers 95% of situations will take them 10 hours and saves the companies $XX millions of dollars. Writing policies to cover the remaining 5% will take ten times as long and only offer a tiny fraction of the savings. The cost/benefit analysis doesn’t work out.</p><p>If you learn what was left in that missing 5% you'll have the advantage.</p><p>Remember there is no “company.” All of the company’s decisions are actually individuals acting within their own set of incentives. The “company” is what emerges when those individual incentives interact with each other.</p><p>You don’t have to fight the entire company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/there-is-no-spoon.png" alt=""><figcaption>There is no company</figcaption></figure><p>Hidden incentives exist in your own company too. Is a team resisting doing something you’re asking for? Learn why. Find the fulcrum point. New paths will emerge.</p><p>For example, I used to struggle with people not responding to my emails when I tried to get their approval on a change I was making. “People are busy,” my manager explained. “Instead say, ‘I’ll be making this change on Thursday unless you object before then.’” </p><p>I started doing that.</p><p>The objections were rare. The complaints, non-existent.</p><div><p>You get the best results when you adapt your approach to the person you’re facing</p><p>Now replace "person" with "team" or "department"</p><p>The sentence remains true</p></div><p>Figuring out each team's incentives can <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer#research-like-a-detective">take some detective work</a>. But once you understand them you’ll learn what makes each group tick. As you get better at this you’ll find yourself able to collaborate with others much more effectively and Get Stuff Done.</p>

		<p><em>See <a href="https://www.ollielovell.com/ollielearns/spaced-repetition-incremental-reading-anki-dendro/">this post</a> on how I now combine spaced repetition software with incremental reading software to supercharge my learning! If you haven’t heard of Anki before you may like to read my intro to it <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/tot/spaced-repetition-software-the-most-efficient-way-to-remember-anything/">here</a>, how I’ve been using it in my classes <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/olliesclassroom/instructional-approach-2017/">here</a>, or the previous post in this series on Anki advanced use <a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/edtech/anki2/">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Cloze deletion is a highly effective way of studying content, and making flash cards.</p>
<p>Imagine there’s a question that you would like to be able to remember and recall.</p>
<blockquote><p>in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the Sputnik 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cloze deletion allows you to set up Anki cards where some of the key information is blanked out, and your job is to retrieve it. The above sentence could end up looking like this in a cloze deletion card.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ____, the&nbsp;____________ launched the world’s first artificial satellite, the ___________.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1, Simple cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1392166854">Cloze Deletion Single Card</a>&nbsp;Anki add-on. this allows you to make simple, single cards. Sometimes you might want to have multiple cloze deletions in a single card, or make different cloze deletions appear for different cards, based upon the same core phrase or piece of information. The following video clearly shows how to do this. <span id="more-1818"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRY1rYxd9EM?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Method 2, Cloze deletion and type the answer</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to ensure that you know how to spell the missing words correctly (e.g., Sputnik vs. Sputnic), in this case, it could be helpful to set up anki so that you have to&nbsp;<em>type</em> the answer in. The following video shows you how to do this.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Before you edit the card template (i.e., type in the code) it’s important that you clone the ‘cloze’ card type, otherwise you’ll modify all cloze deletion cards that you have. I’ve included some screenshots at the bottom of this post to show you how to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, The code given by the person in the video isn’t complete. See the info and the screenshot below this vid to see how exactly to set it up.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnrigOzpJQo?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the front you should have: {{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}</p>
<p>On the back you should have:&nbsp;{{cloze:Text}}&lt;br&gt;{{type:cloze:Text}}{{Extra}}</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1829"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-03-10 at 3.57.29 pm" width="592" height="535" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm.png 592w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-10-at-3.57.29-pm-300x271.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3, Image Occlusion for cloze deletion</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, such as when you are using info from slides and you’re having issues with the formatting of mathematical equations and the like, it may be better off to just take a screenshot of the info and create cloze deletions from the image itself. This would be helpful if you were trying to remember a list of info, such as is demonstrated in the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1819"><img src="http://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png" alt="Ollie Lovell, Oliver Lovell, Anki, Cloze deletion" width="732" height="371" srcset="https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion.png 732w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-300x152.png 300w, https://www.ollielovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ollie-Lovell-Oliver-Lovell-Anki-Cloze-deletion-624x316.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px"></a></p>
<p>In a case like this you can use the<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094"> image occlusion enhanced</a> add-on, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYAMkwBdOas?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" title=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just include the formula part as a screenshot, and use the cloze deletion function on the screenshot. Anki has no issue using cloze deletion on the images : )</p>
<p><strong>Method 4, Cloze Overlapper (more detailed and complex)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969733775">TheCloze Overlapper</a>&nbsp;Anki addon is good for longer lists of info. A great tutorial video for this is shown below. Happy studying!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
				<!-- To a functional programmer like me, every programming language is a functional language. --> 

<p>Functional programming is a style of programming and modern languages support this style to a greater or lesser extent. In this article I want to explain how programming in a functional style provides you with powerful abstractions to make your code cleaner. I will illustrate this with examples in Raku and Python, which as we will see are both excellent languages for functional programming.</p>

<h2>Raku: a quick introduction</h2>

<p>The code examples in this article are written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a>. I assume most people are familiar with Python, but Raku is less well known, so I will explain the basics first. The code in this article is not very idiomatic so you should be able to understand it easily if you know another programming language.</p>

<p>Raku is most similar to <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. Both languages are syntactically similar to C/C++, Java and JavaScript: block-based, with statements separated by semicolons, blocks demarcated by braces, and argument lists in parentheses and separated by commas. The main feature that sets Perl and Raku apart from other languages is the use of sigils ('funny characters') which identify the type of a variable: <code>$</code> for a scalar, <code>@</code> for an array, <code>%</code> for a hash (map) and <code>&amp;</code> for a subroutine. Variables also have keywords to identify their scope, I will only use <code>my</code> which marks the variable as lexically scoped. A subroutine is declared with the <code>sub</code> keyword, and subroutines can be named or anonymous:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>sub</span> <span>square</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>my</span> <span>$anon_square</span> = <span>sub</span> (<span>$x</span>) {
    <span>$x</span>*<span>$x</span>;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python this would be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>

<span># anonymous subroutine </span>
<span>anon_square</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!-- Raku also has [twigils](https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#index-entry-Twigil), secondary sigils that influence the scoping of a variable. For this article, the only twigil used in the code is `.` which is used to declare a role or class attribute with automatically generated accessors (like `$.notes` in the example below). -->

<p>Raku supports sigil-less variables, and uses the <code>\</code> syntax to declare them. For more on the difference between ordinary and sigil-less variables, see <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/variables#Sigilless_variables">the Raku documentation</a>. For example (<code>say</code> prints its argument followed by a newline):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>x</span> = <span>42</span>; <span># sigilless</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$y</span> = <span>43</span>; 
<span>say</span> <span>x</span> + <span>$y</span>; 
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the code in this article, I will use the sigil-less variables whenever possible.</p>

<p>Raku has several types of sequence data structures. In the code below I will use <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/list">lists and arrays</a> and <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Range">ranges</a>. The main difference between a list and an array in Raku is that a list is immutable, which means that once created, it can't be modified. So it is a read-only data structure. To 'update' an immutable data structure, you need to create an updated copy. Arrays on the other hand are mutable, so we can update their elements, extend them, shrink them etc. All updates happen in place on the original. </p>

<p>Raku's arrays are similar to Python's lists and Raku's lists are similar to Python's tuples, which are also immutable. Apart from the syntax, ranges in Raku are similar to ranges in Python, and both are immutable.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>@array1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array because of the '@' sigil</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>array2</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>]; <span>#=&gt; an array, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>range1</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@array3</span> = <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>; <span>#=&gt; an array from a range, because of the '@' sigil</span>

<span>my</span> \<span>list1</span> = <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>; <span>#=&gt; a list</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$list2</span> = (<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>); <span>#=&gt; also a list</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>list3</span> = |(<span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>);  <span>#=&gt; an array from a range because of the '|' flattening operation</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent Python code would be</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>list1</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>))</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a tuple</span>
<span>list2</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>];</span> <span>#=&gt; a list, because of the '[...]'</span>

<span>range1</span> <span>=</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; a range 1 .. 10</span>
<span>list3</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>));</span> <span>#=&gt; a list from a range</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Other specific bits of syntax or functionality will be explained for the particular examples. </p>

<h2><em>A function, by any other name</em> — functions as values</h2>

<p>Functions are the essence of functional programming. As I explained in my article <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function">"Everything is a function"</a>, in a proper functional language, all constructs are built from functions. </p>

<p>All modern programming languages have a notion of functions, procedures, subroutines or methods. They are an essential mechanism for code reuse.
Typically, we think of a function as something that operates on some input values to produce one or more output values. The input values can be globally declared, attributes of a class or passed as arguments to the function. Similarly, the output values can be returned directly, to global variables, as class attributes or by modifying the input values. </p>

<p>To benefit most from functional programming, it is best if functions are <em>pure</em>, which means that a call to the function always produces the same output for the same inputs. In practice, this is easier to achieve if the function only takes inputs as arguments and returns the output directly, but this is not essential.</p>

<p>The crucial feature of functional programming is that the input and output values of a function <em>can themselves be functions</em>. So functions must be values in your language. Sometimes this is called "functions must be first-class", and a function that takes and/or returns a function is sometimes called a "higher-order function". </p>

<p>If functions are values, it follows that we can assign them to variables. In particular we will assign them to the arguments of other functions. But we can also assign them to ordinary variables. </p>

<p>Let's consider the following function, <code>choose</code>, which takes three arguments <code>t</code>, <code>f</code> and <code>c</code>. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>choose</span> (\<span>t</span>, \<span>f</span>, \<span>d</span>) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>d</span>) {<span>t</span>} <span>else</span> {<span>f</span>}
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>choose</span> <span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>d</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>t</span> 
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>First let's call <code>choose</code> with strings as values for the first two arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>tstr</span> = <span>"True!"</span>;
<span>my</span> \<span>fstr</span> = <span>"False!"</span>;

<span>my</span> \<span>res_str</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tstr</span>, <span>fstr</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>res_str</span>; <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>tstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"True!"</span>
<span>fstr</span> <span>=</span> <span>"False!"</span>

<span>res_str</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tstr</span><span>,</span><span>fstr</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_str</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's try with functions as arguments:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>tt</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> }
<span>sub</span> <span>ff</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> }

<span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>&amp;tt</span>, <span>&amp;ff</span>, <span>False</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says &amp;ff</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"rumour"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>def</span> <span>tt</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>ff</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>  
  <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False"</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span>

<span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span><span>ff</span><span>,</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function tt at 0x7f829c3aa310&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"rumour"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "False rumour!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So our function <code>choose</code> took two functions as its first two arguments, and returned a function. In Raku we need the <code>&amp;</code> sigil on the function names because otherwise they would be evaluated: a bare function name like <code>tt</code> is the same as calling the function without arguments, <code>tt()</code>. By assigning this function to a variable (<code>res_f</code>), we can now call <code>res_f</code> as a function and it will eventually call <code>tt</code> or <code>ff</code> depending of the choice.</p>

<h2>Functions don't need a name</h2>

<p>Now, if we can assign functions to variables, they don't really need a name themselves. So our functions can be anonymous. Most languages support anonymous functions. In functional languages they are usually called <a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.github.io/articles/everything-is-a-function/">"lambda functions"</a>. In Raku, we have two ways to create anonymous functions:</p>

<p>Using the <code>sub (...)</code> syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>tt</span> = <span>sub</span> (\<span>s</span>) { <span>say</span> <span>"True {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or using the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/functions#index-entry-pointy_blocks">'pointy block' syntax</a>, which is a little bit more compact:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>ff</span> = -&gt; \<span>s</span> { <span>say</span> <span>"False {s}!"</span> };
</code></pre></div>
<p>Python uses the <code>lambda</code> keyword:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>tt</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"True "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>ff</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>s</span> <span>:</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>"False "</span><span>+</span><span>s</span><span>+</span><span>"!"</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So now we can say</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span> = <span>choose</span>(<span>tt</span>, <span>ff</span>, <span>True</span>);

<span>say</span> <span>&amp;res_f</span>; <span>#=&gt; says sub { }</span>
<span>res_f</span>(<span>"story"</span>); <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we print out the variable to which the function is bound, Raku returns <code>sub { }</code> to indicate that the variable contains a function.</p>

<p>In Python:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res_f</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span><span>(</span><span>tt</span><span>,</span> <span>ff</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span> <span>res_f</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says &lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f829b298b80&gt;</span>
<span>res_f</span><span>(</span><span>"story"</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; says "True story!"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Examples: <code>map</code>, <code>grep</code> and <code>reduce</code></h2>

<p>Functions of functions have many uses, and I just want to highlight three examples that are available readily in Raku: <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>grep</code>. Python has <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, and provides <code>reduce</code> via the <code>functools</code> module. What these functions have in common is that they offer an alternative to <code>for</code>-loops over lists.</p>

<h3><code>map</code> : applying a function to all elements of a list</h3>

<p><code>map</code> takes two arguments: a function and a list. It applies the function to all values in the list in order and returns the results, for example to square all values in a list:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>} , <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Python we need to explicitly create the tuple, but apart from the syntax differences, the structure is quite the same:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the functional alternative to the more conventional <code>for</code>-loop:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>10</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x*x</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>11</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that in both Raku and Python we need to use a mutable data structure for the <code>for</code>-loop version, whereas the <code>map</code> version uses immutable data structures.</p>

<h3><code>grep</code> : filtering a list</h3>

<p><code>grep</code> (called <code>filter</code> in Python) also takes arguments, a function and a list, but it only returns the values from the list for which the function returns <code>true</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = <span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can of course write this using a <code>for</code>-loop and an <code>if</code>-statement, but that again requires a mutable data structure:  </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>my</span> \<span>res</span> = [];
<span>for</span> <span>1</span> .. <span>30</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span>) {
    <span>res</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>x</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>):</span> 
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>):</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>What's nice about <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> is that you can easily chain them together:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="perl6"><span></span><span># Raku</span>
<span>grep</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> { <span>x</span> % <span>5</span> == <span>0</span> }, <span>map</span> -&gt; \<span>x</span> {<span>x*x</span>}, <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>30</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span># Python</span>
<span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>5</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>,</span><span>map</span><span>(</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span> <span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>,</span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>31</span><span>))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is because <code>map</code> and <code>grep</code> take a list and return a list, so as long as you need to operate on a list, you can do this by chaining the calls.</p>

<h3><code>reduce</code> : combining all elements of a list into a single value</h3>

<p><code>reduce</code> also takes a function and a list, but it uses the function to combine all elements of the list into a single result. So the function must take two arguments. The <em>second</em> argument is the element taken from the list, and the first argument is used as a state variable to combine all …</p></div></div>

"""

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos—states of dynamical systems whose apparently-random states of disorder and irregularities are often governed by deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:

"Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future."

Chaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the stock market and road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, physics, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, biology, ecology, pandemic crisis management, and philosophy. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.

<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the most talked-about topics in the tech landscape due to its potential for revolutionizing the world. Many thought leaders of the domain have spoken their minds on artificial intelligence at various occasions in different parts of the world. Today, we will list down the top&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;that have an in-depth meaning and are/were ahead of time.</p>



<p>Here is the list of&nbsp;top quotes about artificial intelligence: –</p>



<h3><strong>Quote On Artificial Intelligence By Stephen Hawking</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>“Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it. Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.”</p><cite>Stephen Hawking, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stephen Hawking’s&nbsp;quotes on artificial intelligence&nbsp;are very optimistic. Some of the famous quotes on artificial intelligence came from Hawking in 2014 when the BBC interviewed him. He said artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.</p>

<h3>Elon Musk On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>I have been banging this AI drum for a decade. We should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most wrong about AI are the ones who are very smart, because they can not imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That’s the flaw in their logic. They are just way dumber than they think they are.</p><cite>Elon Musk, 2020</cite></blockquote>



<p>Musk has been very vocal about artificial intelligence’s capabilities in changing the way we do our day-to-day tasks. Earlier, he had stressed on the fact that AI can be the cause for world war three. In his Tweet, Musk mentioned ‘it [war] begins’ while quoting a news, which noted Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, though on the ruler of the world; the president said the nation that leads in AI would be the ruler of the world.</p>

<h3>Mark Zuckerberg’s Quote</h3>



<p>Unlike negative quotes on artificial intelligence by others, Zuckerberg does not believe artificial intelligence will be a threat to the world. In his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10103911836230631/?t=1031">Facebook live</a>, Zuckerberg answered a user who asked about people like Elon Musk’s opinion about artificial intelligence. Here’s what he said:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic. I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic. And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios. I just don’t understand it. It’s really negative and in some ways, I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.”</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Larry Page’s Quote</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We’re nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”</p><cite>Larry Page</cite></blockquote>



<p>Stepped down as the CEO of Alphabet in late 2019, Larry Page has been passionate about integrating artificial intelligence in Google products. This was evident when the search giant announced that the firm is moving from ‘Mobile-first’ to ‘AI-first’.</p>



<h3>Sebastian Thrun’s Quote On Artificial Intelligence</h3>



<blockquote><p>“Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It’s really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Sebastian Thrun</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sebastian Thrun is the co-founder of Udacity and earlier established Google X — the team behind Google self-driving car and Google Glass. He is one of the pioneers of the self-driving technology; Thrun, along with his team, won the Pentagon’s 2005 contest for self-driving vehicles, which was a massive leap in the autonomous vehicle landscape.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tesla.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a>, the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, accused and filled a suit against its electric vehicle automaker rivals —&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://rivian.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivian</a>.</p>



<p>According to Tesla, Rivian is stimulating employees of Tesla to leave their job and encouraging them to pouch the company’s trade secrets, confidential, and property information while leaving the firm.</p>



<p>Tesla also indicted Rivian by alleging that the rival startup has already recruited four of its employees who stole highly sensitive information while leaving. The largest automaker mentioned in the new suit that a total of 178 former Tesla employees are working at Rivian. And of which around 70 of them directly joined the rival startup.</p>

<p>While Tesla is blaming its rival, Rivian defended itself with a statement to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tesla-takes-aim-at-rivian-in-lawsuit-alleging-trade-secret-theft-poaching-talent/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Crunch</a>: “We admire Tesla for its leadership in resetting expectations of what an electric car can be. Rivian is made up of high-performing, mission-driven teams, and our business model and technology are based on many years of engineering, design and strategy development. This requires the contribution and know-how of thousands of employees from across the technology and automotive spaces. Upon joining Rivian, we require all employees to confirm that they have not, and will not, introduce former employers’ intellectual property into Rivian systems. This suit’s allegations are baseless and run counter to Rivian’s culture, ethos and corporate policies.”</p>



<p>With investments from Amazon and Ford, Rivian is a significant player in the electric vehicle industry and had bagged high-profile deals from Amazon. The largest e-commerce company has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian, which are yet to be delivered by the Tesla rival. R.J Scaringe founded Rivian in the year 2009, and today the company has footprints in many countries such as Canada, California, Plymouth, Normal, San Jose, United Kingdom, and more.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Tesla alleged that its employees steal sensitive information and leave the company and joined rivals organizations such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xpeng Motors</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://zoox.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoox Inc</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It must have been about a year ago, just after I moved from San Francisco here to New York. I was having steaks with my good friend and soon to be business partner, Kyle. Kyle and I transferred to Vanderbilt at the same time, were placed a few doors down from each other in an awful, mold-ridden dorm which we would both soon move out of (and which was knocked down by the time we graduated), and spent our first night on campus drinking whiskey together with another future friend of ours. Over the next few years, Kyle and I hung out a lot, studied together often and discussed a lot of business and investing ideas while procrastinating from said studies. This past year, a few months after the aforementioned dinner, we bought in 50/50 on a real estate investment, a multi-family duplex in his hometown of Lexington, Kentucky. I never imagined that I would become a Kentucky homeowner, but because of Kyle, now I am. Our investment is going very well so far and I am confident that Kyle and I will be doing a lot more together in the future, real estate or otherwise.</p>



<p>Going back to that dinner, over my ribeye and glass of wine and his filet and Coca-Cola, Kyle and I discussed where each of us were and where we wanted to be headed, in terms of our careers mostly as the majority time consumers of our lives in general. I was working as many hours as ever in investment banking and he had recently moved on from banking and into equity research. In discussing his decision to make the transition, he made a somewhat obvious point that I think tends to get overlooked and underestimated nonetheless, which is why I am choosing to write about it today. That is, he pointed out that we should be thinking about the value of our time in terms of hours rather than years.</p>



<p>Most career-oriented jobs advertise salary to their prospective applicants. I used to think of my income in investment banking as a combination of salary and bonus because the latter comprises an unusually large percentage of most people’s overall annual income in the industry (i.e. the end of year bonuses are often more or less equal to annual salaries for top performers).</p>



<p>After Kyle’s comment, I started to think about income more often in terms of dollars per hour. Think about the following hypothetical. All other things equal, would you rather work 80 hours per week for $100,000 or 40 hours per week for $75,000? The former pays $24 / hour and the latter pays $36 / hour. Most logical people would opt for the latter as the difference in the hourly rate is just too great. The decision would be more difficult however if the 40 hours per week job only paid $60,000. In that case, the income per hour of the 40 hours per week job ($29) would still be greater than that of the 80 hours per week job ($24), but the larger difference in annual salary becomes a bit more difficult of a pill to swallow ($100,000 – $60,000 = $40,000). I am not advocating for choosing one job over the other, even in this idealistic situation where everything else was somehow exactly equal, which of course in real life it would never be. I am simply advocating for people to more deliberately consider the time they expect to give in exchange for a salary when considering an offer.</p>



<p>Further on the hypothetical situation above, even if you were to take the 40 hour per week job at a salary of $75,000 and you are one of the increasingly popular breed of millennials who wants to work 80 hours per week still, that is totally fine. You can spend your time working on things that you are interested in and passionate about, invest your time in learning new skills and/or subjects, or if short-term income is your primary focus, get another part-time job or create your own side hustle for evenings and/or weekends. If you make more than $12 / hour for 40 additional hours of work, you would make more annually than the 80 hour per week job that paid $100,000.&nbsp; For comparison’s sake, the much debated minimum wage for food service workers in New York City is $15 / hour…</p>



<p>Moreover, as with most other things, when it comes to your free time, or disposable time as I prefer to call it, scarcity increases value. The less disposable time you have, the more precious it becomes, the more valuable it becomes. Think about it in extremes. If you had no disposable time (free time to do with what you wish), you would not be able to sleep at your own discretion (this is unfortunately a reality for some people who work long hour jobs or multiple jobs including night shifts). As such, most people would demand more money in exchange for working their 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hour of the day than the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup>. They probably have at least six hours set aside to work anyway and will take what they can get in terms of income in exchange for that time. The 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, and 18<sup>th</sup> hours on the other hand cut into the human necessity of sleep and for that reason they are very valuable. The same goes for the less extreme hours in between. There must be a gradual increase in the value of every hour between those two ranges of hours. The less disposable time you have, the more important are the things you have to cut for work such as time for meals with family or friends, time to go to the gym, time to read a book or watch TV, and time to just relax or enjoy your weekends.</p>



<p>Of course, this point about considering income per hour rather than annual salary cannot be considered in a vacuum because there are a host of other related factors that are also important in making decisions around what to do for money. For example, if the day to day composition of your work includes a number of tasks, practices and activities that you like or even love doing or that you might be doing anyway if you had the freedom to choose what to do with your time, then you should be willing to accept less income in exchange for your time because there is less of a difference in the enjoyment or utility of what you have to do for that income versus what you might otherwise be doing.</p>



<p>Once in a while you hear people who love their jobs say things like “I feel like I have never worked a day in my life” or “If money was not a thing, I would be doing exactly the same work that I am doing now”. Those people are mostly outliers and exceptions for now, but the optimist in me convinces the pragmatist that one day in the not too distant future it will become much more common as more menial tasks become automated and some form(s) of universal basic income increasingly provides people with more disposable income/time to live their lives as they please. In the meantime, most of us will continue to feel that we have to make some sort of trade off involving time for money. I suggest that we think about that trade-off in terms of hours as opposed to years. Forget salary.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

Apple in a support bulletin said that using tapes/physical covers could eventually degrade the webcam and damage the MacBook display. The Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148">advisory</a> says that MacBook users should just rely on the indicator light that shows when the camera is active.</p><p>Apple explains that using a webcam cover, such as a small piece of tape, could actually break down features like the ambient light sensor or True Tone. Apple may have its reasons to warn MacBook users, but Librem Linux smartphones and laptop makers don’t like Apple’s advice. In a <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/apple-has-no-tolerance-for-webcam-covers/">blog post</a>, Purism Chief Security Officer, Kyle Rankin says Apple’s advice is ‘discouraging’ from a security point of view. Rankin says that Apple wants its users to follow the “just trust us” policy which is very unsound cybersecurity advice to give.</p><p>“While this advice is consistent with Apple’s overall “just trust us” approach to security, it completely misses the point of why people used webcam covers to begin with: to claw back the tiniest bit of control over their privacy from hardware and software companies,” Rankin says in the post.</p><p>Rankin is very critical of this sort of cybersecurity approach and says that Apple is doing more harm than good by telling MacBook users to rely on it for cybersecurity. Rankin says that if MacBook owners follow Apple’s advisory, they will lose control over their security.</p><p>“The fundamental flaw with Apple’s approach is that it takes all control over security and privacy away from you. To be secure you must fully trust Apple and their security measures and if anything ever happens to violate that trust, such as a security exploit, there isn’t much you can do about it,” Rankin adds.</p><p>Rankin says that Purism believes in totally opposite concept for providing security to users. While Purism offers users <strong>Kill Switches</strong> to kill their microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc. and be in control, Apple wants to be the sole security custodian for such services. “Apple and Purism take completely different approaches to security. Apple’s approach is to require customers to hand over all trust and control to Apple and depend upon Apple for all of their security. Purism’s approach is to give customers control over their own computers and provide security without depending upon Purism. Webcam security is a great lens through which to view these completely opposite approaches,” Rankin adds, “In the end, your privacy and your computer should belong to you, not the vendor that sold it.”</p><p>Purism is a Linux hardware maker and sells Linux smartphones, tablets, and laptops under the Librem brand. All Librem devices are designed to protect privacy and freedom by avoiding the Intel Active Management Technology. All Librem laptops feature hardware kill switches for the microphone, webcam, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>Python web scraping is a field where you can collect data from online web pages. For many different purposes. Mostly for data mining for data analysis, data science and machine learning. However there are so many use cases for web scraping. </p>



<p>Web scraping is a bit of a dark art in the sense, that with great power comes great responsibility. Use what you learn in this tutorial only to do ethical scraping. In this python web scraping tutorial, we will scrape the worldometer website for some data on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Then do something with that data. Since this is a web scraping tutorial we will mainly be focusing on the scraping portion and only very little be touching on the data processing side of the tutorial.</p>



<p>We will be using a python library called <strong>beautifulsoup </strong>for our web scraping project. It is important to note that beautiful soup isn’t the silver bullet in web scraping. </p>



<p>It mainly is a wrapper for a parse which makes it more intuitive and simpler to extract data from markup like HTML and XML. If you are looking for something which can help you navigate pages. </p>



<p>Also be able to crawl websites then beautiful soup won’t do that on it’s own. However it is good to note that there are other options such as <strong>python scrapy</strong> as well. There will later on be a tutorial on scrapy as well. </p>



<p>Then you can actually decide which is the best for your particular project or use case. Before we can get started let us start by installing beautifulsoup. So for this we will need to create a virtual environment. </p>



<p>If you are using windows, mac, Linux the procedure should be very similar. So here we go:</p>



<h2>Python beautifulsoup: installation</h2>



<p>Let us create a virtual environment for our project. So if you are on windows open a powershell or cmd prompt. If on mac or linux open up a terminal and execute the following commands.</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">python -m virtualenv bsenv</code></pre>



<p>Where bsenv will be the folder where our virtual environment will be. You can now run:</p>



<p>Windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">.\bsenv\Scripts\activate</code></pre>



<p>Linux/Mac:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">source bsenv/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p>This should now activate your virtual environment like this and we can now install beautifulsoup.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation virtualenv" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-39.png"></figure>



<p>Run this to install on linux/mac/windows:</p>



<pre><code lang="powershell">pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests</code></pre>



<p>To test that beautifulsoup is installed. Run a python terminal and import beautifulsoup like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png" alt="python web scraping beautifulsoup installation" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-40.png"></figure>



<p>If that worked for you then great you are installed! Let us now start with the most basic example. </p>



<h2>Beautifulsoup: HTML page python web scraping / parsing</h2>



<p>So here is an HTML example we will work with to just start with. So go ahead and paste this into your favorite editor and save it as <strong>index.html</strong>.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Joe&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Suzanne&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Jane&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;John&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;69&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
       
    &lt;/table&gt;
    
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Once you have saved that. Create a new python script called: scrape.py.  Here is the code we going to use to get some info from our index.html file.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

print(soup.title.text)</code></pre>



<p>This very basic bit of code will grab the title tag text from our index.html document. This is how the output will look if you run it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-41.png"></figure>



<p>Let’s now try do something a little more complicated like grabbing all the tr tags. Then displaying all the names in the tags.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
data = open("index.html").read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')

trs = soup.find_all('tr')

for tr in trs:
    td = tr.findChildren("td")
    
    if not td: 
        continue
    print(td[0].text)</code></pre>



<p>Your output should look something like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-42.png"></figure>



<p>To explain how this code works. We are loading up the html with a basic file read in python. We then instantiate the BeautifulSoup parser with our html data. We then do a find_all on all the tr tags.</p>



<p>I then loop over all the trs and find all the td children. If the td children don’t exist we skip over this item. Then finally we just get the first element and print the text contained in those tags.</p>



<p>So, so far so good pretty simple right. Let’s now look at getting some data using a request. The url we will be using to get some data is: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: From a web page url</h2>



<p>To be able to load up the html from the web page we will use the requests library in python and then feed that data to beautiful soup. Here is the code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = requests.get('https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
data_table = soup.find('table', id='main_table_countries_today')
rows = data_table.find_all('tr')
datalist = []
for row in rows:
    rowlist = []
    
    try:
        tds = row.find_all('td')
        for td in tds:
            rowlist.append(td.text)
        datalist.append(','.join(rowlist))
    except:
        pass
print('\n'.join(datalist))</code></pre>



<p>So if you run this it will output a csv set of data for us will be generated like this which we can use for some data analysis or maybe even some type of other data source. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png" alt="beautiful soup requests data" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-43.png"></figure>



<p>Here is how the code works. So first thing is we import requests, so that we can make web requests using our python script. We then call requests.get to get the url and at the end choose to get the text version of the data. </p>



<p>So that we get the raw html data. Next we add this to our BeautifulSoup object and use the html.parser. Then we select a table with the id=main_table_countries_today. </p>



<p>How we find this is you will open the page in your chrome or firefox browser head over to the table, then right click and select the inspect option. </p>



<p>If you have done this you should be able to find this id main_table_countries_today. So once we have that we will use data_table variable we just created. Which will now contain the data table element. </p>



<p>Then we simply do a find all to find all the tr elements in that table. Next we loop over all our rows and just initialize an empty rowlist to store our data in. After that we open a try except block, so that if any of the elements are missing in our data we won’t error out our script. </p>



<p>The try except will basically skip over the critical errors so our script can continue reading the html. In the try except we do a find all for all the td tags, then finally loop over them to add the columns to our rowlist.</p>



<p> Outside of that loop we join them on a comma. Then outside of that loop we add the row to our datalist and then finally outside of that loop we join our datalist rows to create a csv like print out of the data.</p>



<p>If you look at the code, that was pretty simple to just gather some basic table form data. Scraping like this needs to really be done carefully as you don’t want to overwhelm anyone’s server. </p>



<p>So once again this is only for educational purposes and what you do with this is at your own risk. However for basic scraping on your own websites which you own you can collect data etc.</p>



<p>If you are wanting to learn web scraping it is best to do as much of it offline, so you can rapidly test and don’t have to do a request to a server the whole time. </p>



<p>For that you can just save a particular web page using your browser and work on that html file locally.</p>



<p>Let us look at another example of some web scraping before we end off this tutorial.</p>



<h2>Python web scraping: creating a blog post feed</h2>



<p>So you may want to create a blog post feed. For whatever reason, maybe you are building an application. </p>



<p>Which needs to retrieve basic data from a blog post for a social sharing website. Then you can use beautifulsoup to parse some of this data.</p>



<p>To show you how this can work let us scrape some data from my own blog from the home page.</p>



<p>So we will use the url: https://generalistprogrammer.com</p>



<p>So for this I have saved the html page using my browser like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-44.png"></figure>



<p>I suggest if you want to follow along you should do the same. Please don’t do a request to my server in python. So save that as <strong>gp.html</strong>.</p>



<p>Now here is a pro tip. You might get this really strange error with this code.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.8_3.8.1520.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\lib\encodings\cp1252.py”, line 23, in decode<br>return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]<br>UnicodeDecodeError: ‘charmap’ codec can’t decode byte 0x8d in position 18403: character maps to</p>



<p>If you are getting this error, it is because our reader is not reading this as utf8. So to fix this we modify our code to look like this.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
data = open('gp.html',encoding='utf8').read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(data,'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())</code></pre>



<p>So we basically just added encoding=’utf8′. Then when you run it you will get the output of the web page.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-45.png"></figure>



<p>So great you may have noticed I used the .prettify at the end that just makes this html more structured and easier to read using beautifulsoup. So let’s now follow the same procedure as before by using our inspector tool in chrome / firefox like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-46.png"></figure>



<p>That will open up the inspector tool like this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-47.png"></figure>



<p>So this helps us find the entry point for our scraper. So we want to look at all articles. Then you will notice the article tag slightly above this tag. So let’s start …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this blog post, we look at three approaches for eliminating duplicate objects from Arrays.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="eliminating-duplicates-from-arrays">Eliminating duplicates from Arrays&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Eliminating duplicate values from Arrays is simple – as long as the values are primitive (and therefore compared by value):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> values = [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>, <span>'jane'</span>];
<span>const</span> uniqueValues = [...new <span>Set</span>(values)];
assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueValues,
  [<span>'jane'</span>, <span>'lars'</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>However, that approach doesn’t work with the following data because a Set would consider each object to be unique:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> members = [
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
  },
  {
    <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
    <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
  },
];
</code></pre>
<h2 id="approach-1%3A-building-a-new-array-without-duplicates">Approach 1: building a new Array without duplicates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code><span>const</span> uniqueMembers1 = [];

<span>for</span> (<span>const</span> m <span>of</span> members) {
  <span>if</span> (!containsMember(uniqueMembers1, m)) {
    uniqueMembers1.push(m);
  }
}

<span><span>function</span> <span>containsMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.find(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers1,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>We only add an object from <code>members</code> to <code>uniqueMembers1</code> if it doesn’t already exist in that Array. That’s why the earlier Jane with ID <code>'10yejma'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-2%3A-using-.filter()">Approach 2: using <code>.filter()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers2 = members.filter(
  <span>(<span>m, index, ms</span>) =&gt;</span> getIndexOfMember(ms, m) === index);

<span><span>function</span> <span>getIndexOfMember</span>(<span>memberArray, member</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> memberArray.findIndex(
    <span>(<span>m</span>) =&gt;</span> m.first === member.first &amp;&amp; m.last === member.last);
}

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers2,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'10yejma'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p><code>getIndexOfMember()</code> returns the first index where a member appears. We tell <code>.filter()</code> to only keep the members at those indices. That’s why the first Jane “wins”.</p>
<h2 id="approach-3%3A-a-map-from-unique-keys-to-members">Approach 3: a Map from unique keys to members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> uniqueKeyToMember = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(
  members.map(<span><span>m</span> =&gt;</span> [m.first+<span>'\t'</span>+m.last, m])); 
<span>const</span> uniqueMembers3 = [...uniqueKeyToMember.values()];

assert.deepEqual(
  uniqueMembers3,
  [
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Jane'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1y15hhu'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Bond'</span>,
    },
    {
      <span>first</span>: <span>'Lars'</span>,
      <span>id</span>: <span>'1hhs0k2'</span>,
      <span>last</span>: <span>'Croft'</span>,
    },
  ]);
</code></pre>
<p>If an object that is added to the Map has the same unique key as a previous object, it replaces that object. That’s why the later Jane with ID <code>'1y15hhu'</code> “wins”.</p>
<h3 id="variants-of-approach-1-and-approach-2">Variants of approach 1 and approach 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We use a Set to record unique keys of members that we have visited. If the key of the current member is already in that Set, then we don’t push it (approach 1) or filter it out (approach 2).</p>
<p>This may help with large Arrays because we don’t have to search them. On the other hand, creating keys and maintaining a Set affects performance negatively.</p>

                                                        <p><strong>EU supports joint strategy for innovation in research and teaching with a total of five million euros</strong></p>

<p>The university network ENLIGHT is to become a European University. The EU will fund the network of nine research-intensive universities, among them the University of Göttingen, with five million euro for a three-year period. In the coming semester, the partners will begin implementing a joint strategy for innovation in research and higher education. ENLIGHT stands for <em>European university Network to promote equitable quality of Life, sustainability and Global engagement through Higher education Transformation</em>. The EU’s main aim behind the pilot call “European Universities” was to transform the European Higher Education sector. Twenty-four university networks were selected in the second round of this initiative.</p>

<p>“The goals we set ourselves within this consortium are highly ambitious, but I am convinced that this is the right way forward,” says Professor Reinhard Jahn, President of the University of Göttingen. “Even after years of European integration there are still obstacles to collaborative research and the Europeanisation of higher education. In order to tear down these remaining barriers, we need consortiums wherein we trust each other and can dare to experiment. I am proud that Göttingen is among the universities that will shape this reform process in Europe and look forward to tackling this challenge.”</p>

<p>In joint structures and through innovative teaching opportunities, the nine ENLIGHT universities will empower students with the right knowledge and skills to become engaged citizens and professionals and respond to the major, complex societal challenges of the 21st century.</p>

<p>“ENLIGHT is unique in its geographical, economic, social, cultural and linguistic diversity,” says Professor Hiltraud Casper-Hehne, Vice-President for Internationalisation at the University of Göttingen. “The dedicated and sustainable commitment to this goal has been worth it! We will now use this breadth and wealth to create new, flexible and international research and study opportunities tailored to everyone's individual needs. In so doing, we will lay the foundation for the next generation of genuine Europeans.”</p>

<p>"This is a great success for the University of Göttingen and its international partners," explains Björn Thümler, Minister for Science and Culture of Lower Saxony. "This award means that Lower Saxony is clearly placed on the map of European science. This is whole-hearted confirmation of our course to strongly focus on European initiatives. The support of the University of Göttingen in the application process has paid off.”</p>

<p>ENLIGHT unites the universities of the Basque Country, Bordeaux, Galway, Gent, Göttingen, Groningen, Tartu, Uppsala and Comenius University in Bratislava. Cross-border collaboration is as central to the joint strategy as a focus on the locality, where the partners intend to address societal challenges in a local context. ENLIGHT will pilot new learning formats across five focus themes: Climate Change, Health and Well-Being, Inequalities, Digital Revolution, Energy and Circularity. In these areas, students will engage with researchers, citizens and professionals from their communities. They will discuss problems and solutions, examine innovation potential and promote diversity. The exchange within the network will allow European solutions to emerge from these local contexts, and in this process, students will also be involved. This constitutes a completely new form of university education.</p>

<p>The ENLIGHT project was established in close collaboration with the student representatives of all ENLIGHT universities. The Student Network will continue to play a central role to meet the needs of current and future student generations.</p>

<p>ENLIGHT's ambition extends much further than the three-year project lifespan. In the long-term, ENLIGHT wants to create an open accessible space without barriers between the nine universities for researching, learning, teaching and working together. ENLIGHT intends to develop a model that not only applies within Europe, but also has a true impact worldwide and makes a substantial contribution to strengthen Europe's role in the world.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is going to outline the procedure for setting up a Haskell development environment.</p>

<p>This post differs from most posts around setting up a Haskell development environment in the sense that it does not directly jump into Cabal or Stack. Instead, it first provides some background information that makes it possible to understand the basics of the development environment in Haskell, the different moving parts, and how those come together in turning Haskell source code into an executable which can then be run.</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<p>A separate post will build on the information provided here and show how to make use of Stack or Cabal.</p>



<p>Haskell programs are compiled native executable binaries. Haskell programs are compiled. Software is written in Haskell, which by the way is a high-level programming language that is first converted into machine language which then gets executed. In this sense Haskell is different from languages like JavaScript and Python, which are interpreted language, but similar to languages like Java and Go, which are also compiled. It should be noted that it is also possible to run Haskell programs like an interpreted language. We get to this pretty soon, but most of the time, Haskell programs are compiled.</p>

<p>The Haskell compilation process produces native executive binaries. The keyword here is native. This means once a Haskell program is compiled, it does not need anything else to be able to run. This is similar to languages like Rust and Go, which also produce native executive binaries, but differ from languages like Java and C#, which requires a runtime to be first installed on the target computer before the compiled program can be executed.</p>

<p>The job of converting software written in a high-level programming language to machine language is done by a compiler. In the case of Haskell, the compiler is known as <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler)</a>. Sometimes GHC is referred to as The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler or Glorious Haskell Compiler. GHC is not the only Haskell compiler in existence; others exist. Some other ones are <a href="https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc">UHC (Utrecht Haskell Compiler)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Lemmih/lhc">LHC (LLVM Haskell Compiler)</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Hugs">HUGS (Haskell User´s Gofer System)</a>. Even though other compilers exist, GHC has evolved to be the one true Haskell compiler, as it is by far the most used Haskell compiler. The other compilers are not as used or they are no longer supported. Haskell Wiki <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Implementations">lists</a> all the other compilers for Haskell.</p>

<p>To setup, a Haskell development environment is then essentially setting up GHC, and be able to use it to compile Haskell source code to executable binaries.</p>



<p>The method for getting GHC installed varies depending on the operating system and the installation methods. This post will only focus on the installation on macOS and Linux (Ubuntu).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are already familiar with Haskell, this is the point where you probably expect Cabal or Stack to be introduced. But on the contrary, Cabal/Stack won’t be mentioned yet. The idea is to install GHC without these tools in other to get a feeling of how things work behind the scenes. Doing this will also help appreciate the motivation for tools like Cabal and Stack exist within Haskell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For installation on macOS <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/"><code>ghcup</code></a> will be used while installation will be done using the Software repository on Ubuntu (Linux).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ghcup">What is ghcup</h2>

<p><code>ghcup</code> describes itself as the Haskell (GHC) toolchain installer. Similar in scope to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup">rustup</a> with Rust. It provides the mechanism to install all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. Together these components are sometimes referred to as the Haskell toolchain, of which GHC is a constituent.</p>



<p>Haskell toolchain is often used to refer to all the necessary components required for developing Haskell. It comprises of the compiler together with other auxiliary tools. As at the writing of this post, here is a list of what makes up the toolchain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GHC: The Haskell batch compiler. This is used for compiler source files into either libraries and executables.  Libraries are used as dependencies in other Haskell projects while executable are binaries that are run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GHCi: An interactive Haskell interpreter, which allows making use of GHC in an interactive environment. GHCi is what powers the Haskell REPL</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runghc: A shell script that allows running Haskell as a script. Find more information on how to use <code>runghc</code> <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/runghc.html">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runhaskell: Similar to <code>runghc</code> but allows the ability to swap the Haskell compiler from <code>ghc</code> to something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Haddock: a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code. See <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">here</a> for more information about Haddock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hp2ps: a profile tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html">here</a> for more on how to use the Haskell profiler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hpc: a code coverage tool for Haskell programs. See <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_program_coverage">here</a> for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will like to note that the official download page is quite confusing. It refers to a Haskell platform which in reality no longer exists. It also presents 3 different classes of Haskell installation: Minimal Installation/Stack/Haskell Platform which is also really not the best representation of the process of installing Haskell. It is best to view installing Haskell as the process of getting the Haskell toolchain. This can be done by building from source, using a tool like <code>ghcup</code> or <code>Cabal</code> or <code>Stack</code>. The confusing state of the Download page is known, as can be seen from these two issues that have been created to resolve the problem: <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/issues/12">Download page is confusing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/haskell-infra/www.haskell.org/pull/14">Download Page: Rearrangement of sections</a>. As of the writing of this post, these issues have not been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we know what the Haskell toolchain comprises of, let us look at some of the ways of getting it installed. First, we start by looking at how to install it on a Mac using <code>ghcup</code>.</p>



<p>There are a couple of ways to install <code>ghcup</code> but the most straightforward approach is to follow the instructions found at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/</a>.</p>

<p>The installation process involves executing a command in the terminal and then following the prompts.</p>

<p>After installation is done, you will see a final prompt that may look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Installation is done!

To run `ghc` and cabal, you need to adjust your PATH variable.
You may want to source '/Users/schooloffp/.ghcup/env' in your shell
configuration to do so (e.g. ~/.bashrc).

Detected bash shell on your system...
If you want ghcup to automatically add the required PATH variable to "/Users/schooloffp/.bashrc"
answer with YES, otherwise with NO and press ENTER.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is about making the related binaries <code>ghcup</code> installed available in the terminal, so it is a good idea to type YES and have the <code>.bashrc</code> modified.</p>

<p>Note that on macOS, the <code>.bashrc</code> file is not run automatically. See this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13019">stackoverflow answer</a>. This means the above process of <code>ghcup</code> modifying the <code>.bashrc</code> will not suffice to get the needed binary available in the terminal. There are a couple of ways to remedy this. One way, as also noted in the StackOverflow thread is to add <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> to the <code>~/.profile</code>.</p>

<p>Once this is done, you can then execute the installed binaries from the terminal. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

ghci --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.8.4

haddock --version
Haddock version 2.23.0, (c) Simon Marlow 2006
Ported to use the GHC API by David Waern 2006-2008

</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>An inquisitive reader would have also found that apart from the binaries listed as a constituent of the Haskell Toolchain, a cabal binary has also been installed as part of the <code>ghcup</code> installation process. This is indeed the case. <code>ghcup</code> also installs cabal, but we will ignore cabal for now and talk about it in subsequent posts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It should be noted that the above method of using <code>ghcup</code> to install the Haskell toolchain will also work on a Linux machine. The main objective of the installation process is to get necessary binaries unto the system, and most Linux distribution has a procedure for this already using their software package management. Hence it is also possible to use those to install the Haskell toolchain.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that most of the time, the Haskell version found in the official software repositories of most Linux distribution would be out of date.</p>

<p>At least that is the case with Ubuntu. Running the command below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> apt-cache policy haskell-platform
haskell-platform:
Installed: (none)
Candidate: 2014.2.0.0.debian4
Version table:
2014.2.0.0.debian4 500
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe amd64 Packages
500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe i386 Packages
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shows that the Debian package version found for Haskell is 2014.2.0.0.debian4. And if we find this on <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/haskell-platform/2014.2.0.0.debian4">Launchpad</a> we see this was uploaded 2016.</p>

<p>On installation by running <code>sudo apt-get install haskell-platform</code>, we can then check the version of <code>ghc</code> that is installed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.0.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This shows version 8.0.2. Even though, at the time of writing this post, the most recent version is 8.8.4</p>

<p>Therefore to get the latest Haskell Toolchain installed on Ubuntu, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~hvr/+archive/ubuntu/ghc">hpv’s PPA</a> can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some background information about what PPA (Personal Package Archive) is, see <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA">Packaging/PPA</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adding the PPA:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hvr/ghc
sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installing Haskell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// sudo apt-get install ghc-x.y.z where x.y.z is the version to install

sudo apt-get install ghc-8.8.3
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the moment of writing this, even though 8.8.4 is the recent version, the latest version available via install via the PPA is version 8.8.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The installation processes put the binaries in <code>/opt/ghc</code></p>



<p>Hence to have the binary available in the terminal, updating the path is one approach:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ghc/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After which the installation can …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re learning a new tool, you should first ask yourself two questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does this tool exist?</li>
<li>What problems does this tool solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can’t answer both of those questions, you may not need the tool in the first place. Let’s take those questions and apply them to webpack.</p>
<h3>Why does Webpack exist?</h3>
<p>At its core, webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the <a href="https://ui.dev/javascript-modules-iifes-commonjs-esmodules/">modules</a> in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your <code>index.html</code> file can reference.</p>
<div data-language="md"><pre><code>App.js ---&gt;     |         |
Dashboard.js -&gt; | Bundler | -&gt; bundle.js
About.js ---&gt;   |         |</code></pre></div>
<h3>What problem is webpack solving?</h3>
<p>Historically when building a JavaScript application, your JavaScript code would be separated by files (these files may or may not have been actual modules). Then in your <code>index.html</code> file, you’d have to include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to every JavaScript file you had.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not only was this tedious, but it was also error-prone. There were the obvious issues like typos or forgetting to include a file, but more than that, the order of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags mattered. If you loaded a script that depended on React before loading the React script, things would break. Because webpack (intelligently) creates a bundle for you, both of those problems go away. You don’t have to worry about forgetting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and you don’t have to worry about the order.</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  ...

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>'</span>dist/bundle.js<span>'</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we’ll soon see, the “module bundling” aspect is just one part of webpack. If needed, you’re also able to tell webpack to make certain transformations on your modules before adding them to the bundle. Examples might include transforming SASS/LESS to regular CSS or “modern JavaScript” to ES5 that the browser can understand.</p>
<h3>Installing webpack</h3>
<p>Assuming you’ve initialized a new project with npm, there are two packages you need to install to use webpack, <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> webpack webpack-cli --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<h3>webpack.config.js</h3>
<p>Once you’ve installed <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>, it’s time to start configuring webpack. To do that, you’ll create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file that exports an object. Naturally, this object is where all the configuration settings for webpack will go.</p>

<p>Remember, the whole point of webpack is to “examine all of your modules, (optionally) transform them, then intelligently put all of them together into one or more bundle(s)” If you think about that process, in order to do that, webpack needs to know three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry point of your application</li>
<li>Which transformations, if any, to make on your code</li>
<li>The location to put the newly formed bundle(s)</li>
</ol>
<h4>The entry point</h4>
<p>Whenever your application is composed of modules, there’s always a single module that is the entry point of your application. It’s the module that kicks everything off. Typically, it’s an <code>index.js</code> file. Something like this.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>index<span>.</span>js
  imports about<span>.</span>js
  imports dashboard<span>.</span>js
    imports graph<span>.</span>js
    imports auth<span>.</span>js
      imports api<span>.</span>js</code></pre></div>
<p>If we give webpack the path to this entry file, it’ll use that to create the dependency graph of our application (much like we did above, except… better). To do that, you add an <code>entry</code> property to your webpack config which points to your entry file.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Transformations with Loaders</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file, the next thing we need to tell it is what transformations to run on our code. To do this, we’ll use what are called “loaders”.</p>
<p>Out of the box, when webpack is building its dependency graph by examining all of your <code>import</code>/<code>require()</code> statements, it’s only able to process JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> auth <span>from</span> <span>'./api/auth'</span> 
<span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./utils/config.json'</span> 
<span>import</span> <span>'./styles.css'</span> 
<span>import</span> logo <span>from</span> <span>'./assets/logo.svg'</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>There’s a very good chance that you’re going to want your dependency tree to be made up of more than just JS and JSON files - i.e., you’re going to want to be able to import <code>.css</code> files, <code>.svg</code> files, images, etc, as we’re doing above. This is where “loaders” can help us out. The primary purpose of a loader, as the name suggests, is to give webpack the ability to process more than just JavaScript and JSON files.</p>
<p>The first step to adding any loader is to download it. Because we want to add the ability to <code>import</code> <code>.svg</code> files in our app, we’ll download the <code>svg-inline-loader</code> from npm.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> svg-inline-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add it to our webpack config. All of the information for your loaders will go into an array of objects under <code>module.rules</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now there are two pieces of information we need to give webpack about each loader. First, the type of file we want to run the loader on (in our case, all <code>.svg</code> files). Second, the loader to use on that file type (in our case, <code>svg-inline-loader</code>).</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll have an object with two properties, <code>test</code> and <code>use</code>. <code>test</code> will be a regex to match the file path and <code>use</code> will be the name of the loader we want to use.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we’ll be able to import <code>.svg</code> files. What about our <code>.css</code> files though? Let’s add a loader for that as well. We’ll use the <code>css-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> css-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now anywhere in our app, we can import <code>.svg</code> and <code>.css</code> files. However, there’s still one more loader we need to add to get our styles to work properly. Right now, because of our <code>css-loader</code>, we’re able to <code>import</code> <code>.css</code> files. However, that doesn’t mean those styles are being injected into the DOM. What we really want to do is <code>import</code> a CSS file then have webpack put all of that CSS in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM so they’re active on the page. To do that, we’ll use the <code>style-loader</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> style-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice, because we now have two loaders for our <code>.css</code> rule, we change <code>use</code> to be an array. Also, notice that we have <code>style-loader</code> before <code>css-loader</code>. This is important. Webpack will process those in reverse order. So <code>css-loader</code> will interpret the <code>import './styles.css'</code> line then <code>style-loader</code> will inject that CSS into the DOM.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we just saw with <code>style-loader</code>, loaders can do more than just allow you to <code>import</code> certain file types. They’re also able to run transformations on files before they get added to the final output bundle. The most popular is transforming “next generation JavaScript” to the JavaScript of today that browsers can understand using <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow">Babel</a>. To do this, you can use the <code>babel-loader</code> on every <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> babel-loader --save-dev</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>There are loaders for just about anything you’d need to do. You can check out the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/" rel="nofollow">full list here</a>.</p>
<h4>The output</h4>
<p>Now that webpack knows the entry file and what loaders to use, the next thing we need to tell it is where to put the bundle it creates. To do this, you add an <code>output</code> property to your webpack config.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> path <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'path'</span><span>)</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  entry<span>:</span> <span>'./app/index.js'</span><span>,</span>
  module<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    rules<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.svg$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'svg-inline-loader'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.css$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>'style-loader'</span><span>,</span> <span>'css-loader'</span> <span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span> test<span>:</span> <span>/\.(js)$/</span><span>,</span> use<span>:</span> <span>'babel-loader'</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  output<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    path<span>:</span> path<span>.</span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span>__dirname<span>,</span> <span>'dist'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    filename<span>:</span> <span>'index_bundle.js'</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So the full process looks something like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>webpack grabs the entry point located at <code>./app/index.js</code>.</li>
<li>It examines all of our <code>import</code> and <code>require</code> statements and creates a dependency graph.</li>
<li>webpack starts creating a bundle, whenever it comes across a path we have a loader for, it transforms the code according to that loader then adds it to the bundle.</li>
<li>It takes the final bundle and outputs it at <code>dist/index_bundle.js</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>We’ve seen how you can use loaders to work on individual files before or while the bundle is being generated. Unlike loaders, plugins allow you to execute certain tasks <strong>after</strong> the bundle has been created. Because of this, these tasks can be on the bundle itself, or just to your codebase. You can think of plugins as a more powerful, less restrictive version of loaders.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a few examples.</p>
<h4>HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Earlier we saw that the main benefit of webpack was that it would generate a single bundle for us that we could then use to reference inside of our main <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>What <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> does is it will generate this <code>index.html</code> page for us, stick it inside of the same directory where our bundle is put, and automatically include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag which references the newly generated bundle.</p>
<p>So in our example, because we’ve told webpack to name the final bundle <code>index_bundle.js</code> and put it in a folder called <code>dist</code>, when <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> runs, it’ll create a new <code>index.html</code> file, put it in <code>dist</code>, and include a script to reference the bundle, <code>&lt;script src='bundle_index.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>. Pretty nice, right? Because this file is being generated for us by <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>, even if we change the output path or …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Our research during the last few years definitely points out our interest in <strong>Fault Injection (FI)</strong> attacks. We produced numerous publications, which we presented at both <em><strong>academic</strong></em> and <em><strong>security</strong></em> conferences. Among other research, we showed that <strong>FI</strong> is an effective technique for for <strong>bypassing Secure Boot</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_BlackHat-EU_Bypassing-Secure-Boot-Using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS.pdf">2016</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_BlueHat-IL_Hardening-Secure-Boot-on-Embedded-Devices-for-Hostile-Environments_NT-AS-CM.pdf">2019</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload//research/2019/2019_Designing-Secure-Boot-Securely_NT-AS.pdf">2019</a>) and <strong>escalating privileges on Linux</strong> (<a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_FDTC_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>, <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_BlueHat-v17_KERNELFAULT-R00ting-the-Unexploitable-using-Hardware-Fault-Injection_CM_NT.pdf">2017</a> and <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2017/2017_Hardwear-io_Escalating-Privileges-in-Linux-using-Fault-Injection_NT-CM.pdf">2017</a>).</p>
<p>Like many of you, our curiosity is constantly sparked and therefore we cannot prevent ourselves from injecting glitches. This post will be your first peek into our new and exciting <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">presentation</a> at <a href="http://www.powerofcommunity.net/2019.htm#" target="_blank">POC2019</a> <em>advances</em> and <em>generalizes</em> the <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2016/2016_FDTC_Controlling-PC-on-ARM-using-Fault-Injection_NT-AS-MW.pdf">research</a> we published in 2016 at <a href="https://fdtc.deib.polimi.it/FDTC16/" target="_blank">FDTC</a>, where we showed that <em>“data transfers”</em> can yield <em>“arbitrary code execution”</em> using <strong>FI</strong>. During our demonstration live on stage we injected <strong>voltage glitches</strong> into the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview" target="_blank">Espressif ESP32</a> using the open source <a href="https://github.com/noopwafel/iceglitch" target="_blank">iceGLITCH</a>. More specifically, we showed how <strong>FI</strong> can be used to modify <strong>callx8 instructions</strong> in order to achieve <strong>arbitrary control</strong> of the <strong>program counter</strong> in situations where the attacker controls nothing more than just <strong>the data</strong> being transferred.</p>
<p>It's important to point out that our <strong>2016 research</strong> showed the program counter can be be controlled on processor architectures where it is directly addressable (e.g. ARMv7). Our <strong>2019 research</strong> showed that the program counter can be controlled even if the it is not directly addressable (e.g. ARMv8). Moreover, maybe even more relevant, this is possible leveraging <strong>common software constructs</strong> such as the  <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>Let us be clear…</p>
<p>You can perform these type of attack when you <strong>only</strong> control <strong>the data</strong> being transferred. Neither the <strong>destination</strong> nor the <strong>source</strong> of the data transfer needs to be controlled, <strong>just the data</strong> itself. Moreover, you can leverage <strong>common software constructs</strong> executed by <strong>privileged code</strong> (e.g. Kernel) that copy data from an untrusted domain (e.g. an communication interface or external data source like flash), which are present on any device. Then, if the underlying <strong>hardware is vulnerable</strong> to <strong>FI</strong>, and many standard chips are, you can achieve <strong>full control</strong> of the program counter, <strong>regardless</strong> of the processor architecture.</p>
<p>We disclosed our research to <strong>Espressif</strong> before the presentation. It was received with interest and we discussed the potential risk for the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip. Nonetheless, as the results were achieved in a <strong>fully controlled environment</strong> targeting <strong>test code</strong>, we agreed that the impact was minimal at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward to early 2020 and we obtained new hardware <strong>FI</strong> tooling to support our research endeavors. We decided to test our new capabilities on a target already available to us and that we were familiar with. We decided to focus on injecting electromagnetic (EM) glitches. We will refer to this technique as <strong>EMFI</strong>.</p>
<p>We started with a typical approach where we target test code that is entirely under our control in order to determine the resilience of the <strong>ESP32</strong> towards <strong>EM glitches</strong>. Once we determined the <strong>ESP32</strong> is vulnerable, we set our final goal to put our <a href="https://raelize.com/upload/research/2019/2019_PoC_Using-Fault-Injection-to-Turn-Data-Transfers-into-Arbitrary-Execution_CM-NT.pdf">2019</a> research into practice.</p>
<p>We decided our first step towards to this goal was to bypass the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> implementation of the <strong>ESP32</strong>. It's important to point out that when we started our research, several researchers already published <strong>FI</strong> attacks on this implementation for which Espressif issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">advisory</a>. Differently from the attacks already published, we used <strong>EM glitches</strong> instead of <strong>voltage glitches</strong> to <strong>trigger</strong> a similar hardware vulnerability. Our approach has several advantages, as <strong>EMFI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>typically requires no <strong>invasive modifications</strong> to the target</li>
<li>is somewhat <strong>localized</strong>,  as the EM field has a definite spatial distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, besides reproducing the already published attack, we identified several new approaches for exploiting the faults we introduce, which allow us to bypass both <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong>. By doing so, we also identified several <strong>new vulnerabilities</strong> for which <strong>Espressif</strong> issued an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">advisory</a>. <strong>Espressif</strong> indicated that these attacks do not apply to the the updated <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/ESP32_ECO_V3_User_Guide__EN.pdfe" target="_blank">ESP32 V3</a> and <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2" target="_blank">ESP32-S2</a> chips.</p>
<p>In this post we describe our approach for bypassing <strong>Secure Boot</strong> without <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> enabled (i.e. reproducing <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Security_Advisory_Concerning_Fault_Injection_and_Secure_Boot" target="_blank">CVE-2019-15894</a>) using <strong>EMFI</strong>. In several upcoming posts, which will be posted in the upcoming weeks, we will describe our other attacks, including the new vulnerabilities we identified (i.e. <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15048" target="_blank">CVE-2020-15048</a> and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13629" target="_blank">CVE-2020-13629</a>).</p>

<p>After over a decade of conducting <strong>FI</strong> testing and research, we know out of firsthand experience that the <strong>identification</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong> of <strong>FI</strong> vulnerabilities may require a long breath. It's not always so trivial as some may make you believe. <strong>Expert tooling</strong> in the hands of <em>advanced users</em>, can make a dramatic difference in the <strong>identification</strong> phase, let alone during the <strong>exploitation</strong> of the identified vulnerabilities. Therefore, we like to use <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">commercially available</a> tooling during our <strong>FI</strong> research.</p>
<p>We believe that our results may be achieved using low cost (e.g. <a href="http://store.newae.com/chipshouter-kit/" target="_blank">ChipShouter</a>) or Do-It-Yourself (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/BADFET" target="_blank">BADFET</a>) tooling as well. However, this type of tooling may be limiting and is often not able to sufficiently sweep the <strong>glitch parameter</strong> search space. Nonetheless, we believe that once a <strong>FI</strong> vulnerability is identified and exploited, and therefore the required <strong>glitch parameters</strong> are known, <strong>low cost tooling</strong> may be tuned or built to inject a successful glitch.</p>
<p>To set ourselves up for success, being able to sweep the glitch parameter search space efficiently, we use the following components to conduct our <strong>FI</strong> research:</p>

<p>We execute the Python framework offered by <a href="https://www.riscure.com/security-tools/inspector-fi/" target="_blank">Riscure Inspector FI</a> on our <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html" target="_blank">Intel NUC</a> in order to communicate with the above components. A logical representation of the setup is shown below.</p>

<p>We used the <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/esp32-developmentboard" target="_blank">ESP32 NodeMCU</a> modules available from <a href="https://www.az-delivery.de/en" target="_blank">AZ Delivery</a> which is shown in the picture below. These modules are designed around a <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We removed the metal casing of the <strong>ESP32-WROOM-32</strong> package in order to place the tip of the <strong>EM Probe</strong> on the chip's surface. This is the only modification we made to the target in order to inject <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>

<p>The most important <strong>glitch parameters</strong> when performing <strong>EMFI</strong>, are <strong>position</strong>, <strong>power</strong> and <strong>timing</strong>. Tuning these parameters is not always trivial, especially when targeting something specific like <strong>Secure Boot</strong>. The combined parameter search space can be huge, especially if a fine grid is used for spatial positioning. Therefore, we typically start with an intermediate step that allows us to determine efficiently where exactly a chip is sensitive to <strong>EM</strong> glitches.</p>
<p>It's relevant to point out, that the first step for <strong>FI</strong>, after building the setup, is to determine if the target is <strong>vulnerable</strong>. As such vulnerability is at the <strong>chip level</strong> (i.e. hardware), it does not matter if it is identified on a <strong>development board</strong> or an <strong>finalized device</strong> (i.e. the vulnerability is the same). That's why, if possible, we typically prefer to perform the initial research using a development board that's designed around the same or similar chip. Then, porting the attack to a finalized device, especially when the software is the same as well (e.g. ROM code), is often trivial.</p>
<h2 id="test-code">Test code</h2>
<p>The test code we use during this intermediate step includes a command handler with at least one command, which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive command byte</li>
<li>set trigger high</li>
<li>using assembly to initialize unused registers with known values</li>
<li>using assembly to increase a counter with add instructions (i.e add sled)</li>
<li>set trigger signal low</li>
<li>print the counter result</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the implementations used during our <strong>ESP32</strong> research is shown below. The test code allows us to identify a successful glitch by observing the counter printed on the <strong>serial interface</strong>. If the counter value is different than the expected value (i.e. 10,000), then the glitch we injected <strong>successfully</strong> affected the target's execution without preventing program continuation.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We generate the <strong>trigger high</strong> and the <strong>trigger low</strong> signal by driving a <strong>GPIO</strong> pin. This allows us to create a measurable <strong>attack window</strong> that encompasses the sled of <code>add</code> instructions. This increases our chances of injecting a successful glitch and allows us to identify the presence of a hardware vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>We use the <strong>Probe Station</strong> to automatically move the <strong>EM Probe</strong> across the chip's surface. The <strong>Spider</strong> waits until the <strong>trigger</strong> is set high, effectively injecting the glitch exactly within the attack window. The attack window is defined by the moment the <strong>trigger</strong> goes high and the <strong>trigger</strong> goes low. We randomize both the <strong>timing within the attack window</strong> and the <strong>power</strong> of the <strong>EM Probe</strong>. We used a <strong>30 x 30 grid</strong> for our initial experiment.</p>
<p>All experiments are grouped according to the behavior we observe. We assign a color to each experiment based on their group. All experiments that result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>no observable effect whatsoever are colored <span>green dots</span></li>
<li>a reset or mute of the chip are colored <span>yellow dots</span></li>
<li>a different counter value (i.e. successful glitch) are are colored <span>red diamonds</span></li>

I’ve laid out the index of topics covered in the post. </p><p>Depending on the stage of your journey, feel free to skip to the sections that are most relevant to you.<br></p><h3><strong>Topics covered in this post</strong></h3><ol role="list"><li>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</li><li>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</li><li>Standing out from competition</li><li>Shopify App Store optimisation basics</li><li>Find your #1 keyword</li><li>Getting customers to review your Shopify app (by delivering great customer support)</li><li>Getting the first customers for your Shopify app</li><li>Finding early users and beta testers for your Shopify app outside the App Store</li><li>Getting listed under the right categories &amp; collections, and getting featured on the Shopify App Store</li><li>The right pricing model for your Shopify app</li><li>Optimising for trials</li><li>Long term game plan in the Shopify App Store</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Why choose Shopify for your first micro-SaaS (and why you shouldn't)</strong></h2><p>Shopify isn’t the only choice when it comes to picking an apps marketplace. There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>by Valentin, July 25 2020, in <a href="http://foobuzz.github.io/tag/random/">random</a></p><p>One of the most important realizations that I have had about mathematics is the fact that there is no global definition of what "infinity" is. You can't just drop the word "infinite" in any context, as if one day mathematicians had a meeting to decide the meaning of "infinity" and made it an element of reasoning you can use with any mathematical thing.</p><p>In set theory, a set is "infinite" if, for every natural number, the set has a subset whose cardinality is that of this natural number. In functional analysis, a function has a limit L as <em>x</em> approaches "infinity" if, for any tiny ɛ, there is a point after which the function won't ever be farther from L than the distance ɛ. The term of "infinity" obviously comes from an intuition about the philosophical notion of infinity, but it is then defined formally using very traditional and non-mystical notions and notations, and there isn't any global notion of "infinity". You can't take some random mathematical thing and ask "What happens when this goes to infinity?".</p><p>Now, when someone comes and says "hey, do you know that 0.999 with an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point is equal to 1?", what most people do is that they try to picture the number 0.999 with an actual infinite number of nines after the decimal point and then they try to actually reason about this monstrosity. This is an interesting intellectual exercise, but when you're doing that, you're doing philosophy, not mathematics. If you want to do mathematics, what you should be asking back is "What is the definition of a number with a decimal repeating infinitely?"</p><p>There are multiple definitions for it, but the one that makes the most sense to me is an infinite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)#Convergent_series">series</a>. We can simply state that 0.999... can be written as 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + 0.0009 + ... Formally, it would be written as follows:</p><p><img src="http://foobuzz.github.io/assets/articles/09-series.svg"></p><p>This form is very helpful, because the notion of infinite series is very well defined. It is simply the limit of the sequence of the partial sums. In other words, 0.999... is the limit of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, etc. Let's call this sequence 0.(9)n for later reference. I like this definition because it reminds me of very important aspects of sequences and their limits that I learned when I was in school:</p><ol><li>There is no such thing as an "infinite term" of a sequence (and some teachers won't like it if you ever dare say something like that).</li><li>The limit of a sequence may very well be distinct than any of its terms.</li></ol><p>I think those two aspects are at the origin of the difficulty that there is to accept that 0.999... = 1. I think that the decimal representation with its "infinite digits" is misleading because it leads us to ponder the notion of an "infinite term" (of finite truncations) all while it is explicitly discouraged as soon as we actually consider the sequence of truncations itself. Then our minds are lost wandering in the vast pastures of infinity where it's hard to understand how a limit may not belong to the sequence itself. I think that what people really mean when they think that it's problematic that 0.999... = 1 is that the sequence of 0.(9)n <em>never</em> reaches 1 no matter how many time you look at the next term.</p><p>In other words, consider the set of all elements of the sequence: {0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, ...}. This set is obviously infinite, and 1, the limit of the sequence, does not belong to this set. When we ponder the notion of "infinity" in the context of 0.9..., what we might envision is the journey through this "infinite" set. With this in mind, it's hard to see how 1 can have anything to do with this, since it is outside the set.</p><p>But this begs the question: what is a "limit"? In layman terms, the limit of a sequence is a real number the sequence is ever getting closer to (without the requirement that it actually reaches it at any point). More formally, it means that for any tiny real number ɛ, there is a rank after which the sequence won't ever be farther from the limit than the distance ɛ. (This is the same definition than the one used in functional analysis I presented in the introduction.) Even without a formal proof, it seems pretty obvious than the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999,... has 1 for limit. And therefore, if you actually understand the proper meaning of the notation, that 0.999... = 1.</p><p>Now, since the limit of an increasing sequence also happens to be its supremum (least upper bound), this leads us to another definition, which is the one that is actually used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...">Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations.</p></blockquote><p>What this means is that if you take the sequence 0.(9)n, then the number that is written "0.999..." or said to have "an infinite amount of 9s after the decimal point" is the smallest number that is greater than all terms of the sequence. For example, 3 is greater than all the terms of the sequence, so that's a candidate. Is it the smallest such number? Well, certainly not. 2 is greater than all terms of the sequence and it is lesser than 3. Can we find smaller? Sure. 1 is greater than all terms of the sequence. Is there something even smaller? Hmm... doesn't seem so. I think 1 is the smallest. This, of course, is only intuition so far, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...#Formal_proof">the proof</a> is easy enough to follow.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Around November of last year, I started a project to wrangle my digital life. Tired of haphazardly increasing my subjectivity by trusting "free" websites to provide various services, I wanted to wrest some control over my internet existence. I made a plan to self-host several "critical" services on my home network and maintain them personally. In short, I made a homelab.</p>
<p>To be frank, the professional websites that I was previously dependent upon are undoubtedly more reliable than my cobbled-together hobby project of a homelab. However, on general principle (and because it seemed like a fun way to learn some sysadmin / devops skills), I made this setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/homelab-network-diagram.svg" alt="Homelab Network Diagram"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have deployed a couple of general-purpose compute platforms: 4 ESXi hypervisors, and a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, there are several VM-based services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. For data storage and backup, I use a Synology NAS. Finally, a custom OpenBSD-based router provides internet connectivity to everything. In order to reduce operational overhead, I crafted <a href="https://github.com/0xC45/homelab-setup">a set of Ansible scripts</a> that deploy and configure all of these components.</p>
<p>Overall, making this setup has been quite a journey. In this blog post, I will describe my uses for each of these services, share my thoughts and experiences so far, and attempt to articulate my future improvement plans.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Of course, everything you see above already exists as a service on the internet. If my goal were solely the end feature set, it would have been much simpler to pay for each service. In most cases, there are even "free" versions available. For example, if I only cared about having access to a web-based git repository UI, I could have signed up for a Github or Gitlab account rather than bother setting up a Gitea VM on my home network.</p>
<p>However, like most of my hobby projects, this endeavor was more about the journey than the destination. By setting up these services on my home network, I learned a bunch of useful devops and sysadmin skills. Additionally, by running my own services, I have achieved the philosophical goal of reducing my reliance on 3rd party services. Now, if any of the services that I rely upon break, I am empowered to fix them. I am no longer dependent on the "opaque box" that is Google Drive, for example.</p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>So, without further ado, let's dive into each of the components that make up my homelab. For each component, I will describe the main utility it provides me, why I chose it, and any additional commentary that may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="router">Router</h3>
<p>The first component of my homelab is a custom OpenBSD-based router. It provides internet connectivity and DHCP to everything on my home network. Additionally, the device serves as a caching DNS server and firewall. I could write an entire blog post describing this router in excruciating detail. In fact, I <a href="https://0xc45.com/blog/openbsd-home-router/">already have</a>.</p>
<h3 id="esxi-hosts">ESXi Hosts</h3>
<p>In total, I maintain four physical <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html">ESXi</a> hosts to form a platform for running virtual machines on my network.</p>
<p>Three of the ESXi hosts are Intel NUCs (System76 Meerkats). These smaller machines run the VMs that form my Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>The other ESXi host is a custom machine built from spare parts. It currently runs three VM-based HTTPS services: Nextcloud, Gitea, and Harbor. Because it only runs three (relatively small) VMs, it has quite a bit of spare compute power leftover for future additions and/or temporary experiments.</p>
<p>I chose ESXi to run my virtual machines because it's enterprise quality and free. There are many hypervisors out there. For my current use case, ESXi is perfect. Also, in the future, I may consider expanding my use of VMware products by running vCenter to programmatically manage virtual machines, setting-up vSAN for shared storage, and potentially installing NSX if my networking requirements become more complicated. So, there is room to grow.</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-cluster">Kubernetes Cluster</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM-based compute platform provided by ESXi, I run Kubernetes to provide a container-based compute platform. Though I do not currently use my Kubernetes cluster for anything, I have plans to setup <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo CI/CD</a>, experiment with <a href="https://knative.dev/">kNative</a>, develop some operators, and maybe run a <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/factorio">factorio game server</a>.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes cluster consists of 6 VMs running across 3 Intel NUCs. I chose to install Kubernetes on VMs with the ESXi hypervisor layer for ease of management. At some point, I'm sure to break things, want to reconfigure, etc. With the hypervisor, it's easier to perform these type of adjustments. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I may switch to <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid">TKG</a>, a vSphere-integrated distribution of Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="synology-nas">Synology NAS</h3>
<p>For backups and storing important data, I use a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS218+">Synology NAS</a>. Though I didn't really shop around and compare NAS products / vendors, I am happy with the Synology so far. That being said, I would like to create my own NAS from scratch at some point in the future. However, the Synology product includes several features "out-of-the-box" that would be potentially difficult to replicate.</p>
<p>First, it has an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_backup_business">"Active Backup for Business"</a> that can automatically take backups of ESXi virtual machines following configurable schedules and retention policies.</p>
<p>The VM backup application pairs nicely with the automatic cloud backup application, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/GlacierBackup">"Glacier Backup"</a>. Every night, after the VMs are backed-up to the NAS, I replicate the backups to Amazon S3 Glacier. Hopefully, this way I won't ever lose data.</p>
<p>Finally, the Synology has built-in UPS integration. If <a href="https://www.apc.com/shop/us/en/products/APC-Power-Saving-Back-UPS-Pro-1500/P-BR1500G">my UPS</a> loses power for more than one minute, the NAS will cleanly shutdown, preventing any data corruption that could be caused by an unexpected power loss.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud-vm">Nextcloud VM</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> as my "personal cloud". I use it to store my important files and photos. The desktop / mobile application synchronizes the files across all of my devices, allowing me to edit and view my files from anywhere. </p>
<p>Nextcloud also has the capability to install "apps" that provide additional functionality. Currently, I have only installed one app, <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck">"Deck"</a>. Deck is a Kanban-style project management and organization tool. I use Deck to plan, organize, and record progress on my hobby projects.</p>
<p>Because it gives me the capability to install (and potentially create) apps, Nextcloud is an extensible platform. It's open source and under active development. Though the recent major version upgrade was a bit rocky (for me, at least), I'm happy with Nextcloud and plan to stick with it.</p>
<h3 id="gitea-vm">Gitea VM</h3>
<p>Of course, I need a place to store my code. For that purpose, I use <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a>. I prefer Gitea to Gitlab because it's lighter-weight. Unlike Gitlab, there aren't a million additional features bundled-in that add bloat (in my opinion). Also, I slightly prefer the Gitea UI over the Gitlab UI.</p>
<p>There's really not much else to say about Gitea. It works great for my purposes. I push all of my code to the Gitea VM running on my home network. Whenever I want to "publish" a project or share it with the world, I push my code to a public Github repo.</p>
<h3 id="harbor-vm">Harbor VM</h3>
<p>To make container images available for running on my Kubernetes cluster, I need a container registry. For this purpose, I use <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a>, an open source solution that seems to be the current most popular self-hosted container registry. In addition to providing a standard API for pushing/pulling container images, Harbor has the useful capability to scan container images for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Harbor has worked well for me so far, but I haven't really placed it under a serious workload. Soon, I will start using my Kubernetes cluster for various projects, which will require pushing / pulling images from Harbor on a regular basis. Perhaps, at some point in the future, I will have a more nuanced opinion of Harbor.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Though I am happy with the current setup, I continually find myself coming up with ideas for potential improvements and additions to the homelab. Here are a couple of the more well-defined ideas.</p>
<p>First, I want to install <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">Argo</a> on the Kubernetes cluster to run pipeline-based workflows. For example, it could be useful to automatically run tests for every commit that gets pushed to my repositories on Gitea. More generally, I could configure Argo to trigger a job for any arbitrary external event. It could be used to create a notification service. Or, it could be used to manage heavy workloads. There are endless potential uses for a pipeline-based workflow engine such as Argo.</p>
<p>Second, I want to create a dashboard that provides a graphical representation of the status of each of my homelab components using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. Using various open-source tools, I could collect metrics and aggregate them. Then, using Grafana, I could visualize the data. It would be useful to be able to quickly ascertain the state of my home network services in order to understand workloads, diagnose issues, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the work spanning several months, creating my homelab has been quite a journey. Along the way, I started to grow weary, concerned that I had signed myself up for the all-consuming task of operating my homelab. With the overhead required to maintain all the various components, how could I ever have time for anything else? However, I'm happy to report that the Ansible script automation has proved worthwhile. Now, upgrades, configuration changes, and various "day 2" operations are quick and simple. At this point, I'm looking forward to shifting gears and working on something else for a while, using my homelab services as helpful tools along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/huawei-hacked-my-laptop">Huawei Hacked My Laptop?</a></p><p><img alt="" src="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29436/20200725_180027.huawei-xhost.png?width=500&amp;height=444"></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a script called "Huawei Autorun" which executes the command "xhost +" when you login. This command makes your Linux desktop remotely accessible to anyone on the network. The "Huawei Autorun" script appeared on my laptop after installing a Huawei E353 HSPA+ 3G USB stick (with serial number CE0682 on the back).</p>

<p>It seems like I dodged a bullet as I don't use the standard Linux GNOME desktop, so the script was not enabled, but the fact remains that Huawei installed malware on my Linux laptop. If they managed to get into my laptop, imagine what is happening inside your phone.</p>

<p>State-sponsored hacking is real.</p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE----</strong></p>

<p>For those people who requested more information. The OS is Debian 8.1 LTS. The script is basically a one-liner embedded in an autostart launcher (see below). It was installed as root, so I must have screwed up big time there. Obviously, I'll&nbsp;have to reinstall my OS.&nbsp;Debian 8 is at end of life&nbsp;now anyway.</p>

<pre>$ cat /etc/xdg/autostart/HuaweiAutoStart.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Huawei  AutoRun
Name[en_US]=Huawei AutoRun
<strong>Exec=xhost +</strong>

Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
URL=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
GenericName[en_US]=</pre>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 2----</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I decided to check out this modem. It does include Linux drivers which require root for installation. I reran the installation script as root and sure enough the same autostart script was reinstalled.</p>

<pre>$ ls /etc/xdg/autostart/ -l
total 116
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  305 Oct 10  2014 at-spi-dbus-bus.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6351 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7777 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7339 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-secrets.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5996 Oct 21  2014 gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7741 Aug 27  2014 gsettings-data-convert.desktop
<strong>-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  262 Jul 25 23:59 HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</strong>
<span>....</span>
</pre>

<p>This script is also installed to <span>$HOME/.config/autostart/</span><span>HuaweiAutoStart.desktop</span>. Another script called <span>ReadDisplay</span> is&nbsp;installed in <span>/usr/local/modem</span> which&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;<span>$DISPLAY</span>&nbsp;environment variable to a binary&nbsp;called <span>MobilePartner</span>. The drivers do include a GUI, but if the sole purpose of all this is to fire up a GUI then it is not only exceptionally sloppy code, but also a&nbsp;security risk that needs explaining.</p>

<p>Below is a tarball image of the huawei e353 drivers so you can audit them for yourself. I've included the Windows drivers so you get an image of the disk just as I have it. Heck you could even try it for yourself. The drivers didn't compile the second time I did this, but the autostart script was still installed.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunburnt.com.au/ox/webcore/attachments/29437/huawei-e353-malware.tar.gz">Download huawei e353 drivers (warning, possible malware!)</a></p>

<p><strong>----UPDATE 3----</strong></p>

<p>I'm giving Huawei the benefit of doubt on this one. As a commenter suggested, it is probably a hack to run the GUI as root. Either way, it is still a nasty vulnerability, even if your X server is configured to use local sockets by default. I guess this&nbsp;shows the folly of blindly trusting hardware manufactures. I'll be sticking to open source code from official repositories in the future.</p>

<p>Live and learn, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Based on the article, I would think it is just a sloppy and lazy implementation, but the title does served as a bait clicker. The comment where avoiding pure chinese company or there is at least American company involved will be pure ignorance&nbsp;or turning a blind eye on what is happening around the world and purely cynical. Every country spying on people when they have the means and ways. So don't even think for a second that&nbsp;&nbsp;an American company involvement will make it any better. That will be pure ignorant.<br>
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10403598/35-world-leaders-had-their-phones-monitored-by-US-spies.html</a></p>

    
  <p>It's more likely the package installed some graphical configuration tool that needs to run as root. Running "xhost +" is a lazy way to enable programs running as root to connect to your non-root user's X11 session.</p>

<p>I don't know what debian's default settings are regarding Xorg and networking, but on my laptop Xorg appears to only be listening on unix sockets, which are obviously not accessible from the whole network.</p>

    
  <blockquote>
<p><span>State-sponsored hacking is real.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Yes. It's happening. 14 eyes (US+others) are also doing it. So I don't trust US services and devices either.</span></p>

<p><span>While they're banning each other of different things, open hardware is rising up and welcoming everyone (for example RISC V). We need things like this in this world to bring in peace so that they don't fight over silli things.</span></p>

    
  <p>Clean the system, you most likely found one piece of the drop. Replace the drive, looks to be a long weekend</p>

    
  <p>I avoid any pure Chinese tech, where possible. By law in China, all companies must work with the CCP (which means the military). Obviously, iPhones and such are made in China, although production is starting to move to other countries under Trump's trade policies, but at least there is an American company involved on the HW and SW sides.</p>

    
  <p>Did inserting the Huawei E353 dongle attach a virtual CD-ROM drive that you manually installed drivers from? I know for a fact similar devices (eg, ZTE MF910) offer drivers this way. The generic Linux USB ethernet driver worked fine, so there's no need to install Huawei or ZTE's driver.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning USB On-The-Go devices (including Android phones and 4G modems) have relatively powerful processors running a wide variety of network services, including an insecure web server (for the end-user web configuration interface), high-precision location, a high bandwidth internet side-channel (the 4G connection itself) while also having the ability to act as any USB client device (including keyboards to send keystrokes). They are an incredibly powerful platform for targeted cyberattacks and I imagine state actors are using them very often.</p>

July 25, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt3/">previous post</a> we have written code to change the amplitude of wave files.</p>
<p>Now we’ll take a look at how we can turn a mono wave file into a stereo wave file with an optional
panning, and explore how this is represented internally by the WAVE file format.</p>

<p>The raw audio data inside a WAVE file consists of multiple frames. For now, we have called them
‘samples’ although that is strictly speaking not entirely correct. In fact, single float in the raw
audio data only corresponds to a single sample when we assume a mono audio file.</p>
<p>When you have multiple channels, a single ‘sample’ can consist of multiple frames. As each channel
needs to play a certain ‘frame’ at any given point in time.</p>
<p>In the WAVE file format, the channels are interleaved. For example, a stereo file would be
laid out like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/interleaving.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, each sample consists of two frames. Such that frame 1 and 2 make up sample 1, frame 3 and 4
make up sample 2, and so on..</p>
<p>Programs know how to interpret the raw audio data because of the <code>fmt</code> chunk inside the audio file,
which specifies the number of channels that are present in the raw audio data. The maximum number of
channels in a wave file is actually as high as 65,536, which does not actually make sense for audio
data.</p>
<p>Some common ones would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-channel: mono</li>
<li>2-channel: stereo</li>
<li>3-channel: stereo + center channel</li>
<li>4-channel: Quadrophonic</li>
<li>5-channel: “Surround sound”</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience though, we’ll mostly work on mono and stereo files. Not only are they the most
commonly used, this also allows us to test our code without needing a more expensive setup.</p>

<p>So what is a pan? When you pan an audio signal, you essentially make an audio signal ‘louder’ on
either the left or the right side. Typically in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> this would be represented by an ‘automation
track’ between the value of -1 to 1.</p>
<p>The program to apply a pan will take three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>input file</li>
<li>output file</li>
<li>pan (-1 to 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the input file we will restrict this to mono files, and for the output files we will always
generate a stereo file. The pan variable should be between -1 (left) and 1 (right). Before we can
start applying our pan, we need to read the raw audio data from an input wave file. Remember that to
read the wave file we will use the <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> library we made
earlier:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>import</span> (
        <span>wav</span> <span>"github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/wave"</span>
)
</code></pre></div><p>The set up for this program is rather simple, we will use the build-in <code>flags</code> package to parse the
input from the CLI.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> (
	<span>input</span>  = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"i"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"input file"</span>)
	<span>output</span> = <span>flag</span>.<span>String</span>(<span>"o"</span>, <span>""</span>, <span>"output file"</span>)
	<span>pan</span>    = <span>flag</span>.<span>Float64</span>(<span>"p"</span>, <span>0.0</span>, <span>"pan in range of -1 (left) to 1 (right)"</span>)
)
</code></pre></div><p>Once we have our flags set up, we can parse them and read the input file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>flag</span>.<span>Parse</span>()
	<span>infile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span>
	<span>outfile</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>output</span>
	<span>panfac</span> <span>:=</span> <span>*</span><span>pan</span>
	<span>wave</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>ReadWaveFile</span>(<span>infile</span>)
	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>"Could not parse wave file"</span>)
	}
        <span>...</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>So far so good. We have parsed the input so we know which value to use for our pan, and we have read
the raw audio data as well. But how do we go from a value in the range of (-1) to (1) to an actual
change in loudness on the left or right-side? We can imagine that a simple function would look like
this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>panposition</span> <span>struct</span> {
	<span>left</span>, <span>right</span> <span>float64</span>
}

<span>func</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>position</span> <span>float64</span>) <span>panposition</span> {
	<span>position</span> <span>*=</span> <span>0.5</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>panposition</span>{
		<span>left</span>:  <span>position</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span>,
		<span>right</span>: <span>position</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span>,
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using a struct that can represent the amplitude on a scale of 0 to 1 for both the left
and right channel. Such that we observe the following values:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>position</th>
<th>left-channel</th>
<th>right-channel</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, if the position is zero the sound is perfectly balanced between the left and
right-side of your headphones. And in the extreme values, the sound is either only left-sided or
right-sided.</p>
<p>Just like in the previous post, we actually need to alter the frames based on the position data we
found in the <code>calculatePosition</code> function. We can create a function that modifies the frames based
on the <code>panposition</code> returned in the previous function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>frames</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>, <span>p</span> <span>panposition</span>) []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span> {
	<span>out</span> <span>:=</span> []<span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>{}
	<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>s</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>frames</span> {
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>left</span>))
		<span>out</span> = append(<span>out</span>, <span>wav</span>.<span>Frame</span>(float64(<span>s</span>)<span>*</span><span>p</span>.<span>right</span>))
	}
	<span>return</span> <span>out</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice how for each <code>frame</code> we actually append two <code>frames</code> to the resulting slice! That is how we
are interleaving the left and right audio channel.</p>
<p>Now we can finish up the main method:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">        <span>...</span>
	<span>pos</span> <span>:=</span> <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>)
	<span>scaledFrames</span> <span>:=</span> <span>applyPan</span>(<span>wave</span>.<span>Frames</span>, <span>calculatePosition</span>(<span>panfac</span>))
	<span>wave</span>.<span>NumChannels</span> = <span>2</span> <span>// samples are now stereo, so we need dual channels
</span><span></span>	<span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>wav</span>.<span>WriteFrames</span>(<span>scaledFrames</span>, <span>wave</span>.<span>WaveFmt</span>, <span>outfile</span>); <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
		panic(<span>err</span>)
	}
</code></pre></div><p>A crucial step here is that before writing the samples we have set ran <code>wave.NumChannels=2</code>. Without
this, the wave file would be interpreted as a mono sound file and our panning effect would have been
lost.</p>

<p>To test this, I find it easy to use an input file without a lot of things going on. I’m mainly using
this simple <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/mono.wav">mono file</a>.</p>
<p>If we run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o left-side.wav -p -1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/left-side.wav">left-side.wav</a></p>
<p>And when we  run <code>go run main.go -i mono.wav -o right-side.wav -p 1</code> we get:</p>
<p><a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part4/right-side.wav">right-side.wav</a></p>

<p>There is actually a flaw with this panning function that we are using. However it is not apparent to
us yet because we can only set a pan for an entire audio source. To see why this panning function is
not perfect we need to first introduce breakpoints as a way to create automation tracks, so the focus for our next few posts will be
breakpoints. :-)</p>

<em>(If you plan to develop a white-label mobile app, JUST DON'T!!!</em> 😅 <em>But this is a story for another post.)</em>
I implemented a <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> that was very tightly coupled with back-end implementation.</p><p>The PRs were created, reviewed, and approved by front-end and back-end teams.
Everything was tested, some small bugs were found, I fixed them and was ready for merging to <code>master</code> branch.
But some severe bugs and priority features had to be done,
so the back-end developer had to switch working on them and the back-end implementation was not shipped in production.</p><p>I didn't want to merge my commits in <code>master</code> branch,
as the implementation in back-end may be changed after addition of other requirements
and decided to wait until the back-end developer will be free and ready to merge his implementations.</p><p>I thought that the feature will be shipped the week after.</p><p>Meanwhile, I started working on the next feature that was based on the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
When I finished I didn't create a new PR in <code>master</code> branch as the <code>feature2</code> branch included changes from <code>feature10</code>.
After a week I asked the back-end developer about the status with <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> shipment to production,
but he was busy with other tasks and as the app was in active development I continued developing on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>I was working alone in that repo and the front-end devs were helping me only with pair programming or opinions on feature implementations.
No one needed my changes and I took the easy path of just working on features/bugs and creating builds directly for testers and onboarding clients.</p><p>Time has passed, the back-end developer forgot about the <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong>.
I was working on features and bug fixes.
<code>feature5</code>, <code>feature10</code>, <code>feature13</code>, <code>bugfix12</code>, <code>refactor2</code> branches were all created on top of <strong><code>big-feature</code></strong> branch.</p><p>One day I understood that the PR in <code>master</code> branch will be an <strong>ENORMOUS</strong> lesson for me and the team.
Another developer joined the project so I created a new <code>dev</code> branch from <code>feature16</code> and for the last 2 weeks, we created and reviewed PRs in <code>dev</code> branch.</p><p>Finally after <strong>140 days</strong> from the beginning of <strong>BIG FEATURE</strong> the back-end implementation was merged and shipped to prod.</p><p>And I was ready for <strong>my biggest Pull Request</strong> <em>(so far)</em>.</p><h2>The Pull Request</h2><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!<br></p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.</p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after 8 seconds or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.</p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximise the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behaviour of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning a pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of&nbsp; that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example for <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br></p><p>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviours you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviours and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.</p><p>📕 This chapter is part of my upcoming book <em>“TL;DR — a book about productivity by a procrastination master”</em>.

<hr>



<h4>How is Human Unitec International (HMNU) capitalizing on the GRONE?</h4>



<p>HMNU struck a $40.8m binding purchase agreement with Palladium Investments SA, of Lugano, Switzerland on June 11, 2020, to build the first GRONE plant in Saudi Arabia. This purchase agreement includes six plants.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1633883">June 29<sup>th</sup> release</a>, HMNU has successfully launched their prototype for a 10-ton capacity recycling plant with Grupo Sedda of Porto Torres. This plant is currently conducting operations for <span>tire recycling</span>. <span>The average annual net income to be generated is $1.8m USD.</span> With a budgeted investment cap at only $2m.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/HMNU/news/story?e&amp;id=1636270">June, 30<sup>th</sup></a> an extension was made to include a second GRONE purchase. However, this one is for <span>plastic recycling</span>, with a 10-ton max for electricity production.</p>



<p>Group Sedda founder, Andrea Sedda commented on the deal, “We are very happy to have the chance to build this fantastic equipment in Sardinia. The GRONE plant represents a significant evolution in the growth of the renewable green energy for our country and our environment. Economically, a 10 tons plant is able to produce up to 8 tons of green eco diesel a day, equal to 12,600,000 KW/year or over Euros (€) 2,772,000 in net revenues.”</p>

<p><strong>PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language</strong> and until the year
of 2015 php had no support for statically declared types at all. One
could cast to scalar types explicitly in the code, but declaring scalar
types in methods and functions signatures wasn't a thing until PHP 7.0
with the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/scalar_type_hints_v5">Scalar Type Declarations</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types">Return Type Declarations</a> rfcs.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that from version 7.0 PHP became a statically typed
language, though. <strong>It has type hinting that can be analyzed statically</strong>
but <strong>it still supports dynamic types</strong> and even allows them to be mixed.
See the example below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function returnsInt(): int
{
  return '100';
}</code></pre>
<p>No doubt that <strong>there's a type mismatch there</strong>. The return type is
supposed to be <em>int</em> and the returned type is in fact a <em>string</em>. Now,
what PHP does there is to automatically transform the token '100'
into an integer in order to return the required type. Even though it
seems to have an extra cost, it doesn't. PHP's type juggling is <em>nearly</em>
cost-free in many cases.</p>
<p>To better clarify how the language deals with types I'll split this article
into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</a></li>
<li><a href="#union-types">Union Types</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-juggling">PHP's type juggling</a></li>
<li><a href="#php-type-modes">PHP type modes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have suggestions on what to add here, feel free to
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">reach out to me on twitter</a> or opening an issue on
github.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-types-in-php">Kinds of types in php</h2>
<p>PHP's type system is very simplified when it comes to language features.
For example there's no <em>char</em> type, or <em>unsigned</em> types or even <em>int8</em>,
<em>int16</em>, <em>int32</em>, <em>int64</em>...</p>
<p>The <em>char</em> type is simplified to a string type and all <em>integer</em> variations
are simplified into an <em>integer</em> type. Whether that's a good or bad thing, is
up to you.</p>
<p>One can always inspect a variable's type using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> function or using
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a> function and
checking its output.</p>
<p>PHP comes with three different kinds of types: <strong>scalar types</strong>, <strong>compound types</strong>
and <strong>special types</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scalar types</h3>
<p>Scalar types are the bare bones of the language and they are four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean (<code>bool</code> | <code>boolean</code>)</li>
<li>Integer (<code>int</code> | <code>integer</code>)</li>
<li>Float (<code>float</code> | <code>double</code>)</li>
<li>String (<code>string</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By definition scalar types do not carry behaviour or state with themselves.
Expressions like <code>100-&gt;toString()</code> or <code>'thephp.website'::length()</code> are invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: scalar values do not have behaviour or state, they just represent
a value.</strong></p>
<h3>Compound types</h3>
<p>Compound types are much more interesting because even though they are very similar
to the scalar type, <strong>each one of the four compound types carry different syntactic
capabilities.</strong></p>
<p>The four compound types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#compound-type-array">array</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-object">object</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-callable">callable</a></li>
<li><a href="#compound-type-iterable">iterable</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compound-type-array">The array compound type</h4>
<p>An array is in fact a hashmap, built-in to the language. Meaning that it stores
values in a <strong>key =&gt; value</strong> manner. Even if you use it purely as a vector.</p>
<p>Arrays are very flexible structures when it comes to size, internal types and
key-value mapping. The examples below are all valid arrays:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$vec = [0, 1, 2];
// $vec[1] is int(1)

$map = ['a' =&gt; 1, 'b' =&gt; 2];
// $map['a'] is int(1)

$map_ish = ['a' =&gt; 1, 0 =&gt; 2];
// $map_ish['a'] is int(1)
// $map_ish[0] =&gt; is int(2)</code></pre>
<p>Unlike C, php won't require you to define an array's size before creating it.
This of course comes with a memory consumption cost: the bigger your array size,
the more memory you'll consume in crazy proportions (in fact, arrays are allocated in powers of two).
How this consumption works is out of the scope of this article,
<a href="https://twitter.com/nawarian">feel free to ping me if you'd like to hear more</a>.</p>
<p>In case you're curious about this statement, the video below presents some charts
and further insights on arrays vs. object memory profiles.</p>

<p>As you'll see bellow, arrays are also considered to be of type <em>iterable</em>, meaning
that you can iterate over them using a <em>foreach</em> loop. But they also provide
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">specific functions that can manipulate their internal pointers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: array is an extremely flexible compound type that can be perceived
as a HashMap and is also considered an iterable type.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-object">The object compound type</h4>
<p>Due to php's architecture, the <em>object</em> compound type normally has a much lower memory
consumption profile when compared with arrays. That's because <em>normally</em> one would use
the object type by creating instances of classes.</p>
<p>Objects can carry state and behaviour. Meaning that php will offer dereferencing
language structs to access an object's internals. The snippet below illustrates
a php object's derefs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  private const A = 1;
  public int $property = 0;
  public function method(): void {}
}

$obj = new MyClass();
// $obj is object(MyClass)
// $obj::A is int(1)
// $obj-&gt;property is int(0)
// $obj-&gt;method() is null</code></pre>
<p>An object can also be normally created as a result of a type cast from an array.
Transforming an array's keys into objects property names. Such cast will always
result in an <code>object(stdClass)</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) ['a' =&gt; 1];
// $obj is object(stdClass)
// $obj-&gt;a is int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Important to notice that casting an array with numeric keys into an object is valid,
but one can't dereference its value because property names may not start with numbers.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = (object) [0, 1]; // Legal
$obj-&gt;0; // Illegal</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: objects normally have lower memory profiles than arrays, they carry
state and behaviour, they all inherit from stdClass and can be created by casting an
array.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-callable">The callable compound type</h4>
<p>A callable in php is anything that can be called (oh don't you say!!) with parenthesis
or with the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php">call_user_func()</a>
function. In other words, a callable can fulfil the responsibility of what we know as
functions. Functions and methods are always callables. Objects and classes may also become
callables.</p>
<p>A callable can, by definition, have its reference stored in a variable. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$callable = 'strlen';</code></pre>
<p>What? But that's a string, no?</p>
<p>Well, yes. But it can be coerced into a callable if necessary. Like below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function callACallable(
  callable $f
): int {
  return $f('thephp.website');
}

$callable = 'strlen';

var_dump(
  $callable('thephp.website')
);
// int(14)

var_dump(
  callACallable($callable)
);
// int(14)</code></pre>
<p>Callables may also point to object methods:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyClass
{
  public function myMethod(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
var_dump([$obj, 'myMethod']());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p>Looks odd? I know it looks like an array. In fact it is. Unless you name it a callable 👀</p>
<p>This kind of callable above (object-method reference) is very interesting because
<strong>you can call private or protected methods</strong> with it <strong>if you're inside the class' scope.</strong>
Otherwise you may only call public methods with it.</p>
<p>Also classes that implement
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.invoke">the __invoke() magic method</a>,
automatically transform their instances into callables themselves. Like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class MyCallableClass
{
  public function __invoke(): int
  {
    return 1;
  }
}

$obj = new MyCallableClass();
var_dump($obj());
// int(1)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: callables hold reference to functions or methods and can be
constructed in different ways.</strong></p>
<h4 id="compound-type-iterable">The iterable compound type</h4>
<p>Iterables are simpler to explain: they are by definition an array or an instance of
the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php">Traversable interface</a>. The
main thing of an iterable is that it can be used in a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php">foreach() loop</a>, with a
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php#control-structures.yield.from">yield from statement</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array">spread operator</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of iterables are:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

function generator_function(): Generator
{
  // ...
};

// All variables here are iterables
$a = [0, 1, 2];
$b = generator_function();
$c = new ArrayObject();</code></pre>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: if you can fit it in a foreach(), it is an iterable.</strong></p>
<h3>Special Types</h3>
<p>There are two special types. And the biggest reason why they're called special, is that
<strong>you can't cast these types</strong>. The special types are both the <strong>resource</strong> type and
the <strong>NULL</strong> type.</p>
<p><strong>A resource represents a handle to an external resource</strong>. It can be a file handle,
an I/O stream or a database connection handle. You may guess now why you can't convert
a resource to any other type.</p>
<p><strong>The null type represents a null value</strong>. Meaning that a variable holding NULL was not
initialized, assigned to NULL or unset during runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaway: a special typed value can't be casted to anything.</strong></p>
<h3>What about class instances?</h3>
<p>Class instances have the type <code>object</code> and will always be presented like so. Executing
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gettype">gettype()</a> on an object will always return
a <code>string("object")</code> and calling <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump">var_dump()</a>
on an object will always print its value using the <code>object(ClassName)</code> notation. If you need
to fetch an object's class as a string, use the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-class">get_class()</a> function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$obj = new stdClass();

echo gettype($obj);
// object

var_dump($obj);
// object(stdClass)#1 (0) {
// ...

echo get_class($obj);
// \stdClass</code></pre>
<h2 id="type-operations-in-php">Type "operations" in php</h2>
<p>There are different "operations" one can do with PHP when it comes to types. I believe
it is important to clearly state them here so that we don't mix things up later on.</p>
<h3>Type juggling: type casting and coercion</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, here are three important definitions we need keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type conversion</strong> means to transform a type from A to B. For example: from integer to float.</li>
<li><strong>Type cast</strong> means to <strong>manually</strong> or <strong>explicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$hundred = (int) 100.0</code>. (<code>float(100.0)</code> became <code>int(100)</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Type coercion</strong> means to <strong>implicitly</strong> convert a type from A to B. As in <code>$twenty = 10 + '10 bananas';</code>. (<code>string("10 bananas")</code> became <code>int(10)</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Being that said, the following sections explain how it happens in php. Later on you'll find
more information on Type Juggling.</p>
<h4>Type casting</h4>
<p>Similar to what Java does, php allows type casting. Meaning that when a variable points to
a value that can be casted to a different type, it allows manual (explicit) type conversion.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. What!? 🤨</p>
<p>Given a variable <code>$hundred</code> holding a <code>string("100")</code> its value may be manually converted (casted)
to become an <code>int(100)</code> or a <code>float(100.00)</code> - or any other scalar type or one of compound
types <em>array</em> or <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The following snippet works just fine in PHP and is very similar to Java:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

$hundred = (int) '100';
// $hundred is now int(100)</code></pre>
<p>Now, one thing Java does and is completely illegal on php code, is to …</p></iframe></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9357"><div><div><div><h2>Amazon’s venture capital fund accused of investing in small companies just to steal their ideas</h2><p>Jeff Bezos’ owned world’s biggest eCommerce firm is actually a predator! Amazon is reportedly using its venture capital arm to fund startups only to steal business ideas from them. Amazon is accused of investing in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. The e-commerce retailer then uses this confidential information to launch its own service based on such data.</p><p>According to a report in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tech-startup-echo-bezos-alexa-investment-fund-11595520249">Wall Street Journal(Paywall)</a>, Amazon.com’s venture-capital fund invested in DefinedCrowd and gained access to the technology startup’s finances and other confidential information. Four years later the marketplace launched a similar artificial intelligence product that does almost exactly what DefinedCrowd does.</p><p>DefinedCrowd founder and CEO Daniela Braga has accused Amazon of stealing their concept to launch its own product. Amazon recently launched a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) product called A2I. DefinedCrowd CEO says that it is completely based on their product and competes directly with them. And all this under the garb of venture capital funding.</p><p>Another company that suffered a similar fate was LivingSocial. LivingSocial officials met with Amazon’s venture capital firm to discuss a potential investment. At the end of the talks, Amazon purchased 30 percent of LivingSocial equity. After buying the share in LivingSocial, Amazon requested access to proprietary LivingSocial data. In a few months, Amazon started reaching out to its own clients offering better deals for similar products.</p><p>Even Amazon’s Echo seems to have been developed using this predatory thieving. A company that built Ubi, a smart speaker was in talks with Amazon for seed funding. The Ubi officials met with Amazo several times to discuss funding and concepts. It was just a matter of days before Amazon launched a similar product to Ubi- Amazon’s Echo. Due to the Echo launch, Ubi has all but disappeared.</p><p>WSJ report says that many startup founders claimed that after Amazon launched rival products their businesses collapsed. Some say they were being forced to downsize their companies due to Amazon’s competition.</p><p>Amazon has refused to comment on the predatory nature of its venture capital fund. Amazon says that such funding meetings are confidential in nature. Amazon, however, added that information obtained from such meetings is not used to build competing products, noting that any such claims are typically resolved in court.</p><p>“For 26 years, we’ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon’s,” an Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. “Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.”</p><p>While court decisions may take a long time and many of these startups are too small to fight with a giant like Amazon armed with a battery of A-list lawyers, it is answerable to the US anti-trust body which it will be facing next week. The Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos will have to testify in the official hearing scheduled for Monday in front of the House Judiciary Committee.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p> The WTTC, a council that represents private-sector travel and tourism, created the Safe Travels stamp to allow tourists to identify destinations and businesses around the world that have adopted the global standardised health and hygiene protocols.</p> 
<p>The stamp provides guidance to travel providers and travellers about the new approach to health, hygiene, deep cleansing and physical distancing, in the “new normal” of a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
<p> The protocols were devised following the experience of WTTC members dealing with Covid-19 and based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and control.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.unwto.org/">The United Nations World Tourism Organisation</a> has welcomed the WTTC Safe Travels stamp, which makes the safety and hygiene of travellers a top priority.</p> 

<p>“As we reopen Dubai’s doors to tourism and welcome our international visitors back to the city, our foremost priority is their well-being, achieved through stringent hygiene and safety protocols that have been deployed across all tourist touch points,” Helal Saeed Almarri, director general, Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism) said. </p>

<p>“The WTTC's Safe Travels stamp endorses Dubai’s strong global co-operation in combating the pandemic with comprehensive and effective measures to ensure guest health and safety.</p>
<p> “We trust that our efforts not only provide an optimised experience for our visitors, but also secure their health and that of their families, further cementing the confidence that our guests have had thus far in Dubai, and encouraging people from every corner of the world to visit one of the safest cities in the world this summer.”</p> 
 
<p>The UAE has been praised for its coronavirus response. A survey by the Deep Knowledge Group, a consortium of technology companies and non-profit organisations, last month ranked the Emirates as 11th on the list in its responses to the pandemic.</p> 
<p>Costa Rica, Indonesia, Rwanda, Tobago and Tanzania are also among the latest recipients of the health and safety stamp.</p> 
<p>The growing list of endorsements has come from many major holiday and city destinations around the world, such as Sharjah as well Malaga in Spain, which joins the growing list of Spanish destinations including Alicante and Benidorm.</p> 
<p>Gloria Guevara, WTTC president and chief executive, said: “Our Safe Travels stamp is proving a great success and we are delighted to see even more popular countries and destinations adopt our global health and hygiene protocols.</p>

<p>“The success of the WTTC Safe Travels stamp shows its importance not only to countries and destinations, but also crucially to travellers and the 330 million people around the world who work in and depend on the travel and tourism sector.</p> 
<p>“The stamp is a critical step in re-establishing consumer confidence in travel and tourism and ensuring travellers can rest easy knowing that enhanced standards of hygiene are in place and they can once again experience ‘safe travels’.”</p>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>IPv6 is coming, but we still have to use IPv4 also. In other words, we have to keep use IPv4/IPv6 dual stack environment. Also, ISPs use different aggregators for IPv4 and IPv6 (For example, PPPoE for IPv4, IPoE for IPv6). And their capacity and performance are different. As a result, connections speed of  IPv4 and IPv6 are different.</p>



<p>I’ll talk the statistics of this player at next APNIC conference (IPv6 deployment session). Please play the videos.</p>



<h2>IPv4 IPv6 Multi Protocol Media Player</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.kosho.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/46mplayer.png" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Speed comparison</h3>



<p>The player downloads media chunks by IPv4 and IPv6 (e.g. media001.ts by IPv4, media002.ts by IPv6, media003.ts by IPv4, media004.ts by IPv6 …) and calculate the download speeds. </p>



<h3>Protocol selection</h3>



<p>After the comparison, the player use the faster protocol. There are 2 modes:</p>



<ul><li>Initial check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player keeps using the faster protocol.</li></ul></li><li>Continuous check mode<ul><li>The player compares the protocols during the first segments. After that, the player uses both protocols by the following rate (e.g.) to get the latest speeds.<ul><li>faster protocol: 4</li><li>slower protocol: 1</li></ul></li><li>The reason of this mode: media streaming could keep long (For example TV streaming would continue to be watched for several hours).

              <p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular—and recognized tools when it comes to image processing for image and video annotation projects.<br></p><p>Image processing is one of the main reasons why computer vision continues to improve and drive innovative AI-based technologies. From self-driving cars to facial recognition technology—computer vision applications are the face of new tech. <br></p><p>But image processing can’t be as simple as drawing rectangles around objects—right? How do bounding boxes work, and what are the key elements that make this such a useful tool for annotators looking to create reliable datasets?</p><h2 id="bounding-box-image-processing-what-you-need-to-know">Bounding Box Image Processing: What You Need to Know</h2><p>A bounding box is an imaginary rectangle that serves as a point of reference for object detection and creates a collision box for that object. <br></p><p>Data annotators draw these rectangles over images, outlining the object of interest within each image by defining its X and Y coordinates. This makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to find what they’re looking for, determine collision paths, and conserves valuable computing resources. <br></p><p>Bounding boxes are one of the most popular image annotation techniques in deep learning. Compared to other image processing methods, this method can reduce costs and increase annotation efficiency.</p><h2 id="using-bounding-boxes-for-object-detection">Using Bounding Boxes for Object Detection</h2><p>But how does object detection work in relation to bounding boxes? Answering this question requires looking at object detection as two components: object classification and object localization. In other words, to detect an object in an image, the computer needs to know what it is and where it is. <br></p><p>Take self-driving cars as an example. An annotator will draw bounding boxes around other vehicles and label them. This helps train an algorithm to understand what vehicles look like. Annotating objects such as vehicles, traffic signals, and pedestrians makes it possible for autonomous vehicles to maneuver busy streets safely. Self-driving car perception models rely heavily on bounding boxes to make this possible.<br></p><p>However, it’s important to note that a single bounding box doesn’t guarantee a perfect prediction rate. Enhanced object detection requires many bounding boxes in combination with data augmentation techniques.</p><h2 id="common-use-cases-for-bounding-boxes">Common Use Cases for Bounding Boxes</h2><p>There are a variety of use cases for image processing and bounding boxes. Some of the more popular ones include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/autonomous-vehicle.php">Self-driving cars</a></li><li>Insurance claims</li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/retail.php">Ecommerce</a></li><li><a href="https://keymakr.com/agriculture.php">Agriculture</a></li><li>Healthcare<br></li></ul><p>Bounding boxes are used in all of these areas to train algorithms to identify patterns. An insurance company may leverage machine learning to document insurance claims for car accidents, while an agriculture company could use it to identify what stage of growth a plant is in.</p><h2 id="professional-bounding-box-annotation-services">Professional Bounding Box Annotation Services</h2><p>For those of us working in the AI industry, you may be familiar with the phrase “garbage in, garbage out.” This is spot-on. Feeding your system inaccurate training datasets is one of the best ways to sabotage your next computer vision project. <br></p><p>Misaligned bounding boxes throw a wrench in your algorithm and can take significant time to diagnose and fix. That’s why AI companies often choose to <a href="https://keymakr.com/blog/reasons-to-outsource-image-and-video-annotation/">outsource image and video annotation</a> to professional annotators.

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxford dictionary</a>, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main fundamentals for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>
<h2 id="why-learning">Why Learning?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/learn-good.jpg" alt="There is only good in learning">
</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge workers</a>: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a> too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-deep-do-you-want-to-go">How Deep Do You Want to Go?</h2>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreyfus model of competence</a> can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nzADdV6zk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose your destiny</a>, depending on your needs!</p>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/learning-not-playing.jpg" alt="You need to prepare your environment to learn efficiently">
</picture>



<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you need …</p></section></article></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/new-grad-advice/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people ask me why I chose not to pursue a PhD directly after college. I figured I might as well centralize my thoughts in one place. This essay is for computer science or technical grads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interested in machine learning</li>
<li>Enjoy working on hard, unsolved technical challenges</li>
<li>Possibly choosing between research or industry</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who deeply enjoys thinking about and coding solutions to open-ended research questions, I genuinely considered going to a PhD program. To come to a decision, I spent a while pondering why many students with research experience don’t pursue a PhD directly after undergrad. I think there are many reasons why people don’t go directly to PhD programs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Effort</em>: it’s a lot of work to write applications for many schools, get solid recommendation letters, pay a lot of money in application fees, go through interviews, align with professors, secure funding, and more.</li>
<li><em>Comfort</em>: industry perks and salaries can be more attractive than graduate school stipends and long work hours.</li>
<li><em>Inertia</em>: if you’re not absolutely sure it’s right for you, the thought of switching trajectories midway into the program is very anxiety-provoking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I felt like I could put in the effort to apply and would enjoy a PhD program if I got in, but I still didn’t know what to do. Delaying the decision didn’t feel optimal either, since even if I worked in industry for a few years before going to a PhD program, I didn’t think I’d easily accustom to a large pay cut and working on problem sets again. Understandably, the PhD vs Industry decision caused me a lot of stress! Halfway through my senior year, I wrote down some pros and cons for each choice. In practice, an industry job for me meant working at a startup since I didn’t really enjoy my engineering internships at large companies. </p>
<p>Here, I discuss the raw pros and cons of pursuing a PhD and pros and cons of joining an early-stage machine learning startup. I wrote these in my journal in January 2019, and I provide some relevant commentary from my current self as a machine learning engineer (July 2020) in the nested bullets.</p>
<h2>Pros of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can prioritize my curiosity and have the freedom to learn about what I find intellectually engaging.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I’ve been at a startup, although I can still be curious about many things, I have to work on things that provide business value. The ability to not be constrained by industry value is a real pro here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can deeply hone technical expertise and have many people respect me for it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m cringing at how much external validation I used to seek. Being in computer science is playing the <a href="https://nav.al/long-term">long game</a>. You don’t always get external validation, and good work can take a while.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s easier to “be my own boss” if I were doing research.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe? Ask a researcher this question. But <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/">choosing what to work on is challenging</a>, regardless of whether you’re in research or engineering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I actually really enjoy research more than engineering.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes I still feel that I enjoy research more than engineering, but I’ve committed to developing my engineering skills. Again, being in tech is playing the long game, and having good engineering skills will help me no matter where I go, whether it’s research or IC or management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There are more clear mentorship opportunities for me.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true if I went to a PhD program, since I’d have access to many professors and older grad student friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can be in a stable career option (5-6 years at least if doing PhD).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This point occasionally gives me anxiety, since I don’t know exactly where I am going to be for the next 5-6 years. Startups are risky. But I’ve gotten more used to this feeling over the past year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of pursuing a PhD (immediately after graduating)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Maybe I’m a shitty researcher or will find out that I’m a shitty researcher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Still a fear of mine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It’s unclear whether I want to end up in academia or industry research, so a PhD could be for nothing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my math PhD friends explains a PhD as “a socially acceptable reason for screwing around with whatever you’re interested in.” I like this reference, so technically going to a PhD program isn’t a waste if I enjoy it in the process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Incentives in academia are horrible. There are so many major conferences. How do you balance long term gains with getting the publications out?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is really true. A year ago, I didn’t know how to think long-term. I probably would have tried to maximize my number of papers and burned out in my 3rd year, complaining that I’m not working on anything truly impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A PhD can be really long and hard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love Philip Guo’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind"><em>The PhD Grind</em></a>. Unfortunately he recently took his website down, which hosted the book.</li>

<h2>Pros of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I can learn how to build things from scratch.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Painfully true — building from scratch is challenging, but the growing pains are necessary to deeply understand productionizing ML. </li>
<li>At the time, I didn’t know about the existence of “real-world” ML and engineering tools such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. These tools are super relevant and learning them can be its own pro.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can see how research is applied in industry and measure the gap between research and industry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This gap is larger than I expected. It’s also really fun to apply state-of-the-art research to business cases. For example, we recently productionized a transformer model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can gain leadership skills from the beginning and be a key figure in recruiting and defining the culture.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I was thrown into the fire as soon as I joined. Now, a year later, I’ve probably done over a hundred technical interviews, led a few ML projects for key clients, and mentored a couple of interns. I would definitely not have gotten this experience at a larger company.</li>
<li>It’s also cool to be able to choose who you work with (to some extent) by hiring people that fit in with the culture you help to define.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I can closely work with both experienced engineers and non-technical domain experts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned so much from every single one of my coworkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I am relatively immune to any level of risk this early in my career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This honestly just speaks to my insane privileges of graduating from a top school, having experience at big tech companies, and being a US citizen. I am quite thankful for these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of joining an ML startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Possibly being the only woman, potentially for a long time.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bleh. True. No comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This is not the route to maximize expected earnings. I could get paid more at a larger company. Only in the small chance that the startup succeeds will I make a lot of money.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>True, but I now feel like this really isn’t a priority for me. Being in tech gives me the privilege of making a high salary wherever I go, and I think that <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">as long as I can live comfortably</a> (as I do now), I’m happy. Maybe this will change if I’m trying to buy a house or have a family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>My technical accomplishments aren’t seen outside the startup.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat false. I think there are some people outside my company who respect my technical abilities.</li>
<li>This point also doesn’t really matter too much, since<a href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/"> one’s career involves more than just how prolific of a programmer they are.</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I could be overworking myself.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is true of any job. There are always opportunities to work more than you’re expected to. Also, as a new grad, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-mistakes-which-software-engineers-make-in-their-early-years/answer/Edmond-Lau">optimizing for learning rate</a> can feel like overworking oneself, especially in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>If I don’t care about the specific application, I might not be motivated to do quality work.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t care too much about cars (my company’s application), but I am really, really motivated to solve the technical challenges my company faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>My story and decision-making process<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Thinking back to the fall of 2018, I remember how stressed I felt drafting my statement of purpose. I’m the kind of person who’s never fully confident in my decisions — there’s always a nagging <em>what if?</em> in my brain. I didn’t feel a magnetic pull towards academia. I also didn’t feel like I was destined to make a huge impact in industry. What does one pursue if they’re just…unsure? I felt this urge to apply to PhD programs — after all, I grew up in a college town, I’m a professor’s daughter, and most of my closest childhood and university friends are in PhD programs.</p>
<p>One of my older friends told me, “If you know what problem you want to solve, then find the place where you’re most likely to help devise a solution.”  <em>Robustness in machine learning models is something only academics are working on</em>, I naively thought at the time. So maybe a PhD was the right move. But as I drafted my statement of purpose, writing about how we needed to construct and solve relevant toy problems because it would be imperative to have safe and robust machine learning models in the real world, it seemed silly to me that I wanted to research this field when I had never actually worked on machine learning in the real world.  What new perspectives could I bring? Why should a school accept me?</p>
<p>My wonderful undergraduate advisor, <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/">Pat Hanrahan</a>, urged me to consider working in industry for a couple years before going to a PhD program. I didn’t like the suggestion at first — what if I would never end up doing a PhD? “Well, then you’ve saved yourself five or six years! If you don’t want to do a PhD, you’ll find out eventually,” he laughed. </p>
<p>Pat had a point, so I started to look for industry machine learning jobs. Fortunately, since I had significant ML research experience for an undergrad, I could pick between many options. Did I want to do machine learning at a large company? Small company? Focus on a specific vertical?  I thought back to my machine learning project at Facebook, where I wrote a few lines of SQL to use a well-oiled tool called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> to set up a gradient boosting classifier. I thought about machine learning at Google, where engineers write <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a> scripts to throw lots of serialized data at one of many models in a zoo.

<p><strong>Die Corona-Warn-App funktioniert nach Recherchen von </strong><strong><em>tagesschau.de</em></strong><strong> auf vielen iPhones nur fehlerhaft. Besitzer werden oft zu spät gewarnt. Die Entwickler räumten das Problem ein - und sehen den Fehler bei Apple. </strong></p>
<p><em>Von Dominik Lauck, tagesschau.de</em></p>
<p> Fünf Wochen nach dem Start der Corona-Warn-App sind Probleme bei der Nutzung bekannt geworden. Nach Recherchen von <em>tagesschau.de</em> funktioniert auf vielen iPhones die Kontaktüberprüfung nur lückenhaft. Nutzerinnen und Nutzer wurden teilweise über Wochen nicht über die App informiert, ob sie Kontakt zu Infizierten hatten oder nicht. SAP, das die App zusammen mit der Deutschen Telekom entwickelt hat, räumte den Fehler ein.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<p> "Da gibt es Probleme, und ich hoffe ganz stark, dass die entweder sehr, sehr schnell beseitigt werden oder wir einen wirksamen Workaround finden, (…) um trotzdem die Funktionalität auf die Beine zu stellen", sagt Thomas Klingbeil, der Software-Architekt der Corona-Warn-App bei SAP gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>.</p>
<h2>Hintergrundaktualisierung wird nicht aufgerufen</h2>
<p> Woran hakt es? Auch wenn die Corona-Warn-App nicht geöffnet ist, soll sie im Hintergrund weiterlaufen und Daten aktualisieren. Wenn es eine Begegnung mit einer Person gab, die dann positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wurde, soll das Handy den Besitzer eigentlich aktiv mit einer Benachrichtigung auf das erhöhte Risiko hinweisen. "Das Problem, das wir haben, ist, dass die Hintergrundaktualisierung vom Betriebssystem offenbar nicht aufgerufen wird", so Klingbeil.</p><!-- mediaCon-->
<p> Zuvor hatte die "Bild"-Zeitung bereits über ähnliche Probleme bei einigen Android-Geräten berichtet. Dort war die Hintergrundaktualisierung im Stromsparmodus nicht oder nur eingeschränkt möglich. "Das gilt nicht nur für die Corona-Warn-App, sondern für alle Apps auf diesen Smartphones", hieß es dazu aus dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium. Laut Entwickler ist das keine Fehlfunktion in der App, sondern hängt mit den Einstellungen bei den Geräten zusammen. Dies könne von den Nutzern geändert werden.</p>
<p> Das Gesundheitsministerium versicherte, dass die Anwendung "zu jeder Zeit" funktioniert habe. Wer seine Einstellung nicht anpasste, wurde erst beim Öffnen der App vor einem möglichen gefährlichen Kontakt mit einem Corona-Infizierten gewarnt. "Mit der Version 1.1.1, die am Mittwoch erschienen ist, können die Nutzerinnen und Nutzern, diese fehlerhaften Optimierungsfunktionen des Betriebssystems übersteuern", erklärte Jürgen Müller aus dem SAP-Vorstand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-und-sie-funktioniert-doch-juergen-mueller">in einem Blogeintrag</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem bei iPhones noch nicht behoben</h2>
<p> Anders als bei den Android-Geräten ist bei den iPhones das Problem noch nicht behoben. Einige Nutzer berichten gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>, dass an mehr als zehn aufeinanderfolgenden Tagen kein Abgleich erfolgte. Das heißt, sie wären im Extremfall erst zehn Tage später gewarnt worden, dass sie Kontakt mit Infizierten gehabt hatten.</p>
<p> Normalerweise werden die Daten in der App alle 24 Stunden aktualisiert. Wann genau steht unter dem Punkt "Risikoermittlung" beziehungsweise in den Einstellungen des Smartphones. Pro Tag sollen bis zu 14 Datensätze abgerufen werden - einen für jeden der zurückliegenden 14 Tage. "Wenn die App in den letzten zwei Wochen dauerhaft aktiv war, sollten Sie in der Regel 13 oder 14 Überprüfungen in den letzten 24 Stunden sehen", erklären die Entwickler. Die Zahl der abgerufenen Datensätze sagt nichts darüber aus, ob oder wieviele Kontakte die App mit anderen Corona-Warn-Apps ermittelt hat.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Fehler liegt im Betriebssystem von Apple</h2>
<p> Die Entwickler haben Apple über die Lücken bei der Kontaktüberprüfung informiert, der iPhone-Hersteller habe den Fehler mittlerweile eingeräumt. Nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen befindet sich im Betriebssystem iOS ein Bug. Dort ist ein sogenannter Scheduler einprogrammiert, der dafür sorgt, dass die Corona-Warn-App im Hintergrund die Daten einmal täglich vom Server holt.</p>
<p> "Wir sind vollkommen auf ein regelmäßiges Funktionieren des Schedulers angewiesen", erklärt Peter Lorenz, Chefentwickler der Deutschen Telekom, gegenüber <em>tagesschau.de</em>. "Dieser Scheduler hat hin und wieder einen Schluckauf." Dadurch unterbleibe der Impuls, die Daten vom Server abzurufen.</p>
<!-- infobox -->
<h2>Ministerium räumt Fehler ein</h2>
<p> Das Problem haben die Entwickler nach eigenen Aussagen "vor einer Woche" bemerkt. Auch in der Schweiz, Österreich und Italien hätten die Programmierer der dortigen Corona-Apps entsprechende Probleme festgestellt. "Uns war nicht bekannt, in welcher Breite das Problem auftritt", so Lorenz.</p>
<p> Das Ausmaß sei erst an diesem Freitag erkannt worden, als sich die Entwickler nach den Berichten über die Android-Fehler auch das Apple-Betriebssystem genauer angeschaut hätten. "Die Entwickler arbeiten mit Hochdruck an einem Weg, die systembedingten Einschränkungen zu umgehen, bis Apple das Systemproblem selbst gelöst hat", erklärte das Gesundheitsministerium auf Anfrage. SAP-Sprecher Hilmar Schepp zeigte sich zuversichtlich, "bis Anfang der kommenden Woche" eine vorübergehende Lösung zu haben, den Bug zu umgehen.</p>
<h2>Codes werden weiterhin ausgetauscht</h2>
<p> Sowohl bei den Android- als auch bei den Apple-Smartphones würden jedoch auch ohne die Hintergrundaktualisierung anonyme Codes mit anderen Smartphones ausgetauscht, versichern die Entwickler. Allerdings wird ein Nutzer bei fehlender Hintergrundaktualisierung nur dann über ein Ansteckungsrisiko informiert, wenn er die App öffnet.</p>
<p> Wie viele Geräte von den Problemen betroffen sind, ist nicht bekannt. Insgesamt wurde die App in Deutschland bereits 16,2 Millionen Mal heruntergeladen. Noch am Nachmittag hatte das Gesundheitsministerium erklärt, das Problem mit der aussetzenden Hintergrundaktualisierung sei bei iPhones nicht aufgetreten. "Im Moment können wir sagen, dass es nicht alle Androidgeräte betroffen hat, sondern nur bestimmte", sagte eine Sprecherin.</p><div>
<div>
<!-- mediaCon-->
<h4>So können Sie die Kontaktüberprüfung abrufen</h4>
<div><p>In den Einstellungen Ihres Smartphones können Sie sehen, ob die Kontaktüberprüfung der Corona-Warn-App reibungslos funktioniert oder Lücken aufweist. Dazu sind folgende Schritte nötig:</p><p><strong>iPhone:</strong> <br>Einstellungen -&gt; Datenschutz -&gt; Health -&gt; COVID-19-Kontaktprotokoll -&gt; Kontaktüberprüfungen </p><p><strong>Android-Geräte: </strong><br>Einstellungen -&gt; Google -&gt; COVID-19-Benachrichtigungen an</p></div>

</div>

<h2>App soll Infektionsketten unterbrechen</h2>
<p> Die Corona-Warn-App wurde <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-warn-app-startet-101.html">am 16. Juni veröffentlicht</a> und ist in den Stores <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.rki.coronawarnapp">von Google</a> und <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/corona-warn-app/id1512595757">Apple</a> erhältlich. Sie soll helfen, Infektionsketten nachzuverfolgen und zu unterbrechen. Außerdem kann sie dazu beitragen, dass Menschen nach einem Coronavirus-Test möglichst schnell ihr Testergebnis digital erhalten und über die App anonym mögliche Kontaktpersonen warnen können, wenn diese auch die App installiert haben.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259084270854905856">link</a> after <a href="https://www.longevity.vc/">link</a> after <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15174-3">link</a> after <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/researchers-able-to-improve-reverse-age-related-diseases-in-mice/">link</a> on the topic.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Six years ago, a lifetime in the aging field, the mere suggestion that aging could be reversed was enough to have your colleagues &amp; donors screw up their noses.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<p><em>Work-in-progress LVGL GUI Framework ported to Wayland EGL on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch</em></p>
<p><strong>We ❤️ &nbsp; Old Underwear...</strong></p>
<p>They feel comfy, they fit our contours. Nevermind the holes and the old stains 🤢</p>
<p><strong>X11 is like Old Underwear.</strong> It's been around for 30 years... Yet we still use it in spite of its feature gaps and wonky quirks.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/PinePhone"><strong>PinePhone on Ubuntu Touch feels like... New Underwear.</strong></a></p>
<p>It runs Linux but it has none of the legacy X11 code. Because it's optimised for a great mobile experience with <strong>Wayland.</strong></p>
<p>But New Underwear feels uncomfortable. So today we'll learn Wayland and understand how apps are built with Wayland.</p>
<p>Hopefully someday we'll move on to newer, simpler app frameworks (like <a href="https://lvgl.io/">LVGL</a> and Flutter) as we discard our Old Underwear: X11, SDL, GTK, Qt, ...</p>
<p>The source code for this article may be found here...</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X11</a> is the Graphical Display Service that runs on most Linux desktops and notebooks.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the X11 Service on Pinebook Pro...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-pinebook.png" alt="X11 Service on Pinebook Pro"></p>
<p>That's the X11 Service... A <strong>2.2 MB</strong> executable named <strong><code>Xorg</code></strong>. </p>
<p>The X11 Service controls the rendering of Linux apps (as well as the keyboard and mouse input) like this...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-x11.png" alt="X11 Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the Linux programs running on our Linux machine: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Each program renders its graphical display and transmits the raw graphics to the X11 Service (via a local TCP socket).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X11 Service forwards the rendered graphics to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager"><strong>Window Manager / Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor is provided by the <strong>Desktop Environment</strong>: Xfce, KDE, Gnome, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor wraps the rendered graphics into Display Windows and <strong>"decorates"</strong> them with scrollbars, title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons.</p>
<p>The Window Manager / Compositor then draws the Display Windows into a <strong>Screen Buffer</strong> according to their screen coordinates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Screen Buffer is rendered to our screen by the X11 Service, talking to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>keyboard and mouse input</strong> is captured by the X11 Service, and forwarded to the programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why is X11 so complex? So many hops?</em></p>
<p>Because X11 was designed for Distributed Computing Systems.</p>
<p>Here's how I used (abused?) X11R4 at <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/">UIUC Systems Research Group</a> way back in 1990 (30 years ago!)...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-uiuc.png" alt="Distributed X11 System"></p>
<p>Thankfully things are a lot simpler now, lemme explain...</p>

<p><em>Do we need overlapping or tiled windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we need to need to decorate PinePhone windows with a title bar and minimise / maximise / close buttons?</em></p>
<p><em>Do we even need any windows on PinePhone?</em></p>
<p>No! Because each PinePhone app takes control of the entire screen!</p>
<p>PinePhone uses a simpler Graphical Display Service: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Wayland_compositors"><strong>Wayland Compositor</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let's hunt for the Wayland Compositor on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-compositor.png" alt="Wayland Compositor on PinePhone"></p>
<p>That's the Wayland Compositor... A <strong>262 KB</strong> executable named <code>unity-system-compositor</code>. </p>
<p><em>Compare that with the 2.2 MB X11 Server on Pinebook Pro!</em></p>
<p>Here's how the Wayland Compositor controls apps and touchscreen input on PinePhone with Ubuntu Touch...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-arch.png" alt="Wayland Architecture"></p>
<p>(Adapted from <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html">"Wayland Architecture"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)">"EGL API"</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top we have the apps running on our phone: <strong>Terminal, Editor, Web Browser</strong>.</p>
<p>Since each app runs fullscreen, only the active app will be rendered.</p>
<p>When then app starts, it queries the <strong>Wayland Compositor</strong> for the graphical display interfaces available. (They talk via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Socket">Linux socket file</a>: <code>/run/user/32011/wayland-0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayland Compositor returns the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)"><strong>EGL Interface</strong></a> to the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App calls the EGL Interface to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL"><strong>render OpenGL graphics</strong></a> directly to the <strong>Linux Display Driver</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux Display Driver forwards the OpenGL rendering commands to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit"><strong>GPU to update the screen</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any <strong>touchscreen input</strong> is captured by the Wayland Compositor, and forwarded to the active app.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wayland looks so much simpler and faster than X11!</p>
<p><em>Wayland is designed for OpenGL and GPUs?</em></p>
<p>Yes! And I lied about Wayland being New Underwear... Wayland is not really that New!</p>
<p>Wayland was first released in 2008 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)">11 years ago</a>)... Yet it was designed around OpenGL and GPUs, the same tech that powers our beautiful games today. (<a href="https://youtu.be/DNBk9hnPkTY">And websites too</a>)</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to render our own OpenGL graphics with Wayland and Ubuntu Touch on PinePhone...</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/wayland-egl.jpg" alt="Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone"></p>
<p><em>Rendering a yellow rectangle with Wayland and OpenGL on PinePhone</em></p>

<p>Here's the function that calls OpenGL to render the yellow box above: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L44-L60"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Render the OpenGL ES2 display
static void render_display() {
    //  Fill the rectangular region with yellow
    glClearColor(
        1.0,  //  Red
        1.0,  //  Green
        0.0,  //  Blue
        1.0   //  Alpha
    );
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Render now
    glFlush();
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>render_display()</code> looks exactly like normal OpenGL, and it works on PinePhone with Wayland! (Thanks to Ubuntu Touch)</p>
<p>Two things to note...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PinePhone supports a popular subset of OpenGL, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES"><strong>OpenGL for Embedded Systems</strong></a> Version 2.0.</p>
<p>OpenGL ES is optimised for Embedded Devices. It's used by many mobile and console games today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To render OpenGL ES graphics, we need to get the <strong>OpenGL ES Context</strong> and <strong>Window Surface</strong> from Wayland</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before calling <code>render_display()</code>, we fetch the OpenGL Window Surface from Wayland like so: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L167-L189"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Dimensions of the OpenGL region to be rendered
static int WIDTH  = 480;
static int HEIGHT = 360;

static struct wl_egl_window *egl_window;  //  Wayland EGL Window
static EGLSurface egl_surface;            //  EGL Surface

//  Create the EGL Window and render OpenGL graphics
static void create_window(void) {
    //  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
    egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
    assert(egl_window != EGL_NO_SURFACE);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window

    //  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
    egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
        egl_window, NULL);
    assert(egl_surface != NULL);  //  Failed to create OpenGL Window Surface

    //  Set the current rendering surface
    EGLBoolean madeCurrent = eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
        egl_surface, egl_context);
    assert(madeCurrent);  //  Failed to set rendering surface

    //  Render the display
    render_display();

    //  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
    EGLBoolean swappedBuffers = eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
    assert(swappedBuffers);  //  Failed to swap display buffers
}
</code></pre>
<p>Functions named <code>wl_egl_...</code> are provided by the Wayland EGL Interface.  Functions named <code>egl...</code> come from the cross-platform <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/egl.html#:%7E:text=The%20main%20library%20(%20libEGL%20)%20is,directly%20dispatched%20to%20the%20drivers.">Mesa 3D Graphics Library</a>.</p>
<p><em>EGL vs OpenGL... What's the difference?</em></p>
<p>In Wayland, EGL is the Enabler for OpenGL. </p>
<p>Wayland only understands EGL and it will gladly hand us EGL objects... But it's up to us to transform EGL into OpenGL for rendering.</p>
<p>Thus in the code above, we take a Wayland Surface <code>surface</code> and transform it into an EGL Window <code>egl_window</code>...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an EGL Window from a Wayland Surface 
egl_window = wl_egl_window_create(surface, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create an OpenGL Window Surface <code>egl_surface</code> from that EGL Window...</p>
<pre><code>//  Create an OpenGL Window Surface for rendering
egl_surface = eglCreateWindowSurface(egl_display, egl_conf,
    egl_window, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>And we begin the OpenGL rendering...</p>
<pre><code>//  Set the current rendering surface
eglMakeCurrent(egl_display, egl_surface,
    egl_surface, egl_context);

//  Render the display
render_display();

//  Swap the display buffers to make the display visible
eglSwapBuffers(egl_display, egl_surface);
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how we create a Wayland Region for OpenGL rendering: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L103-L112"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>static struct wl_region *region;  //  Wayland Region

//  Create the Wayland Region for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void create_opaque_region(void) {
    //  Create a Wayland Region
    region = wl_compositor_create_region(compositor);
    assert(region != NULL);  //  Failed to create EGL Region

    //  Set the dimensions of the Wayland Region
    wl_region_add(region, 0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

    //  Add the Region to the Wayland Surface
    wl_surface_set_opaque_region(surface, region);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about EGL, check out <a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/Wayland/EGL/">"Programming Wayland Clients"</a></p>
<p>The Wayland EGL code in this article was adapted from that document.</p>

<p>Earlier in <code>create_window()</code> we called an <strong>EGL Context</strong> <code>egl_context</code> to render OpenGL graphics.</p>
<p>Here's how we get the EGL Context: <a href="https://github.com/lupyuen/pinephone-mir/blob/master/egl.c#L113-L165"><code>pinephone-mir/egl.c</code></a></p>
<pre><code>/// Wayland EGL Interfaces for OpenGL Rendering
static EGLDisplay egl_display;  //  EGL Display
static EGLConfig  egl_conf;     //  EGL Configuration
static EGLContext egl_context;  //  EGL Context

//  Create the EGL Context for rendering OpenGL graphics
static void init_egl(void) {
    //  Attributes for our EGL Display
    EGLint config_attribs[] = {
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE,    EGL_WINDOW_BIT,
        EGL_RED_SIZE,        8,
        EGL_GREEN_SIZE,      8,
        EGL_BLUE_SIZE,       8,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
    static const EGLint context_attribs[] = {
        EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, 2,
        EGL_NONE

        <h3>
About</h3>

<p>
Mathematical Components is the name of a library of formalized mathematics for
the Coq system. It covers a variety of topics, from the theory of basic data
structures (e.g., numbers, lists, finite sets) to advanced results in various
flavors of algebra. This library constitutes the infrastructure for the machine
checked proofs of the Four Color Theorem and of the Odd Order Theorem.
</p>
<p>
The reason of existence of this book is to break down the barriers to entry.
While there are several books around covering the usage of the Coq system and
the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components library is built in an
unconventional way. As a consequence this book provides a non standard
presentation of Coq, putting upfront the formalization choices and the proof
style that are the pillars of the library.
</p>
<p>
This books targets two classes of public. On one hand newcomers, even the more
mathematical inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the programming
language of Coq, <em>Gallina</em>, and the <em>Ssreflect</em> proof language.
On the other hand accustomed Coq users find a substantial account of the
formalization style that made the Mathematical Components library possible.

<p>
	*** The Urban Archeology Program uncovered basalt slab floors corresponding to an open plaza in the Old Houses of Axayácatl, <em>tlatoani</em> of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	*** INAH’s archaeological salvage project also detected the remains of the conqueror's dwelling, which later became the headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca.</p>

 

<p>
	Within the walls of the Old Houses of Axayácatl some of the most decisive episodes of the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlán occurred, such as the death of the <em>tlatoani</em> Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, possibly on June 29, 1520; unexpected outcomes that undermined the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards and triggered the open confrontation.</p>

<p>
	The most recent discovery made by specialists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), of vestiges of that pre-Hispanic palace, and of the remains of a later house built under the orders of Hernán Cortés, with reused materials from the previous Tenochca building, revives the memory of those historical events, five centuries later.</p>

<p>
	Thanks to historical sources, it is no mystery for archaeologists that under the floors of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, one of the most emblematic buildings of Mexico City’s Historic Center, located next to the Metropolitan Cathedral, are the foundations of the Palace of Axayácatl, which functioned as the living quarters of Cortés' entourage upon their arrival in the heart of Tenochtitlan.</p>

<p>
	Over the last two decades, and taking advantage of diverse remodeling projects undertaken in the headquarters of that institution, various INAH experts have found remnants of the former residence of Moctezuma II's father. The most recent discoveries were brought to light during archaeological interventions led by Raúl Barrera Rodríguez and José María García Guerrero, head and collaborator, respectively, of the Urban Archeology Program (PAU).</p>

<p>
	Following an inspection for refurbishments conducted in the northern half of the historic building, PAU personnel carried out an archaeological salvage project between the first days of September 2017 and mid-August 2018, focusing on the main courtyard and an adjacent room. It is noteworthy that the project continues to the present in the post-dig research phase.</p>

<p>
	Excavations resulted in the discovery of numerous basalt slab floors, which must have formed part of an open plaza in the Palace of Axayácatl, the ruler who controlled the destiny of Tenochtitlan between 1469 and 1481.</p>

<p>
	Also, from the early Viceregal period (1521-1620 AD), the remains of a house built by order of Cortés were uncovered. That construction, where the Spanish conqueror resided for several years, would also become the seat of the first Cabildo of New Spain (around 1525) and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, granted to the conqueror four years later.</p>

<p>
	<strong>The archaeological investigation</strong></p>

<p>
	As an exciting part of the public outreach program "Contigo en la Distancia” (“With you from a Distance”), from the Ministry of Culture, the head of the PAU, Raúl Barrera, and his collaborator José María García, explain that they dug 12 test pits - 2 meters per side and 1.50 m deep— around the main courtyard of the National Monte de Piedad, where remodeling work was being carried out to reinforce the columns that define the structure and support the first level of the building.</p>

<p>
	By excavating a series of test pits, on the north, east and west sides, the remains of a stone masonry wall - 1.50 meters high by 1.25 m wide - were uncovered. This wall served as a foundation and basal platform for a series of columns of the building erected around 1755, which allows us to deduce that the central courtyard was originally larger. Also, in the west section of this same space were found the subflooring: basal portions and a shaft of other columns from the early Viceregal period.</p>

<p>
	However, major surprises awaited in the adjacent room. PAU archaeologists had the opportunity to conduct an extensive excavation, which allowed them to locate the remains of a room made of basalt and <em>tezontle </em>(vesicular lava) dressed stones - 5 by 4 meters -, whose base sat upon a floor of basalt slabs. Further analyses led to the conclusion that this was the home of Hernán Cortés, once Mexico-Tenochtitlan fell in 1521.</p>

<p>
	Below the subflooring of the house of Cortés, more than 3 meters deep, the remains of another floor of basalt slabs, but from pre-Hispanic times, were detected. Given its characteristics, the specialists deduced that it was part of an open space in the former Palace of Axayácatl, probably a courtyard.</p>

<p>
	Barrera and García emphasize that the vestiges of the nascent Viceregal era correspond to reused materials from the Old Houses of Axayácatl. These premises, like so many other structures of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, were destroyed by the Spanish and their indigenous allies, almost to their foundations.</p>

<p>
	As an example of this, embedded in the façade of the southeast interior corner of the colonial room, two pre-Hispanic dressed stones carved with sculptures in high relief were found. They depicted a feathered serpent (Quetzalcóatl) and a headdress of feathers, and must have belonged to a panel of the Palace of Axayácatl. Also, another Mexica sculpture with the glyph that symbolizes the <em>tianquiztli</em> or market was recovered, in its place as part of a shaft.</p>

<p>
	Some of the diagnostic materials, which allow the preliminary dating of these findings, are the remains of pre-Hispanic and colonial pottery, whose types (styles) belong to the aforementioned historical periods: Aztec III: Orange Monochrome, Black-on-Orange and Texcoco Burnished Earthenware; as well as glazed earthenware and Spanish and New Spain majolica.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Old Houses of Axayácatl</strong></p>

<p>
	Raúl Barrera, also a researcher at the INAH Directorate of Salvage Archaeology, reflects on the fact that some material evidence speaks volumes, by its very paucity. Such is the case for the recent discoveries in the National Monte de Piedad, which “speak” of the destruction that the main buildings of Tenochtitlan were subjected to, both for symbolic and practical purposes.</p>

<p>
	Despite the modest nature of the remains, those pre-Hispanic floors were the same ones that the Spanish invaders and their allies tread upon during their arrival to Tenochtitlan, on November 8, 1519. Moctezuma II allowed them to stay in the old houses that had belonged to his father, and soon after they turned them into their barracks.</p>

<p>
	While in that palace, numerous events took place. For example, they remodeled a room to celebrate mass, and right there, they also held various rulers captive, starting with their distinguished host: Moctezuma Xocoyotzin; as well as Cuitláhuac, lord of Iztapalapa; Cacamatzin,<em> tlatoani</em> of Texcoco; and Itzcuauhtzin, lord of Tlatelolco, among others.</p>

<p>
	Following on the massacre during the festival of Tóxcatl that took place at the Templo Mayor (“Great Temple”) on May 22 of 1520, by the order of Pedro de Alvarado, the Spanish withdrew and returned to the Palace of Axayácatl. That incident unleashed the anger of the Mexica and, at the end of June of that year, they besieged the invaders in that building. Hernán Cortés wanted to contain their fury through Moctezuma, who tried to placate them from the roof of the palace. But the efforts were in vain, as his brother Cuitláhuac had already been ordained the new ruler.</p>

<p>
	On the night of June 30, 1520, the Spanish fled to Tlaxcala by the great causeway of Tlacopan (today Tacuba), leaving behind the Old Houses of Axayácatl.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Cortés’ houses</strong></p>

<p>
	After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the surviving Mexicas were forced to destroy, with their own hands, their temples and palaces and build the new city using the same materials. The Old Houses of Axayácatl would gave way to the Houses of Hernán de Cortés, which were also the temporary headquarters of the first Cabildo of New Spain, around 1525, and of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca, a noble title carrying the responsibility for creating a government, granted in 1529 for his services to the Spanish Crown.</p>

<p>
	Upon the conqueror's death in 1547, his descendants retained ownership. His son Martín Cortés Zúñiga inherited the marquessate, but in 1566 he was involved in a conspiracy that sought to seize the government of New Spain, so he was expelled from the Viceroyalty. The houses and the extensive land remained in the hands of a legal representative and, already in poor condition, were sold to the Sacro Monte de Piedad in 1836.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      

<div>
  
    
      <div><p>In version 3.4, python shipped with a new module in the standard library,  <code>pathlib</code> . At the time of its release, I remember hearing some fanfare around it, but I didn’t quite understand the point of it. I had only recently stopped adding strings together to create paths to the files and folders I needed to work with, in favor of using the  <code>os</code>  and  <code>os.path</code>  modules. It took me a little while to experiment with it and plumb the documentation for useful&nbsp;bits.</p><p>Since then, I’ve learned a lot about the  <code>pathlib</code>  module, and as I have said before, <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/pathlib-my-new-favorite-module/">it is my favorite module in the standard library</a>.</p><p>While that’s the case, most people I talk to about it are working to hard to access files and folders with python. Many have either not heard about it, or they still don’t understand&nbsp;it.</p><p>They still write code like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p><span>OK</span>, so there’s nothing wrong with that code per se, but most pythonistas would agree that your code should be readable. I would argue that  <code>pathlib</code>  could make that line of code more readable<label for="readable"></label><span>One could argue that it’s not necessarily more readable, if you’re not as familiar with it. So maybe I should settle for it being shorter?</span>&nbsp;:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">BASE_FOLDER = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>I don’t know what your favorite module is in the standard library<label for="std"></label><span>Though, I would like to know what it is and why!</span> , but I imagine that most people don’t really think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>The reason why  <code>pathlib</code>  is my favorite module is that I have found it to be so very useful. And I really believe it can save you pain and effort in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>That’s why I created two resources for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The first is what I’m calling a “field guide” to  <code>pathlib</code> . It’s a standalone document, a little longer than one of my blog posts, that will introduce you to the module and some of its features I use the&nbsp;most.</p><p>I have also created a cheat sheet for the module, since there are over 40 useful properties and methods on a  <code>Path</code>  object, and I find that I could use a quick-reference guide to remind me of the ones I don’t use as&nbsp;often.</p><p>Look, I suggest the next time you are going to work with a file or folder, give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p>It combines parts of the  <code>os</code> ,  <code>os.path</code> , and  <code>glob</code>  modules (and maybe more) in one useful&nbsp;package.</p></div>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="strings-arent-good-enough">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#strings-arent-good-enough">Strings aren’t good enough</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>One of the things I love about  <code>pathlib</code>  is that you are now working with an object instead of a&nbsp;string.</p><p>Strings are not the best way to work with data. You can’t ask a string what the name of the file is. Instead, you’ll have to come up with method to break the string apart and harvest that&nbsp;information.</p><p>One way to do that would be to use the  <code>basename</code>  method in the  <code>os.path</code>  module and split the&nbsp;result:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = '/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html'
file_name = os.path.basename(location).split('.')[0]</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>That works, but it’s not the most readable. You have to do some mental gymnastics to unpack the four different things that happen in that one line of code. It could be challenging for people who are new to&nbsp;python.</p><p>Instead, you could use a  <code>Path</code>  object:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">location = Path('/Users/chris/field_guides/pathlib.html')
file_name = location.stem</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Now, this is what I’m talking about! There’s no mental gymnastics to figure out how to split strings. There’s no having to remember what individual  <code>os.path</code>  methods do. It’s just simply asking an object what one of its properties&nbsp;are.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="express-yourself">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#express-yourself">Express yourself</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Since it frees me from directly manipulating strings, I find that  <code>pathlib</code>  allows me to be more expressive with the way I write code that interacts with files and&nbsp;folders.</p><p>I write less code, and my mind feels more able to think about the problem at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>For instance, you can easily reference all of the  <code>json</code>  files in the current&nbsp;folder:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>You can even safely open a file, load its contents, and close it in one&nbsp;line:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">json_files = Path().glob('*.json')
for f in json_files:
    data = json.loads(f.read_text())</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>Even manipulating paths are easier with&nbsp;pathlib.</p><p>I see many people joining paths by adding strings together, like&nbsp;this:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># not the best way to manipulate a path
root_folder = 'path/to/content/folder'
config_file = root_folder + 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this can work, it’s not the best way to manipulate paths, as this way will break if you ever run your code on a different operating system, as Windows uses back-slashes to denote paths. All other platforms use&nbsp;slashes.</p><p>Also, it’s easy to introduce bugs like I did in that code. I didn’t include a trailing slash in the  <code>root_folder</code>  variable. So the resulting path would look like this, and would probably&nbsp;fail:</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current"># result of previous code
'path/to/content/folderconfig/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>The next best way to join paths is to use the  <code>os.path.joinpath</code>  method. This will handle the “bug” I introduced&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = os.path.join(root_folder, 'config/config.json')
print(config_file)
'path/to/content/folder/config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <div><p>While this is better, it still doesn’t address the cross-platform&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Thankfully,  <code>pathlib</code>  not only makes it even easier to join paths, but it also allow you to write code that works on every operating&nbsp;system.</p></div>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">root_folder = Path('path/to/content/folder')
config_file = root_folder.joinpath('config/config.json')</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p>Additionally,  <code>pathlib</code>  gives you the option to write less code when joining paths. This is equivalent to the line&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">config_file = root_folder / 'config/config.json'</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <h2 id="its-your-turn">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/#its-your-turn">It’s your turn</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <div><p>Look, you seriously should give  <code>pathlib</code>  a&nbsp;try.</p><p><a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/resources/">Download my field guide</a>. Use it to get a basic understanding of how to use the  <code>Path</code>  object. Practice accessing files with it. Then, come back and download my cheat sheet, so you can better remember what attributes are at your disposal and be reminded of the ones you haven’t tried&nbsp;yet.</p><p>I’m confident you’ll enjoy working with files and folders more than you do&nbsp;now.</p><p>And also, let me know how you would improve these&nbsp;resources.</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you!</p></div>

<![CDATA[Bloom filters debunked: Dispelling 30 Years of bad math with Coq]]>

July 24, 2020 | https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org5efdc67">
<p>
There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as
<b>Firefox</b> or <b>Chrome</b>) where the browser will automatically warn the
user if they happen to navigate to a "<i>malicious</i>" URL:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png" alt="malicious-site.png">
</p> 


<p>
While <i>conceptually</i> simple, this feature actually requires more
engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the
set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be
somewhat difficult.
</p>

<p>
This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of <i>all</i>
known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain <i>millions and
millions</i> of entries, is something that is just practically
infeasible for most users. </p><p><img src="https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png" alt="database_local.png"> </p>


<p>
Conversely, sending <i>every</i> URL that a user visits to some external
service, where it could be <i>logged</i> and <i>data-mined</i> by nefarious
third parties, is something that most users should
probably not be comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by
means of a rather interesting <i>compromise</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Using a probabilistic data structure known as a <b>Bloom filter</b>,
Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known
malicious URLs locally.  By querying this <i>space-efficient</i> local set,
browsers will only send up a <i>small proportion</i> of the honest URLs.
</p>

<p><b><i>Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database</i>.</b>
</p>


<p>
This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of
users ever day, depends on <b>two key properties</b> of Bloom filters:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>No false negatives</dt><dd>This states that if a query for an URL in the
Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be
guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e
<i>the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for
all known malicious URLs</i>.</dd>

<dt>Low false positive rate</dt><dd>This property states that for any URL
that is <i>not in the set of malicious</i> URLs, the likelihood of a
Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be <i>fairly
low</i> - thus minimising the number of <i>unnecessary</i> infractions on
user privacy.</dd>
</dl>


<p>
This mechanism works <i>quite</i> well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter
seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has
one small problem, and that is:
</p>

<p><b><i>The</i> widely cited expression <i>for the</i> false positive rate <i>of a bloom filter is</i> wrong!</b>
</p>


<p>
In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have
actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention,
requiring <i>multiple</i> corrections and even <i>corrections of these
corrections</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our
understanding of a Bloom filter at all?</b>
</p>

<p>
Well, <i>never fear</i>, I am writing this post to inform you that we have
just recently used <code>Coq</code> to produce the <i>very first</i> <b>certified</b> proof
of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to
this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) to a
mechanism that countless people rely on <i>every single</i> day.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this
research, answering the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a Bloom filter?</li>
<li>Why did these errors initially arise?</li>
<li>What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>If your an engineer you probably spend a lot of time using a terminal.
Some of your best productivity gains will come from understanding it better and making small improvements to repetitive tasks.</p><p>Many people know the basics for default shell shortcuts like Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e to go to the begining and end of a line.
There are also a few keyboard shortcuts you’ve probably found by accident like Ctrl+s, Ctrl+z, or Ctrl+c.</p><p>Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use regularly that you might find helpful too.
I’m focusing on zsh because that’s my preferred interactive shell but many of these shortcuts will work in bash or other shells too.</p><p>If you want more shell tips, check out my mastering zsh workshop <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh">https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with some basic keyboard shortcuts and get progressivly more advanced.
Many of these shortcuts are default behavior but some will need code added to your configuration to enable them.</p><h3 id="basics">Basics</h3><p>I’m amazed how long it took me to learn these keybord shortcuts and see that people still don’t know them.</p><p><code>Ctrl+r</code>: Reverse search through your command history.
Kinda like pushing the up arrow with search.</p><p><code>Ctrl+c</code>: kill/interupt the current running process.
If you don’t want it to print <code>^C</code> every time you press it you can add <code>set echo-control-characters Off</code> to your <code>~/.inputrc</code> file.</p><p><code>Ctrl+d</code>: Close your current terminal.
Same as typing <code>exit</code> but way shorter.</p><p><code>Ctrl+l</code>: clear the screen.
Similar, but slightly different, to typing <code>clear</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+z</code>: Suspend process.
This is really helpful if you’re in your editor and you need to run a command real quick.
Instead of opening a new terminal press <code>ctrl+z</code>, run your command, and then type <code>fg</code> to bring the command back to the foreground.</p><h3 id="delete-word-behind-your-cursor">Delete word behind your cursor</h3><p>If you have a command typed out or selected from your history with Ctrl+r you probably want to change one or two words from it.</p><p>First you can move your cursor back a word with <code>Alt+b</code>.
Press it multiple times to keep moving back.</p><p>Once your cursor is at the end of the word you need to change/delete press <code>Ctrl+w</code> to delete it.
If it doesn’t delete up to the characters you expect try setting your <code>$WORDCHARS</code> variable to characters that should be considered part of the word.</p><h3 id="don-t-repeat-your-whole-arguments">Don’t repeat your whole arguments</h3><p>If you need to move a file to something like a $FILE.bak you can do that easily with <code>{,}</code>.</p><p>Don’t do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt.bak
</code></pre><p>Do this</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/my-long-file/name.txt{,.bak}
</code></pre><p>It works anywhere in the command too!
This will copy name.txt into new-folder (assuming it exists).</p><pre><code>cp ~/this-is/{my-long-file,new-folder}/name.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="enter-last-argument-from-previous-command-s">Enter last argument from previous command(s)</h3><p>There is a default shell variable <code>$?</code> which represents the last argument from the preceeding command (e.g. <code>echo $?</code>)
<code>Ctrl+.</code> is the keyboard shortcut to do the same thing.
Not only is it easier to type but you can push it multiple times to cycle through the last argument from previous commands.</p><h3 id="prepend-sudo">Prepend sudo</h3><p>I need this a lot.
You type out a command or find it from your history and need to run it with sudo but forgot it at the begining of the line.
Normally you would <code>Ctrl+a</code> type <code>sudo</code> then <code>Ctrl+e</code>.
This shortcuts does all that with a single shortcut.</p><p>Add this code snippet to your .zshrc
I prefer <code>esc, s</code> for the keyboard shortcut because it works well in vim mode and doesn’t clobber the default <code>Ctrl+s</code> shortcut.</p><pre><code># add sudo before command with esc, s
function prepend-sudo() {
  [[ -z $BUFFER ]] &amp;&amp; zle up-history
  if [[ $BUFFER == sudo\ * ]]; then
    LBUFFER="${LBUFFER#sudo }"
  else
    LBUFFER="sudo $LBUFFER"
  fi
}
zle -N prepend-sudo
# shortcut keys: [Esc] [s]
bindkey "\es" prepend-sudo
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/prepend-sudo.gif" alt=""></p><p>If you’re using oh-my-zsh you can add the <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/sudo/sudo.plugin.zsh#L32">sudo plugin</a> and the default key binding is <code>esc, esc</code>.</p><h3 id="open-command-in-editor">Open command in $EDITOR</h3><p>There is a really handy command <code>fc</code> which will open your last command in your $EDITOR.
It’s great for long or multi-line command edits.</p><p>There are lots of other ways to accomplish editing the last command you can check out <a href="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/blob/master/docs/config/history.md#modifying-the-last-command">here</a>.</p><p>To edit your current command in your editor add this snippet to your .zshrc</p><pre><code>autoload -U edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
# shortcut key: [Esc] [v]
bindkey "\ev" edit-command-line
</code></pre><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/fc-example.gif" alt=""></p><p>Now next time you copy/paste a multi-line command from somewhere it’ll be easy to edit.</p><h3 id="cut-current-line-and-then-paste-it-on-your-next-prompt">Cut current line and then paste it on your next prompt</h3><p>If you need to run a command before the command you currently have typed you can cut/yank it and then paste/pop it at your next prompt with yank-pop.
This gif explains it better.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/rothgar/mastering-zsh/raw/master/img/push-input.gif" alt=""></p><p>In zsh this is called <code>push-line-or-edit</code> and it’s a default widget you can enable with.</p><pre><code>bindkey '^q' push-line-or-edit
</code></pre><p>A bonus feature is your cursor line will be in the same place after the command is pasted to the new prompt.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><h2 id="d4ba">Project Management</h2><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://blog.maddevs.io/@tamaramun?source=post_page-----a850df35b3----------------------" rel="noopener"><div><p><img alt="Tamara Mun" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*kYv_s7Yqw5w34iwqYxKzww.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></p></div></a></div></div></div></div></div><p id="e40e">We continue to share our experience in project management. In the previous article, we shared advice on how to lead your project to fail, today we will talk about how to ruin a relationship with a customer.</p><p id="cfd7">Most of the IT projects imply constant cooperation between the team members and customers. Although it might be often overlooked, the role and the importance of the client within the project is very crucial. Thus, it is in your interest to build a strong relationship based on trust. However, gaining trust on a single occasion is not a dealmaker — you have to maintain and reinforce it by every action.</p><p id="931c">As a project manager at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=ruin-relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a>, I have worked with quite many clients and gained first-hand experience and knowledge on how to elevate trustful partnerships. Here are my <strong>5 wake-up calls, </strong>which indicate that you are on the verge of losing credibility and setting doubts on your expertise to clients.</p><ol><li id="5fc9"><strong>Lacking transparency</strong></li></ol><p id="c403">We often talk about the great importance of transparency for businesses in a modern-day world. Even though companies implement the latest software to achieve the required level of transparency in the documentation and on organizational levels, there are still easy to eliminate yet often overlooked aspects such as transparent communication.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Lacking transparency." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3" width="1000" height="643" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YFeXFZYeEBnR1l_3?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="426d">Nowadays, the ability to collaborate with people from around the globe is more feasible than ever before. As globalization brings us closer to each other, we have to remember that everybody comes from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Such cases are commonly found in slack group channels when someone starts speaking in the language that not every member of the group understands as a native speaker. Yes, maybe the majority do understand it, but the person who did not is going to feel left out and neglected.</p><p id="c8bd">I would suggest implementing a one language policy not only for video calls with the client but also for every group chat where he/she participates.<strong> Of course, it is not only about the language barrier but the overall feeling of inclusivity. </strong>It also would be better to avoid any inside jokes and topics that a person might not be familiar with.</p><p id="73dc"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Broken promises</strong></p><p id="14a4">Have you scheduled a deadline for fixing a bug with your front-end engineer, but he asks for an extension? Sounds familiar, right? I can’t even count how many times such irresponsible actions were putting me into a risky position with a client and upsetting the whole team. Because for a team to operate as a single entity, everyone should be self-organized and committed to common goals. The well-structured team is key to an outstanding final product, which will leave the client satisfied with the result and a feeling of a civil partnership. And as the word of mouth rules, good reviews can bring more customers to your services.</p><p id="6a88">I believe it is essential to create an environment where achievements and success can be regularly tracked and celebrated because it helps team members to stay focused and keep track of their responsibilities and tasks. For example, we at <a href="https://maddevs.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=how-ruin-relationship-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Devs</a> have been implementing the OKR approach (Objectives and Key Results). And I am already seeing the positive impact it brings to the teams because it provides each member with a clear vision of the goals. Clear goals make it easier for them to contribute and allocate their time efficiently.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Broken promises." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF" width="1000" height="626" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*o9lkaU-C6v_dZZfF?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4780"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Poor reporting</strong></p><p id="e23a">Reporting might be a point of frustration for companies in the early development stages or teams that don’t have a clear organizational structure. For example, you have signed off the project with the client and carefully planned it. Then you are proceeding to the execution stage. Your engineering team is working hard on developing the product, but at the same time, the client is continuously asking questions about the progress made. And don’t get me wrong, an interested, and involved client is an excellent thing! Yet clients repeatedly asking questions about development may be evidence of a poor reporting process in the team. <strong>The team should proactively share what’s going on in the project to keep everyone up-to-date.</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Poor reporting." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*nzozwoSexQ4DBOxP?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2059">Nowadays, the client’s involvement in the project is higher than ever before. The client participates at almost every stage of the project. Therefore, it is vital to set the right plan for further interaction and give the client easy access to check the team’s progress. Moreover, modern-day solutions make it way easier to accomplish this goal by using project management apps such as JIRA, Trello, Basecamp, etc. You can create a very sophisticated and easy-to-comprehend schedule where all the deadlines and set goals can be tracked and updated while also giving customers more tools and room to be involved and supervise the project.</p><p id="c35f"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Discrediting the team</strong></p><p id="adf8">This point will probably better resonate with a project manager. Imagine a situation where the deadline is approaching you, but the QA team found new bugs that are delaying the release. And now, you have to explain your struggle to the client. This conversation is not going to be one of the most relaxed, but you have to remain calm and clear-minded, no matter what. Otherwise, it is easy to fall in the pitfall of assigning the blame to other team members and shedding the wrong light. You have to remember that any problems that may arise will be faced by the team together, and there can’t be any scapegoats. If something is falling apart, it indicates poor time management or a lack of planning and testing.</p><p id="2909">Aside from the previous example, it is essential to remember that disclosing any problems you have within the team with the client is probably not the best solution. If you have any complaints about a specific member, this feedback should be discussed directly with the recipient and in privacy.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Discrediting the team." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*6eYldh-XObisdJHI?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="db4e"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Ignoring clients’ needs</strong></p><p id="8aa4">Often some ideas of how the final product should look like are diverging between developers and clients. And, understandably, engineers are getting very committed to it throughout the project and trying to improve it in every possible way. Yet being absentmindedly carried away by such ideas can negatively result in your relationship with the customer. If the feature you are trying to implement is not on his/her priority list and you are spending a significant amount of time working on it, <em>(while the more appropriate stack of work is being pushed to the side</em>), you might end up not meeting the main goal and therefore not fulfilling clients’ wishes.</p><p id="9662">Even though such enthusiasm from team members is well appreciated, any modifications that are wished to be made should be negotiated and approved by the customer to prevent future misunderstandings.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Ignoring clients’ needs." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r" width="400" height="257" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*4PiDuyJQ8vbjfl3r?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="8f87"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p id="7c4d">Of course, these wake-up calls don’t cover every possible issue. However, I believe that these small miscommunications can be fixed without any pain and increase your credibility in the customers’ eyes. I hope this article will help you be more attentive to your actions, and no client/team relationship is going to be further harmed by any of the points I mentioned above.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3164/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png" width="1582" height="860" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HY7Xf7_ZZ5psxB-xK_s8ZA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="9888">Feel free to leave any comments or any other useful tips you have concerning this subject.

We have implemented several projects with video or audio calls enabled. That’s why I want to share my thoughts on when to build your own solution from scratch, when to use open source alternatives and when to order a custom solution from a third-party vendor.</p><p id="e70f">First, let me say a few words on the experience we gained with WebRTC in the recent few years.</p><ul><li id="1121">We came up with a SIP via WebRTC solution for a taxi management system that works in the Namba taxi project (Kyrgyzstan).</li><li id="5826">We built a PoC solution for a live chat widget that also included video and audio calls.</li><li id="ce1d">We built a PoC solution for a click-to-call button for websites.</li><li id="72d2">Integrated video calls for <a href="https://teacherly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacherly</a> (UK).</li></ul><p id="f9b9">We needed to build a new dispatch system for Namba Taxi which was designed as a single-page web application. You could find more information about the differences between a mobile app and a single-page web application here:</p><p id="a935">We had several options for enabling calls to mobile phones in the browser, such as using a flash softphone and through WebRTC-based solutions. We decided on the second option because it was a brand new way to build audio and video communications, and flash was going to become an unsupported technology in a few years.</p><p id="a988">We solved a lot of problems on our way to a working solution. Finally, we found out that the combination of <a href="https://sipjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sip.js</a> and <a href="https://freeswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeSWITCH</a> is the most stable and feature-rich solution that covers all our needs.</p><p id="11dd">Here are the pros we found:</p><ul><li id="ddf8">It removed all our workarounds, like <a href="https://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asterisk</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/webrtc2sip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webrtc2sip</a>+<a href="https://www.doubango.org/sipml5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sipml5</a> (these problems are described below).</li><li id="3121">This solution is neat and easy to understand for all project newbies.</li><li id="24f1">FreeSWITCH has more stable upgrades compared to Asterisk. They don’t break backward compatibility, and the overall quality of FreeSWITCH is better.</li><li id="f756">SIP.js is a well-designed and easy-to-use library that has better code and better compatibility with all browsers.</li></ul><p id="aa2d">And here are the cons of this solution:</p><ul><li id="b17e">Maintenance can be harder because everything has to be managed by your team. It’s hard to find a sysadmin with VOIP experience and an understanding of how it works.</li></ul><p id="9653">We also faced some issues with FreeSWITCH running in the production environment, see (1) &amp; (2) below.</p><ol><li id="30e0">Calls didn’t work on production on Firefox 38+, because their developers removed the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DTLS-SRTP</a> protocol and enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PFS</a> by default. PFS for FreeSWITCH was enabled in the next release though.</li><li id="f171">We had problems with Chrome 48+ because their developers changed their WebRTC API design. We solved this issue by moving from <a href="https://jssip.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jssip</a> to sip.js.</li></ol><p id="299f">Here are the solutions we tried to use, before deciding on a combination of FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="2a6a">Asterisk with WebRTC enabled + SIPML5.</li><li id="ab45">Asterisk with webrtc2sip + SIPML5.</li><li id="3f04">FreeSWITCH + jssip.</li></ol><p id="a485">The problems we faced before combining FreeSWITCH and sip.js:</p><ol><li id="78ba">The call hold feature didn’t work. We found a workaround by muting the dispatcher’s microphone.</li><li id="ae07">Crashes of the webrtc2sip media proxy. We had to go with a workaround here: during alpha testing, we implemented an automatic restart on failure because Asterisk had problems with WebRTC implementation.</li><li id="dbf6">Asterisk stability issues and a lot of crashes. We tried to run Asterisk without a media proxy and discovered that it’s hard to make it work. We had different crashes for two versions of Asterisk and found out that the Asterisk + webrtc2sip combination works fine for us.</li><li id="4886">Wrong configuration for STUN and TURN servers on both sides. The wrong configuration leads to one-way or no-audio issues.</li><li id="e7d3">We had a problem when we hung up the call from a mobile device. In that case, SIPML5 was calling. We fixed it by checking the status of a call on ‘I_new_call’ event and then tried moving to jssip and, finally, to sip.js.</li><li id="394a">WebRTC calls stopped working when we upgraded our Asterisk to 1.7 version. The problem here was caused by the incompatibility of invites. When Asterisk bridges call, it sends an invite using the AVP transport, while the webphone accepts only AVPF transport. Hence we get 603 SIP error with “failed to get local sdp” message. We decided to use webrtc2sip as a media proxy before Asterisk.</li><li id="014f">Memory leaks in webrtc2sip.</li></ol><p id="1638">At first sight, it’s easy to get a working prototype. To deploy it in our production environment, we will need to make sure that all of the following has been done:</p><ul><li id="e197">Ensure that video calls work with all types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAT</a>.</li><li id="d8e8">Ensure that all codecs work on different devices matching them with each other.</li><li id="71c4">Solve connectivity issues between all peers.</li><li id="848c">Deal with tradeoffs between latency and throughput for the best user experience.</li><li id="13c7">Solve issues to build a working and stable set of STUN and TURN servers that will work fast to gain speedier connectivity to the call.</li><li id="555e">Deal with tradeoffs between choosing the right audio sources because when we have two users talking right now we will have issues with the quality of sound.</li></ul><p id="b0e7">Try to avoid development from scratch. You can implement it only if it’s a key feature of your product. Solving all these problems can increase your time-to-market metric, and your release day may be postponed. Fortunately, you have other options to shorten the time to market.</p><h2 id="10c1">Open Source solutions</h2><p id="7078">During the COVID-19 crisis, we implemented video calls for the Teacherly project using <a href="https://jitsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jitsi</a>. All the above-mentioned problems were solved by them, and we found it a very stable solution with great design, documentation, and SDKs.</p><p id="8e13">Jitsi’s pros and cons are listed below.</p><p id="3c54"><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li id="bddb">A complete working solution for audio and video calls with the support of group conferencing.</li><li id="6820">Easy to integrate.</li><li id="2dae">Integration can be done with your current team without extra resources.</li></ol><p id="fb53"><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ol><li id="6f26">You will have full control over the source code (as it is an open-source solution), but you will need time to clearly understand what’s in it in case you require additional customizations or new features.</li></ol><h2 id="9d6c">Third-party solutions</h2><p id="95fa">Another great option is to pay money to a WebRTC provider and integrate it with solutions like 3cx, Twilio, or Voximplant. They all have features that can be useful for your project.</p><p id="7fe3"><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li id="745a">They can be members of the webRTC consortium.</li><li id="d8c1">They have experience in solving almost all problems described above related to WebRTC calls.</li><li id="21a4">They have reasonable pricing.</li><li id="9c56">They have all the required SDKs for smooth integration.</li></ol><p id="f5aa"><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ol><li id="2586">There is no control of source code, but changes can be implemented by your current team.</li><li id="8167">Vendor lock-in (you depend on the service you have chosen).</li></ol><p id="4ec8">When time-to-market is critical, you should take a look at these third-party solutions.</p><ul><li id="e6e0"><a href="https://peerjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peer.js</a>. With peer.js, you can implement your own P2P calls across multiple devices, but you may need a <a href="https://peerjs.com/peerserver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaling server</a>.</li><li id="7f35"><a href="https://jitsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jitsi</a> is a ready-to-deploy video conferencing software with SDKs for mobile and web.</li><li id="99ad"><a href="https://www.3cx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3cx</a> is a feature-rich service for communications.</li><li id="b52e"><a href="https://voximplant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voximplant</a> is a video conferencing solution.</li><li id="0e99">Agora.io is a communications platform offering various options for video communications.</li><li id="58be">Livewebinar.com offers software for conducting webinars.</li><li id="639f"><a href="https://freeswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freeswitch</a> is a Software-defined Telecom Stack of tools and technologies.</li><li id="4eb6"><a href="https://sipjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sipjs</a> is the JS library enabling one to successfully combine WebRTC and SIP signaling.</li></ul><p id="4dd6">All these products can help you build your own solution for audio or video calls in your project.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OzJUNsPx60" width="320" youtube-src-id="4OzJUNsPx60"></iframe></p><p>I recently came across a YouTube video about an exciting new development. Researchers at NVIDIA enabled an AI to essentially recreate PAC-MAN after watching some 50,000 episodes of the game being played. The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/22/gamegan-research-pacman-anniversary/" target="_blank">blog post</a> makes for fascinating reading and it made me think more about the potential machine learning could have for mobile game development.</p><p>Machine learning is a fast growing industry that was worth $6.9bn globally in 2018 alone, according to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/machine-learning-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grand View Research</a>. Furthermore, recent research by <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/machine-learning-market-2494" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Market Research Future</a> indicates it is expected to grow by around "42.08% CAGR during the forecast period 2018–2024". A lot of reporting done by media outlets such as <i>Forbes</i> have highlighted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/01/19/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2020/#7e93fbb85c02" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">potential growth</a> in areas such as driver safety, internet security, applications in the financial market et al.&nbsp;</p><p>What about mobile gaming, though? Machine learning is already being used by companies in this space to improve <a href="https://addepto.com/monetize-mobile-gaming-machine-learning/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monetisation</a>&nbsp;(helping to create personalised in-game offers, for example),&nbsp;but I think there are some exciting applications for machine learning still to come:</p><div><ul><li>Rapid prototyping: train an AI to watch gameplay of say, hypercasual games, and feed in art and music to create prototypes of new games quickly and efficiently. You could easily create multiple variations if needed.</li><li>Crowd-sourced games: Imagine a social media site where game ideas are submitted. The most popular ideas are turned into games there and then.</li><li>Personalised 'Netflix for mobile games': Don't like the guns in your mobile FPS? Imagine a service where game assets are personalised on the fly. You could have games to play wherever you want them, how you want them.&nbsp;</li><li>New gift idea: this idea of intimate personalisation opens up the market for personalised mobile games as gifts. You could give someone a platformer, for example, just the way they like it, with their own ideas incorporated in it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>With the emergence of this technology, it could also challenge existing business models and relationships between developers and publishers may change. How will it work if prototypes can be quickly made without too much human intervention? Will developers be paid per successful idea? Will everything be dependent on great art or music?&nbsp;</p><p>There are exciting and challenging times ahead and the games that emerge from this period will reflect that.&nbsp;</p></div>

As I wrote <a href="https://staticcatgames.blogspot.com/2020/07/do-mobile-game-revenue-models-need-a-rethink.html" target="_blank">recently</a>, Apple is altering contracts for some of its Apple Arcade developers as it focuses more and more on the need for engagement instead of throwing large numbers of games at subscribers and hoping something will stick. Apple execs have come to the conclusion that throwing money at games and building a large library of games just won't cut it. Bankrolling games for little to no return isn't a viable business model in the long term. <i>MacRumors </i>gives an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/30/apple-arcade-game-strategy-shift/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">example of the costs</a>, saying: "Apple has funded work on many games that have been created for ‌Apple Arcade‌, spending between $1 million and $5 million on several titles so far." <br> What they need are players to carry on, well, <i>playing </i>these games day in, day out.&nbsp; <br> The major problem Apple is facing is that none of the games in the Apple Arcade portfolio are major hits. It needs to rectify this and fast. Competition for the subscription service comes from its own app store, which offers a vast number of games (…

Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp; <br> While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp; Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series XNintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example.

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

<p>At the current moment, neural nets are trained once, in the “training phase” and then inputs are sent to them to test their intelligence. But as I sit here somewhat affected by cannabis, I realize that any sufficiently strong artificial general intelligence will have to have some type of analog of drugs just like we do.</p>



<p>Everyone likes to say that an AGI would be so much more powerful than ourselves. Now would you consider an AGI that was unable to take drugs superior to a human? The thing is that if we want AGIs to have parity with ourselves then any training that they undergo should be equivalent to any kind of questions that we ask them. Currently NN are the way they are because we’re exploiting AI for cheap computations. </p>



<p>Lets let’s rewind for a sec and ask a hypothetical question. What would happen if I took a human brain outside the body and asked it a question and then tried to extract the answer. Aside from all the complexities of encoding and decoding, we don’t know if the writes to the brain can be disentangled from the reads to the brain. It doesn’t seem like anyone has even asked the question: Does an AGI need to have both reads and writes intertwined in such a complex way to produce intelligence? Perhaps, this is the easiest way to produce AGI.</p>



<p>I believe self-modifying neural nets are the solution to AGI. Our current neural nets are designed as commodity tools for calculations – literally designed to eventually, after training, become a frozen set of, in GPT-3’s case, 175 billion parameters. I do believe if we want to have a chance with GPT-3 becoming AI, we will need to somehow pipe the results of its conversations back into itself..online training. Is this being considered at all?</p>



<p>Let’s put self modification back and allow our neural nets to take drugs. As silly as that sounds it really is the path forward. For neural nets that need to execute quickly, we can figure out ways to ignore the writes and only do the reads for performance reasons. We should start designing architectures based on self-modifying principles. Paradigms in AI need to change. ML can stay where it is if all it wants to do is model pure functions with non-linear pipelines of matrix operations.</p>

		<p>Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by understanding the universe. I began as a game hacker, tearing things down, taking them apart (figuratively, using Softice and Ollydbg.) I made mods for HL using Small C. And websites in PHP. I went to university for Biomedical Sciences but did not pursue an MD. I kept doing software development. I worked for many startups and then big name companies, like Amazon.</p>
<p>The corporate culture was not for me. Startup culture was not to my liking either, however better than the toxic culture at Amazon. I prefer to remain independent, although I would love to get a PHD in Pure Mathematics. It's tough to go back to school though I would love to.</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, I've switched gears to Mathematics and Physics. I bought many used textbooks and am in the middle of studying real/complex analysis. It is a steep hill to climb, but having learned computer science / algorithms, and read lots of Claude Shannon, Gregory Chaitin, Von Neumann, and other logician/computer scientist's work, has given me a unique perspective on the relationship between information, computation, physics, and life/consciousness. Many mathematicians can not even program. I feel it is a huge mistake when the subjects are so interconnected.</p>
<p>I have many ideas but the one I am seeking to fund is called Life. Most ambitious projects that aim to simulate OUR universe, fail for lack of computing power, and lack of a Grand Unified Theory - it's a fruitless and frail endeavor.</p>
<p>INSTEAD, I aim to reduce the necessary universal principles to ones that are necessary just for life to exist and sprout. This is not an easy task, and one can never be sure if one can create life. Perhaps our universe is very special and uniquely able to produce life whereas other configurations will fail. There is no way to know except to try. Even if we fail to produce life, there will be interesting behavior discovered.</p>

				<p><em>“It doesn’t matter how amazing your product is, or how fast you ship features. The market you’re in will determine most of your growth.” - Sahil Lavingia, Gumroad CEO</em></p>

<p>Let’s say Sahil is right. If Gumroad’s growth is restricted by the size of the indie creator market, then one way for Gumroad to ensure its future growth is to actively grow the indie creator market itself.</p>

<p>Stripe has the ambitious goal of “increasing the GDP of the internet”. They claim that this is because “removing the barriers to online commerce helps more new businesses get started, expedites growth for existing companies, and increases economic output and trade globally”.</p>

<p>This means that Stripe does things that don’t meaningfully grow Stripe directly. Stripe Atlas, for example, helps founders navigate the red tape involved in forming a new company, and Indie Hackers helps independent creators build businesses with the help of a supportive community.</p>

<p>These initiatives don’t provide immediate, quantifiable results in the way that a paid acquisition campaign would. In the long run, though, this strategy expands Stripe’s total addressable market, and beneficiaries of this market growth are disproportionately likely to use Stripe rather than another payment solution.</p>

<p>Stripe’s mission is audacious. Sure, Stripe is a $35b+ company with truckloads of capital for moonshot projects, and Gumroad isn’t. Even so, I think that Gumroad could frame its growth strategy in a similar way.</p>

<p>How can Gumroad increase the GDP of the indie creator economy?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is focused mainly on the distribution side of growth. See <a href="https://mkjung.com/blog/substack">How I would grow Substack</a> or <a href="https://mkjung.com/blog/contracts">The future of contracts is code</a> for my product-centric posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of my research for this post, I reached out to four Gumroad creators who answered my questions on their experience as a creator. I’ve included snippets of their responses throughout this post.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2 id="i-gumroads-1-metric">I. Gumroad’s #1 metric</h2>

<p>Gumroad helps creators do more of what they love.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkjung.com/images/Gumroad/Gumroad_goal.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One way to quantify how effective Gumroad is at helping “creators do more of what they love” is volume processed. So this will be the top-line number that I focus on in this post.</p>

<p>We can break volume processed down into two buckets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Volume processed = volume processed per creator * number of creators</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can then break each of these numbers into two further buckets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Volume processed per creator = price per unit * number of units sold per creator</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number of creators = acquisition * retention</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breaking down our volume processed metric like this helps us understand the various levers that drive that number. I’m going to assume that Gumroad can’t do much to effect the price per unit sold, because that’s set by the creators. That leaves us with three levers that <em>are</em> within Gumroad’s control:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“number of creators”, which can be further broken down into acquisition and retention; and</li>
  <li>“number of units sold per creator”.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can visualize this as a “volume processed” framework, with the blue circles representing levers that can be moved:</p>

<p><img src="https://mkjung.com/images/Gumroad/volume_processed_chart.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this post, I’ll go through each of these levers in turn. But first, let’s talk about how creators create content.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="ii-the-four-phases-of-a-content-creator">II. The four phases of a content creator</h2>

<p>Making content is a long process. Gumroad makes distribution easy, but by the time a creator gets to this point, there’s already been a long timeline of events that have occurred. Usually, the only visible part of this timeline is when the product is released and distributed. I like the analogy of an iceberg to describe this phenomenon.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkjung.com/images/Gumroad/Phases_iceberg.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ll use myself as an example. Six years ago, I liked making music in my spare time, so I decided to <a href="https://mujuj.bandcamp.com/">make an EP</a>.  Here’s what that process looked like:</p>

<p><strong>Phase 0 – Default state (99.9% of my life)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>No or little interest in making music</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 1 – Base-building (1 year)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning about music production</li>
  <li>Finding production equipment</li>
  <li>Learning production software</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 2 – Content creation (4 weeks)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Composing/songwriting/arranging</li>
  <li>Recording music</li>
  <li>Mixing – EQ levels, compression, etc.</li>
  <li>Mastering</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3 - Release and distribution (1 day)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Putting music on the internet</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>
</ul>

<p>In my case, I was just a kid messing around with a guitar and second-hand equipment in my bedroom. “Releasing” my project meant uploading it on Bandcamp and “distributing” it meant asking friends to check out my mixtape. I made $5.00.</p>

<p>But even if I had grander ambitions, releasing the project would still have been by far the least difficult and frictionless aspect of the process. Gumroad and its creators only get paid in Phase 3, but most of the obstacles in the creative process are actually in Phases 1 and 2.</p>

<p>The further down the iceberg you go, the harder it is to effect change. Phase 1 is harder to effect than Phase 2, and Phase 2 is harder to effect than Phase 3. And getting people from 0 to 1 at scale is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>So it makes sense that Gumroad would start by focusing at the top of the iceberg, rather than the bottom. Phase 3 strategies are focused around helping creators distribute their products — say, for example, Gumroad’s “Discover” feature and reorganizing the onboarding flow so that it’s easier to upload content. However, focusing solely at the top of the iceberg limits growth because most of Gumroad’s would-be creators are further down.</p>

<p>With this in mind, let’s think about how Gumroad could acquire and retain creators stuck in Phase 2 (and earlier phases).</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="iii-lever-1-acquisition">III. Lever 1: Acquisition</h2>

<p>Gumroad doesn’t spend any money on customer acquisition. Instead, Gumroad’s customer acquisition process looks like a loop:</p>

<ol>
  <li>New creator joins</li>
  <li>Creator sells content</li>
  <li>Other creator see that a creator is selling content on Gumroad</li>
  <li>New creator joins</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mkjung.com/images/Gumroad/acqloop.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One important aspect of this growth loop is that it doesn’t just acquire creators who are making decisions <em>right now</em> about how to distribute their products, but it acquires <em>future</em> creators who are still stuck in Phases 1 and 2. If a future creator is browsing their Twitter feed and finds someone selling, say, photo sets on Gumroad, they’re more likely to use Gumroad to create their own photo sets when they eventually move to Phase 3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most professional artists I follow typically have mentioned Gumroad at one point or another when selling their products … so I just went with the most popular option whose name I heard being passed around the most.” <em>Meg Syverud, creator of “A Study in Scarlet &amp; Blue: A Spider-Man AU Comic”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This loop is a great growth engine, but Gumroad can find more opportunities for growth by framing acquisition in different terms: how can Gumroad move creators from Phase 2 to Phase 3?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="gumroad-generated-content">Gumroad generated content</h3>

<p>I’d like to see Gumroad experiment with building its own content aimed at helping creators move from Phase 2 to Phase 3.</p>

<p>I’m sure that content marketing isn’t a new concept for Gumroad. For starters, like most companies, they have an active blog. I’d also consider Sahil’s Twitter to be a form of content marketing — most of the Gumroad creators I’ve spoken to have mentioned Sahil’s tweets as playing a part in them discovering Gumroad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t know if I can pinpoint [how I found out about Gumroad]. I’d definitely seen Sahil in the community via Twitter, blog posts, and podcasts.” <em>Alex DeBrie, author of “The DynamoDB Book”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’m not sure if Gumroad has tried to create content with the express goal of moving creators across phases. There are two requirements for this kind of content. It needs to be (1) useful enough to meaningfully impact on creators’ movement between phases and (2) interesting enough to actually be consumed.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkjung.com/images/Gumroad/Content_venn_diagrampng.png" alt=""></p>

<p><span>From Priceonomics’ <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-content-marketing-handbook/">content marketing handbook</a> — replace “information that helps your company” with “information that helps creators create content” and you have the intersection that Gumroad should be aiming for. Incidentally, Priceonomics’ content marketing handbook is itself a great example of the type of content that Gumroad could produce.</span></p>

<p>When I was in Phase 2, I sought out videos on music production and blog posts on affordable home studio setups. If I made my EP with the guidance of a full-length Gumroad handbook or video course covering the entire “Phase 2” hobby-album production process from beginning to end, I would have been all but guaranteed to have used Gumroad as my distribution platform. Also, importantly, it could have been the difference between releasing my project and giving up before getting to Phase 3.</p>

<p>One problem with this idea is that it’s hard to test quantitatively. It’s really difficult to definitively establish that a new creator joined Gumroad because of a piece of content that they consumed.</p>

<p>So here’s how I would experiment with content. I would deep-dive into three of Gumroad’s biggest or most promising categories and talk to creators to understand the process of moving from Phase 2 and Phase 3 within these segments. Then, I would produce a comprehensive piece of content for each of these categories. I would take advantage of Gumroad’s internal data and access to creators to produce interesting content that nobody else can.</p>

<p>Here’s a few examples of the type of content Gumroad could create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to Create, Design, and Release your Own Ebook</li>
  <li>How to Create a Video Course from Start to Finish</li>
  <li>The Complete Guide to Creating a Music Album</li>
</ul>

<p>These examples are pretty generic. The more longtail Gumroad goes, the more likely it is that they’ll create valuable content that isn’t easy to find elsewhere. Too far longtail, though, will mean that the addressable market for their content will be too small to be worth the investment.</p>

<p>A few months after this content is created, I would test a new cohort of creators to figure out (1) how they heard about Gumroad, and (2) why they became a Gumroad creator. I could then measure what percentage of those creators joined Gumroad because of its content, which when extrapolated, would provide an approximation of the total number of new creators being acquired …</p></article></div>

                    <p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) is aimed to transfer human cognitive intelligence into machines. Simply put, we want machines to think like us. But how do we achieve it? is a big bang question. Many companies use the word “Artificial Intelligence” to attract clients and capture the market. But they may have no idea what they are talking about. Artificial intelligence has not been recognized as an attempt to make machines intelligent. It has been more focused on intelligent automation, as described by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hodfleishman/2020/02/19/is-artificial-intelligence-a-myth">Hod Fleishman</a>, a contributor to Forbes. </p><p>We have achieved faster automation, better data processing, automatic tasking, pattern recognition and multi-scale decision making in the name of Artificial intelligence (AI). But if we look deeper with a critic view, it was all about intelligent automation. We have not taught machines how to think like a human. Machines do not start working until we train them to do. A sewing machine cannot stitch the wounds of a human until we teach them to do so. A blender cannot wash clothes by itself as it is not meant to learn this by itself. </p><p>So the Buzz word “Artificial Intelligence” must not be used right now. We have not achieved it yet. Machine Learning (ML) is a more suitable word currently can be used in the field of artificial intelligence. How we train a computer or a machine to do a specific task? We provide them a huge huge amount of data that covers every aspect of certain functionality. For example, in language processing, we provide a big catalog of words and phrases to make a semantic sense of a certain language. If we train a machine to learn English, it would not be able to learn Chinese by itself. So we should say the machine is as intelligent as its maker is, or less. </p><p>To make the machines think like us, we have to think like machines first. The core idea is not to put a brain in a machine but to make machines performing a specific task using their own built and capabilities. For example, if we want to cook something, we need hands, vision, smell, utensils and other accessories. But if we want to automate the cooking process, we do not need robotic hands with multiple angular movements. We just need cooking material, automatic cutter, and supplier, stove, and utensils. The focus is on the result, not the way of completing the task.</p><h3 id="how-to-make-a-machine-truly-intelligent">How to make a machine truly intelligent?</h3><p>The human mind can forget and learn using previous experience. A child needs to see a cat twice before he remembers the cat. It looks so simple, as the human brain is no complex and augmented with senses. To make a machine remember the animal as a cat, we have to provide it with a huge amount of image data with all possible angles and points. Then the machine can recognize the patterns and declares it as a cat. Will the machine delete the non-related information we have provided by itself? Humans do this all the time i.e. forgetting useless information and attaining updated information and making inferences. We call it experience.</p><h3 id="what-human-have-that-machines-lack">What human have that machines lack?</h3><p>Our decisions are based on observations and emotions. We feel faster than we think. We react to the same stimulus differently under different emotional states. Our culture may influence our decisions. What machines lack are emotions. The machine performs in 1+1=2 fashion. They do what the data provided to them does. It is a big question about how to inject emotions into machines.</p><h3 id="approaches-to-ai">Approaches to AI</h3><p>There are two approached to artificial intelligence. </p><p>1. &nbsp;Deep neural networks are the best way to collect a huge amount of data and process it to make certain patterns. However, they cannot perform abstraction (the exact wanted data). </p><p>2. &nbsp;Symbolic AI can provide abstraction but cannot process big data. When both technologies are coupled, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may be achieved. Google’s AlphaGo is the best demonstration for such a merger. <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>is the first program to defeat a human Go player. </p><p>So, before we claim to achieve AI, we must teach machines how to process the data, keep only relevant information, discard the useless one and set a rule. More the rules implanted, more tasks can be performed by machines. Even if a human is given lots of irrelevant information, he will become confused. So before achieving true AI, we first work on data models. If reunited, Both symbolic AI and deep neural networks can help achieve limited AI very soon. </p><h3 id="when-can-we-achieve-true-ai">When can we achieve true AI?</h3><p>We cannot answer this question right now. We do not fully understand the functionality of our brains. How can we create a fully functional brain in machines? What we can achieve are baby steps towards automated problem-solving. More technological advances and more processing power we have, quickly we can achieve limited to true artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>When in password hunting mode and having access to the filesystem of the target, most people would reach out to SAM and/or extracting cached credentials.
While this can usually be the way to go, it can pose a huge challenge, as the result can depend on the strength of the storage format of the password and the strength of the password itself.
Something often overlooked is hiberfil.sys and/or virtual machine snapshots or memory dumps, as they usually contain passwords in plain text.
When you have those, there’s no need for cracking at all and it doesn’t depend on password strength/size.</p>

<p>Methods described in this article can be used in different scenarios: from the DFIR side and also from the offensive side.
Main requirement is that you somehow have access to the required file (like hiberfil.sys), snapshot or the memory dump.
It can be from the backup, obtained from the live system or a virtual machine. It doesn’t matter.
The only challenge is to actually convert it to the proper format of standard crash dump format (DMP).</p>

<p><img src="https://diverto.github.io/images/hiberfil-dump-password/conversion-paths.png" alt="Conversion Path"></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>We’re taking advantage of a less known feature of mimikatz that it can work on memory/crash dumps through windbg extension called <code>mimilib.dll</code>.
This technique is <a href="http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/securite/mimikatz/windbg-extension">quite old</a> and <a href="https://www.remkoweijnen.nl/blog/2013/11/25/dumping-passwords-in-a-vmware-vmem-file/">already known</a>, but that information is still not that widespread, especially the part that you can take the advantage of the Volatility framework for conversion.</p>

<h2 id="file-copy-methods">File copy methods</h2>

<p>Windows uses hiberfil.sys as a file where it stores hibernated (RAM) data. Its usual location is <code>C:\hiberfil.sys</code> and it is hidden system file, so you will have problem with copying it directly.
There is excellent article <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/copy-locked-file-in-use-with-hobocopy/">7 Tools to Copy Locked or In Use Files</a> that can help you obtain it from the live system.</p>

<p>I had good experience with extracting system files from vmdk, vhd and similar formats using PowerISO (even with the trial version).</p>

<p>There are some cases where hiberfil.sys is present, but it is not yet used. It is a good practice to actually check if hiberfil.sys is empty (all zero bytes).
File size can be quite big, but there is still a possibility that it’s filled with only zero bytes.
The following shell oneliner can help you in determining if file is filled with zero bytes only:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cat </span>hiberfil.sys | <span>tr</span> <span>-d</span> <span>'\0'</span> | <span>read</span> <span>-n</span> 1 <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"All null bytes"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oneliner will display <code>All null bytes</code> if file is filled with zero bytes.</p>

<h2 id="converting-hiberfilsys-to-dmp-format">Converting hiberfil.sys to dmp format</h2>

<p>hiberfil.sys cannot be read directly by windbg, so hiberfil.sys should be converted to standard crashdump dmp format which can be read by windbg.
There are multiple ways to do it. We can take advantage of the Volatility Framework or commercial Comae Toolkit (aka Moonsols tools).</p>

<h3 id="converting-to-dmp-format-using-volatility">Converting to dmp format using Volatility</h3>

<p>Conversion using Volatility Framework is multi-step process. First, it is good practice to identify the image itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> d:<span>\h</span>iberfilsys.copy imageinfo
<span>Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also get the basic information about the hibernate file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> d:<span>\h</span>iberfilsys.copy <span>--profile</span><span>=</span>Win7SP1x64 hibinfo

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first step is to convert it to the raw memory dump format using <code>imagecopy</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> d:<span>\h</span>iberfilsys.copy imagecopy <span>--profile</span><span>=</span>Win7SP1x64 <span>-O</span> hiber.raw
<span>Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next step would be to convert raw memory dump to the crash dump format using <code>raw2dmp</code> volatility command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> hiberfil.raw <span>--profile</span><span>=</span>Win7SP1x64 raw2dmp <span>-O</span> hiberfil.dmp

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="converting-to-dmp-format-using-comae-toolkit">Converting to dmp format using Comae Toolkit</h3>

<p>There is straight way to convert hibernate files to crash dump (dmp) format.
Comae toolkit comes with Hibr2Dmp.exe utility which can directly convert the target hibernate file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>Hibr2Dmp.exe hiberfil.sys hiberfil.dmp

<h2 id="converting-virtualization-snapshots-to-dmp-format">Converting virtualization snapshots to dmp format</h2>

<p>hiberfil.sys cannot be read directly by windbg, so hiberfil.sys should be converted to standard crashdump dmp format which can be read by windbg.
There are multiple ways to do it. We can take advantage of Volatility Framework or commercial tool like Comae Toolkit (aka Moonsols tools).</p>

<h3 id="converting-vmware-snapshot-to-dmp">Converting VMware snapshot to dmp</h3>

<p>VMware saves the memory dump of the guest virtual machine every time you snapshot the virtual machine when the guest is running.</p>

<p>Once you have the snapshot, in most cases you have raw memory image in vmem file.
You just need to find the snapshot file ending with .vmem.</p>

<p>The next step consists of converting raw memory dump to the crash dump (dmp) format.
There are different ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>VMware have its own tool called <code>vmss2core</code> that you can use to convert vmem file to crash dump (dmp) format.</p>

<p>You can use it the following way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>vmss2core.exe -W snapshot.vmsn snapshot.vmem
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the snapshot file is from a Windows 8/Server 2012 or later VM, the command line is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>vmss2core.exe -W8 snapshot.vmsn snapshot.vmem
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output of this command is <code>memory.dmp</code> file in same directory.</p>

<h4 id="alternative-vmware-conversions">Alternative Vmware conversions</h4>

<p>One of the alternatives, would be to convert it using <code>Bin2Dmp.exe</code> from <a href="https://my.comae.io/">Comae Toolkit</a> :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>Bin2Dmp.exe vmware.vmem vmware.dmp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Other alternative is to use Volatility’s <code>raw2dmp</code> converter, but you will need to specify the profile:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> vmware.vmem <span>--profile</span><span>=</span>Win7SP1x64 raw2dmp <span>-O</span> vmware.dmp
<span>Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
Writing data (5.00 MB chunks): |..........|
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="converting-virtualbox-snapshot-to-dmp">Converting VirtualBox snapshot to dmp</h3>

<p>VirtualBox memory dumps can be triggered by using <code>debugvm</code> command of vboxmanage:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>vboxmanage debugvm <span>"win7test"</span> dumpvmcore <span>--filename</span> testvbox.elf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>VirtualBox memory dump comes in ELF format where load1 segment holds the raw memory dump.
So, simple bash script was made to extract only the raw memory dump.
<a href="https://github.com/andreafortuna">Andrea</a> already released a helpful script, but the script itself did not work for me.
So, I have modified it to work and published it as
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kost/606145346d47c5ed0469d4e9ac415927">vboxelf2raw</a>.
Usage of vboxelf2raw is illustrated in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># ./vboxelf2raw.sh testvbox.elf</span>
testvbox.elf -&gt; testvbox.elf.raw <span>(</span>off: 0x2560, size: 0x80000000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By having the memory dump in a raw format, further process is straightforward.
Using Volatility’s <code>raw2dmp</code> command, raw format is converted to the crash dump (dmp) format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C:\&gt;</span><span> </span>volatility_standalone.exe <span>-f</span> testvbox.elf.raw <span>--profile</span><span>=</span>Win7SP1x64 raw2dmp <span>-O</span> testvbox.dmp
<span>Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6
Writing data (5.00 MB chunks): |..........|
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output of the previous command is a file <em>testvbox.dmp</em> in dmp format.</p>

<h2 id="dumping-passwords-through-windbg">Dumping passwords through Windbg</h2>

<p>Once you have the file in a dmp format, you can easily load the obtained dump in the windbg using <code>File -&gt; Open Crash Dump</code> and load the file:</p>

<p><img src="https://diverto.github.io/images/hiberfil-dump-password/windbg-crashdump-file.png" alt="Windbg open crash dump"></p>

<p>Now, you just have to load <a href="https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz">mimikatz</a> windbg plugin (mimilib.dll), find lsass process in the dump and invoke mimikatz to perform its magic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.load d:\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimilib.dll
!process 0 0 lsass.exe
.process /r /p fffffa800a25ab30
!mimikatz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>fffffa800a25ab30</code> is the address I actually obtained in the previous step (<code>!process 0 0 lsass.exe</code>).
You can check the steps in the following screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://diverto.github.io/images/hiberfil-dump-password/windbg-mimi.png" alt="Windbg open crash dump"></p>

<p>If you don’t get any output when you issue command <code>!process 0 0 lsass.exe</code>, check if the target is 32 or 64 bit.
If the target is 64 bit and you get x86 prompt like this:</p>



<p>That means that probably you need to force switch to 64-bit using the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>.load wow64exts
!wow64exts.sw
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will switch to 64-bit and prompt should look like this:</p>



<p>When you get a 64-bit prompt, you can try to repeat the process again (finding the lsass process and dumping it with mimikatz).</p>

<p>As you can see, the process identified the password <code>Strong!Passw0rd11</code>, which is quite long and, having only the hash, would take quite some time to crack it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Authentication Id : 0 ; 82274 (00000000:00014162)
Session           : Interactive from 1
User Name         : user
Domain            : user-PC
Logon Server      : USER-PC
[..]
        tspkg :
         * Username : user
         * Domain   : user-PC
         * Password : Strong!Passw0rd11
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="volatility-mimikatz-plugin">Volatility mimikatz plugin</h2>

					<p><em>Google Play&nbsp;removes Boomerang Parental Control – I share our recent experience dealing with Google’s Appeals team.</em></p>
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are a team of three Dads with the combined goal of helping families start conversations with their kids about technology use. Over 5 years ago, the core features were built by our CTO based on his own family’s needs to limit his son’s time spent on his tablet. We innovated way before the big companies and continue to innovate having features that the big companies do not have. Now that everyone is aware of the essential need to ensure that our kids grow up with a balanced approach to technology usage, the big companies built their own tools with a massive competitive advantage: they own the operating system they want to control. In 2018, Apple made changes that saw&nbsp;us have <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">difficulties supporting iOS devices</a>&nbsp;after announcing screen time features in iOS12.&nbsp;In early 2019,&nbsp;<a href="http://useboomerang.com/2019/03/13/boomerang-vs-google-re-call-sms-permissions/">Google also changed their permission requirements</a> for apps declaring Calls and SMS permissions which&nbsp;was used with parents’ consent for our calls and text message safety features (this guideline change resulted in us offering&nbsp;a <a href="http://useboomerang.com/download/">sideload download option</a>&nbsp;that continues to offer&nbsp;these safety features). Now in 2020, it seems Google is taking similar measures on Android with their Family Link app which is tied into your Google account. Below is a timeline of our recent experience with the Google Play Appeals Team who have shown a very inconsistent relationship with their developers and how they review apps. There were some very frustrated messages back to Google’s Appeals Team below as we strongly believe Google’s completely in the wrong with their assessment of our apps and leveraging their size and strength to force us into changing (which we have yet are still stuck in a Rejected state at the time of this post).</p>
<h3>Experience with Google’s App Review</h3>
<p>Compared to Apple’s App Store app reviews, Google Play app reviews are way more automated. In the past year we received a few false positives where we were rejected for Deceptive Behavior in <a href="https://useboomerang.com/">Boomerang Parental Control</a> and our other app, <a href="https://filterchrome.com/">Filter Chrome</a> because our app didn’t allow the user to uninstall our app “easily”. Please note our apps are designed to be installed on kid devices owned by parents and self-identifying pornography addicts with our Filter Chrome app. A prevent removal feature is key to keep these users safe and is employed by all competitors, including Google’s own Family Link. I call these false positives as when we would upload a new version, without any changes except for a higher version number, our update would pass and we would be fine for months after. I can confirm this is a fairly common practice by Google Play developers, including apps in our parental control category.</p>
<p>This May, we had a similar violation but our apps were completely removed from Google Play within a few days of our updates (these updates were bug fixes). We thought similar to our previous experience so we proceeded to upload another update in the same fashion… This time was different. As an Android developer, when we update our app, we will upload it to what is called the “Alpha Track” on our Google Play Console. This where our update will be published and only available as an “internal” version for us to test before releasing to the public (what is called the Production track). We had never had our Production version completely removed from Google Play before for an update we published in the Alpha track. We received the same robotic template reply with the same Deceptive Behavior violation but this time, Google’s App Review completely removed our Production app from the Play Store. No warning and an ambiguous message that they couldn’t uninstall our app. We tried the same previous method of doing a version update but this time we were completely stuck. Below is the full documented timeline of events in our experience – we feel we have been wrongly targeted here and need to bring visibility into this poor handling by Google which has also cost a month’s revenue so far.</p>
<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
<p><strong>May 8th 2020:</strong> Our latest update (version 1257) gets flagged for <strong>“CAN’T UNINSTALL APP – Your app violates the Deceptive Behavior policy.”</strong> (screenshot below) The link to their policy does not state anything related to uninstall actions but mentions “<strong>Apps that modify device settings or features with the user’s consent but do so in a way that is not easily reversible.”</strong> There are no examples of what easily reversible looks like. Boomerang Parental Control, just like many other apps like us <span><strong>including Google’s own Family Link</strong></span>, have an easily reversible approach to turning off protection and uninstalling. The reality of parental control apps is, Parents do not want an easily removable app on their child’s Android device – this is a fact and product management 101. Plus, it’s with our user feedback that we added this feature several years ago so our app cannot be removed easily by a child – this is also a key component to any parental controls parent pay for. On some devices, it is not possible to fully lock in our app so we still offer a notification to parents when their child tampers with our app by either turning off specific permissions like the Device Administrator.</p>

<p><strong>May 11th, 2020:</strong> I filed an Appeal [3-0733000030602] with the Google Play Appeals Team. Based on previous experience, I also resubmitted an update to our app as a way to see if this was just an error by Google’s app review robots.</p>
<p><strong>May 13th, 2020:</strong> Our update gets approved (screenshot below).</p>

<p><strong>May 14th, 2020:</strong> Reply from the Appeals Team with the following message, <span>no actual feedback on my message to the Appeals Team on the removal that occurred on May 8th 2020</span>. <em>Tip for developers: You also do not receive a copy of your original message to them so make sure to make a copy.</em></p>

<p>At this point, we thought all would be fine just like previous experiences where we get flagged, republish an update, receive approval and stay live on Google Play. In this case, only until June 26th. This is when things started to really feel like targeting by Google’s review team.</p>
<p><strong>June 26th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message which flagged multiple versions of our&nbsp;Filter Chrome&nbsp;versions, many were archived and never released to the public.</p>
<p><img src="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png" alt="06262020 - FIlter Chrome versions removal" width="960" height="684" srcset="https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-1024x730.png 1024w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-300x214.png 300w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-768x548.png 768w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-600x428.png 600w, https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/24102905/06262020-FIlter-Chrome-versions-removal-875x624.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p><strong>June 30th 2020:</strong> After 45 days of smooth operation (since our May 14th update), Boomerang Parental Control gets flagged again for the same ambiguous CAN’T UNINSTALL APP reason – 4 days after our&nbsp;Filter Chrome app gets flagged too for the same reason. I’m saying ambiguous as what is mentioned in the email (see below) does not share the language of the policy I’m supposed to use to make corrections to the violation. Furthermore, I know our competitors and <strong>Google’s own Family Link use the same approach</strong> that Google’s App Review says we are in violation of. This is absolute hypocrisy.</p>

<p><strong>July 2nd, 2020:</strong>&nbsp;I filed another appeal with the following message. For clarity, our prevent removal feature is not enabled by default without the user’s consent. The parent/guardian or self managing person using our apps must manually turn on our app protection.&nbsp;You&nbsp;cannot get a copy of your appeal message so I copied it this time.</p>
<p><em><span>Message sent in the Appeals form</span>: </em></p>
<p><em>We do not have anything in our Parental Control app Boomerang that has a prevent removal feature. Why the removal? Your guidelines are not being followed by your robots and I’m repeating myself again that your guidelines does not explicitly mention anything related to “CAN’T UNINSTALL APP”. I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE – NO MORE CANNED TEMPLATE REPLIES, PLEASE.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your robots looking for? Keywords in the metadata? User review keywords (which in our case come mostly negatively from kids who have their parents install our app on the kids phones that parents own!).</em></p>
<p><strong>July 3rd, 2020:</strong> I reactivated my Premium account on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpayeur/" target="_blank">LinkedIN</a> and researched key contacts in Google Play’s Policy Team such as “Policy Leader” and “Policy Specialist”. I found about 20 whom I sent them a similar InMail message to the following screenshot below. Update July 22nd, 2020: I have yet to receive any feedback/reply from the people who create and manage Google Play’s Policies.</p>

<p><strong>July 6th, 2020: </strong>We had to inform our users about our difficulties with Google as inquiries were pilling in from them sharing that they were no longer able to find our app on Google Play. Our email was&nbsp;titled “<a href="https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=def604cc98ecfc90acf27aec4&amp;id=a786c3e4c0" target="_blank">Google has become Evil</a>”. We received several replies, including a few like the following:</p>
<p><em>Does this mean that my son will be able to uninstall boomerang from his device? If so, the program will be absolutely worthless to me!</em></p>
<p><em>Are you saying that there will no longer be any protection on uninstallation of the app? If so, what is even the point of the app? Is this going to be completely discontinued or just the Play Store version?</em></p>
<p><em>Removing the prevent uninstall option doesn’t make it worth paying for, obviously. Is this going to be fixed, or do I end my subscription and get the balance refunded to me?</em></p>
<p><strong>July 7th, 2020:</strong> I received the following message from the Google Play Team. My gut is now not feeling right (deja vu of <a href="http://useboomerang.com/2020/01/31/letter-users-apple-parental-controls/">our experience with Apple in 2018/2019</a>). My reply is included here too – <em>as of July 22nd, 2020, I have yet to receive any answers to my previous questions.</em></p>

<p><strong>July 8th, 2020:</strong> The following reply is received from Google. Google is now quoting various policies to build a case against our approach in protecting our app which is still allowed in many other apps recently updated on Google Play, <strong>including their own Family Link</strong>, a direct competitor to Boomerang Parental Control. Upon reviewing our app protection, we did find we could improve how the protection works to make it clearer to the user (typically a child, not an adult) on why the Device Administrator permission is protected. This mimicked many other apps I reviewed on Google Play so we made the change and pushed this update with the …</p></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™ve just been readÂ­ing <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/user/lukeprog/">Lukeâ€™s</a> <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/hN2aRnu798yas5b2k/a-crash-course-in-the-neuroscience-of-human-motivation">â€œCrash Course in the NeuÂ­roÂ­science of HuÂ­man MoÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion.â€�</a> It is a useÂ­ful text, alÂ­though there are a few techÂ­niÂ­cal erÂ­rors and a few bits of outÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion (see [1], upÂ­dated inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion about one parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar quibÂ­ble in [2] and [3]).</p>
<p>There is one sigÂ­nifiÂ­cant missÂ­ing piece, howÂ­ever, which is of critÂ­iÂ­cal imÂ­porÂ­tance for our subÂ­ject matÂ­ter here on LW: the effect of atÂ­tenÂ­tion on plasÂ­ticÂ­ity, inÂ­cludÂ­ing the plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tion. Since I donâ€™t see any other texts adÂ­dressÂ­ing it diÂ­rectly (cerÂ­tainly not from a neuÂ­roÂ­scienÂ­tific perÂ­specÂ­tive), letâ€™s cover the main idea here.</p>
<p>SumÂ­mary for imÂ­paÂ­tient readÂ­ers: foÂ­cus of atÂ­tenÂ­tion physÂ­iÂ­cally deÂ­terÂ­mines which synapses in your brain get stronger, and which arÂ­eas of your corÂ­tex physÂ­iÂ­cally grow in size. The imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions of this provide diÂ­rect guidance for alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion of beÂ­havÂ­iors and moÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tional patÂ­terns. This <em>is</em> used for this purÂ­pose exÂ­tenÂ­sively: for inÂ­stance, many benefits of the CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy apÂ­proach rely on this mechanism.<a id="more"></a></p>

<p><strong>I â€“ AtÂ­tenÂ­tion and plasticity</strong></p>
<p>To illusÂ­trate this propÂ­erly, we need to define two terms. Iâ€™m guessÂ­ing these are very faÂ­milÂ­iar to most readÂ­ers here, but letâ€™s cover them briefly just in case.</p>
<p>First thing to keep in mind is <em>the</em> <em>plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</em> In essence, parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar funcÂ­tional arÂ­eas of our brain can exÂ­pand or shrink based on how ofÂ­ten (and how inÂ­tensely) they are used. A small amount of this growth is physÂ­iÂ­cal, as new axÂ­ons grow, exÂ­pandÂ­ing the white matÂ­ter; most of it hapÂ­pens by reÂ­purÂ­posÂ­ing any less-used cirÂ­cuitry in the vicinity of the acÂ­tive area. For exÂ­amÂ­ple, our sense of sight is proÂ­cessed by our viÂ­sual corÂ­tex, which turns sigÂ­nals from our eyes into lines, shapes, colÂ­ors and moveÂ­ment. In blind peoÂ­ple, howÂ­ever, this part of the brain beÂ­comes inÂ­vaded by other senses, and beÂ­gins to proÂ­cess senÂ­saÂ­tions like touch and hearÂ­ing, such that they beÂ­come sigÂ­nifiÂ­cantly more senÂ­siÂ­tive than in sighted peoÂ­ple. Similarly, in deaf peoÂ­ple, auÂ­diÂ­tory corÂ­tex (part of the brain that proÂ­cesses sounds) beÂ­comes adapted to proÂ­cess viÂ­sual inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion and gather lanÂ­guage clues by sight.</p>
<p>SeÂ­cond conÂ­cept weâ€™ll need is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"><em>soÂ­matosenÂ­sory corÂ­tex</em></a> (SSC for short). This is an area of the (verÂ­teÂ­brate) brain where most of the inÂ­comÂ­ing touch and poÂ­siÂ­tional (proÂ­priÂ­oÂ­cepÂ­tive) senÂ­saÂ­tions from the body conÂ­verge. There is a map-like qualÂ­ity to this part of our brain, as evÂ­ery body part links to a parÂ­ticÂ­uÂ­lar bit of the SSC surÂ­face (which can be illusÂ­trated with silly-lookÂ­ing things, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensory_Homunculus.png">senÂ­sory hoÂ­muncuÂ­lus</a>). More touch-senÂ­siÂ­tive arÂ­eas of the body have larger corÂ­reÂ­spondÂ­ing arÂ­eas within the SSC.</p>
<p>With these two in mind, letâ€™s conÂ­sider one acÂ­tual exÂ­perÂ­iÂ­ment [4]. ScienÂ­tists meaÂ­sured and mapped the area of an owl monÂ­keyâ€™s SSC which beÂ­came acÂ­tiÂ­vated when one of his fingerÂ­tips was touched. The monÂ­key was then trained to hold that finger on a tacÂ­tile stimÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tor â€“ a movÂ­ing wheel that stimÂ­uÂ­lates touch reÂ­cepÂ­tors. The monÂ­key had to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to the stimÂ­uÂ­lus, and was reÂ­warded for letÂ­ting go upon deÂ­tectÂ­ing cerÂ­tain changes in spinÂ­ning freÂ­quency. After a few weeks of trainÂ­ing, the area was meaÂ­sured again.</p>
<p>As you probÂ­aÂ­bly exÂ­pected, the area had grown larger. The touch-proÂ­cessÂ­ing neuÂ­rons grew out, co-optÂ­ing surÂ­roundÂ­ing cirÂ­cuitry in orÂ­der to achieve betÂ­ter and faster proÂ­cessÂ­ing of the stimÂ­uÂ­lus that proÂ­duced the reÂ­ward. Which is, so far, just anÂ­other way of showÂ­ing plasÂ­ticÂ­ity of corÂ­tiÂ­cal maps.</p>
<p>But then, there is someÂ­thing else. The SSC area exÂ­panded only when the monÂ­key had to <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion</em> to the senÂ­saÂ­tion of touch in orÂ­der to reÂ­ceive the reÂ­ward. If a monÂ­key was trained to keep a hand on the wheel that moved just the same, but he did not have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to itâ€¦ the corÂ­tiÂ­cal map reÂ­mained the same size. This findÂ­ing has since been repliÂ­cated in huÂ­mans, many times (for inÂ­stance [5, 6]).</p>
<p>Take a moÂ­ment to conÂ­sider what this means.</p>
<p>A man is sitÂ­ting in his livÂ­ing room, in front of a chessÂ­board. ClasÂ­siÂ­cal muÂ­sic plays in the backÂ­ground. The man is foÂ­cused, thinkÂ­ing about the next move, about his chess stratÂ­egy, and about the fuÂ­ture posÂ­siÂ­bilÂ­ities of the game. His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing him a betÂ­ter chess player.</p>

The man is foÂ­cused, gritÂ­ting his teeth as anÂ­other flash of pain comes from his bad back. His neuÂ­ral netÂ­works are opÂ­tiÂ­mizÂ­ing, makÂ­ing the pain more inÂ­tense, easÂ­ier to feel, harder to igÂ­nore.</p>

<p><strong>II â€“ PracÂ­tiÂ­cal imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tions: makÂ­ing and breakÂ­ing habits, effiÂ­cacy of CBT </strong></p>
<p>HaÂ­bitÂ­ual learned beÂ­havÂ­iors are ofÂ­ten illusÂ­trated with the exÂ­amÂ­ple of drivÂ­ing. When we are learnÂ­ing to drive, we have to pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to evÂ­eryÂ­thing: when to push the pedÂ­als, when to sigÂ­nal, where to hold our handsâ€¦ A few years later, these beÂ­havÂ­iors beÂ­come so auÂ­toÂ­matic, we hardly pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion at all. InÂ­deed, most of us can drive for hours while carÂ­ryÂ­ing on conÂ­verÂ­saÂ­tions or listenÂ­ing to auÂ­dioÂ­books. We are comÂ­pletely unÂ­aware, as our own body keeps pushÂ­ing pedÂ­als, sigÂ­nalÂ­ing turns, and changÂ­ing gears.</p>
<p>We can thereÂ­fore say that <em>drivÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­iors</em>, through pracÂ­tice and atÂ­tenÂ­tion, evenÂ­tuÂ­ally beÂ­come auÂ­toÂ­matic â€“ which is, most of the time, a good thing. But so do many other things, inÂ­cludÂ­ing some deÂ­strucÂ­tive ones we might want to get rid of. Letâ€™s take a simÂ­ple one: nail bitÂ­ing. You are readÂ­ing, or watchÂ­ing a movie, or thinkÂ­ing, or drivÂ­ingâ€¦ when you sudÂ­denly noÂ­tice some minor pain, and reÂ­alÂ­ize that you have chewed your nail into a ragged stump. Ouch!</p>
<p>You catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing, you stop. Five minÂ­utes later, you catch yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing again. You stop again. ReÂ­peat <em>ad inÂ­finiÂ­tum</em>, or <em>ad nauÂ­seam</em>, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>CogÂ­niÂ­tive-BeÂ­havÂ­ioral TherÂ­apy has a highly sucÂ­cessÂ­ful apÂ­proach for breakÂ­ing habits, which reÂ­quires only a very subÂ­tle alÂ­terÂ­aÂ­tion to this proÂ­cess. You noÂ­tice that you are bitÂ­ing your nails. You imÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ately foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on what you are doÂ­ing, and you stop doÂ­ing it. No rage, no blamÂ­ing yourÂ­self, no negaÂ­tive emoÂ­tions. You just stop, and you foÂ­cus all the atÂ­tenÂ­tion you can on the act of stopÂ­ping. You move your arm down, foÂ­cusÂ­ing your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the act of moveÂ­ment, on the feelÂ­ing of your arm goÂ­ing down, away from your mouth. Thatâ€™s it. You can go back to whatÂ­ever you were doÂ­ing.</p>
<p>Five minÂ­utes later, you noÂ­tice yourÂ­self bitÂ­ing your nails again. You calmly reÂ­peat the proÂ­ceÂ­dure again.</p>
<p>By doÂ­ing this, you are trainÂ­ing yourÂ­self to perform a new beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ the â€œstop and put the hand downâ€� beÂ­havÂ­ior â€“ which is itÂ­self trigÂ­gered by the nail-bitÂ­ing beÂ­havÂ­ior. As you go along, you will get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at noticÂ­ing that you have started to bite your nails. You will also get betÂ­ter and betÂ­ter at stopÂ­ping and putting your hand down. After a while, this will beÂ­come semi-auÂ­toÂ­matic; youâ€™ll noÂ­tice that your hand went to your mouth, a nail touched your tooth, and the hand went back down beÂ­fore you could do anyÂ­thing. Donâ€™t stop trainÂ­ing: foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on the â€œstop and dropâ€� part of the acÂ­tion.</p>
<p>After a while, the nail-bitÂ­ing simÂ­ply goes away. Of course, the more comÂ­plex and more inÂ­grained a habit is, the more effort and time will be needed to break it. But for most peoÂ­ple, even strong habits can be relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly weakÂ­ened, or rediÂ­rected into less deÂ­strucÂ­tive beÂ­havÂ­iors.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly obÂ­viÂ­ous that habits can be <em>creÂ­ated</em> in this way as well. We donâ€™t beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we do â€“ we beÂ­come betÂ­ter at things we <em>pay atÂ­tenÂ­tion to while weâ€™re doÂ­ing them.</em> If you want to make exÂ­erÂ­cise a habit, your efforts will be much more effecÂ­tive if you foÂ­cus your atÂ­tenÂ­tion on your exÂ­erÂ­cise techÂ­nique, rather than reÂ­peatÂ­edly thinkÂ­ing how painful and tiring the whole proÂ­cess is.</p>
<p>There is also a diÂ­rect imÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tion for trainÂ­ing in any comÂ­plex skill. Start with the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve">learnÂ­ing curve</a> effect: we gain a lot of skill relÂ­aÂ­tively quickly, and then imÂ­proveÂ­ments slow down inÂ­creÂ­menÂ­tally as we apÂ­proach our maxÂ­iÂ­mum poÂ­tenÂ­tial skill level. It is relÂ­aÂ­tively easy to go from a poor to a mediocre tenÂ­nis player; it is much, much harder to go from mediocre to good, and even harder to go from good to exÂ­celÂ­lent.</p>
<p>ComÂ­plex skills have many differÂ­ent asÂ­pects, which we usuÂ­ally atÂ­tempt to train siÂ­mulÂ­taÂ­neously. We can beÂ­come very good at some, while stayÂ­ing poor at othÂ­ers. The opÂ­tiÂ­mal apÂ­proach would be to foÂ­cus most of our atÂ­tenÂ­tion on those asÂ­pects where our abilÂ­ities are weakÂ­est, since smaller inÂ­vestÂ­ments of time and effort will lead to larger imÂ­proveÂ­ments in skill.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I’ve been a big fan of Nassim Taleb’s Incerto. He wrote a series of essays on life, where all the topics revolve around decision making under uncertainty. I wanted to dig deeper on some of the more technical concepts he alluded too, so last year I explored a few textbooks on probability theory.</p><p>I was surprised with how elegant the field was. The most inspiring idea to me was how the originators interpreted probability through set theory. Not only is it a beautiful way to look at things, but by seeing it this way, they could apply few axioms, leverage set theory, and badabing badaboom they had a whole field’s worth of discoveries.</p><p>I wanted to share with you an example from one of the textbooks, that illustrated the power of seeing probability through this lens, and demonstrated how you could begin deriving complex ideas from the simplest kernel.</p><h2>Boxes and balls</h2><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUxODM5LTYwNThjZDgwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS04YjE0LWQ2ODhiZGY0Y2MwMC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>Let’s say you have 2 boxes. In Box 1, you have 99 red balls, and 1 white ball. In Box 2, you have 99 white balls, and 1 red ball.</p><p><strong>You pick a box at random, then, you pick a ball from that box.</strong></p><h2>Question 1: What’s the chance that you pick a red ball?</h2><h3>Memory</h3><p>This can get a bit tough to reason about. There’s a 50% chance you pick Box 1. In Box 1, you have a 99% chance. If you picked Box 2, you have a 1% chance. How do we combine these probabilities together?</p><p>If you reason the way you were taught in high school, you may think like this: </p><p>Well, there’s a 50% chance I pick Box 1, and a 99% chance after that to pick a red ball
And, there’s a 50% chance I pick Box 2, and a 1% chance after that to pick a white ball. </p><p>So the total probability can be <code>50% * 99% + 50% * 1%</code></p><p>Which is 49.5% + 0.5% which is…50% </p><p>Now this will work, but notice how the probability was 50% — Did you really need to do all that work to figure this out? (1)</p><h3>Intuition</h3><p>Let’s reimagine what <em>probability</em> here means. First, let’s consider: what are <em>all</em> <em>the possible outcomes</em>?</p><p>For out experiment, an outcome must contain two choices: The box we chose, and the ball we chose after that. We could represent it like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUxODc0LTZlYTZlOTgwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS05YTNlLTA1MjEyY2MxM2M2OC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This is <em>one outcome — we picked Box 1, then picked Red Ball 1.</em> </p><p>How many of these outcomes do we have?</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUxOTE2LTdiYzNkODgwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS05ZTU0LWE0ZWQzNzVhOTBkMS5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>We can list it out: we pick Box 1, Red Ball 1, Box 1…Red Ball 99, etc. In total, we would have 200 possible outcomes. </p><p>Now that we have all the outcomes in mind, we can answer the question: <em>what’s the probability that we pick a red ball?</em></p><p>Well, how many outcomes contain a “red ball”? </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUxOTYwLTg4NDgzMTAwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS05NjVhLTczNGJiNjRlMDE3ZC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>Looks like 100. This means that 100 of 200 outcomes would give us the result “we got a red ball” — 100/200 makes 50%</p><p>Note how this boiled down to just “counting” the outcomes we cared about. Is it really that easy? Let’s try with a harder example.</p><h2>Question 2: You picked a red ball, what’s the probability that it came <em>from</em> Box 1?</h2><h3>Memory</h3><p>This question can get pretty hairy to answer from what we learned in high school. <em>Given</em> that we chose a red ball, what’s the chance that it was Box 1? Well, there are 99 red balls in Box 1, and only 1 red ball in Box 2, so the chance that it came from Box 1 is <em>very high.</em> But how high? </p><p>We may recall Bayes Theorem here, but the formula can be hard to remember.</p><h3>Intuition</h3><p>However, if we think in sets, we can <em>kind of</em> derive Bayes Theorem. Let’s look at our outcomes again:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXBlci1hdHRhY2htZW50cy5kcm9wYm94LmNvbS9zX0RERUJEQUI4NDM4RTBDRTI1QkUzNjUyNDEyQ0NDNkE4NENCMEE2OTBBQjlFMTBGMzFFMzE0NENCRTE5NjJGOURfMTU5MDUyODI4MDUzNF9pbWFnZS5wbmc"></span></p><p>How many of these outcomes contain “red ball”?</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUyMTQ1LWJkZWQxYTAwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS04NGU3LTVlNDIzNzQ3N2VjNi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>Yup, 100 total. Since we <em>know</em> we got a red ball, this means that we could have <em>only gotten</em> one of these 100 outcomes.</p><p>Out of these outcomes, how many come from “Box 1”?  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzgzMDUyMTcyLWM2ZGRlYjgwLWEwMDMtMTFlYS04MTU3LTg0YWVjMjA4YTBlZi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>That's 99 outcomes. So out of 100 outcomes that could have happened, 99 of those came from Box 1. 99/100 and you have a 99% chance that given a red ball, it came from Box 1. </p><p>This too, just came down to counting the number of outcomes. Now, it can get a lot more difficult — what if you can’t possibly count the number of outcomes? what if each outcome has a different probability? But, just from this notion of events forming a set of possible outcomes, we can chug along and derive out quite a bit.</p><p>(1) Alexandre came up with a pretty beautiful intuitive solution to question 1: consider symmetry — since the problem is symmetric (you can reverse white and red), it implies the only solution could be 50%</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alexandre Lebrun, Bipin Suresh, Mark Shlick, Davit Magaltadze for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>By making testing new blockchain networks less asymmetric between users and developers (users get rewarded for the time they pour into testing new product developments), incentivized testnets have emerged as <strong>a compelling way to attract the first Validators and Delegators of new proof-of-stake projects</strong>, and bootstrap their security by producing and endorsing their first series of blocks.</p>

<p>In that spirit, to better align the interest of the community (earn DSLA rewards and DSLA compensations) with the interest of core DSLA developers (product-market fit), we are proud to announce that we will be organizing a <strong>DSLA incentivized beta test</strong> using a test version of the DSLA Network, the first decentralized application implementing the DSLA Protocol.</p>

<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla_network.png" alt="DSLA Network"></p>

<p>On <strong>September 30th 2020</strong>, the DSLA Network DApp hosted of the Ropsten Ethereum network will <strong>reward beta participants using DSLA tokens with actual market value</strong>.</p>

<p>For our team, your contribution will be the perfect chance to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the DSLA Network before <strong>launching on the mainnet on November 30th 2020</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-dsla-incentivized-beta-test">The DSLA Incentivized Beta Test</h2>

<p>By outsourcing block production and endorsement to third party staking providers, Delegators do not need to operate their own blockchain node to earn staking rewards. But at the same time, they are exposed to the potential bad behaviour and unfulfilled reliability promises of Validators.</p>

<p><strong>This puts their staking deposit at risk of being depleted (slashing penalty).</strong></p>

<p>DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts for derisking staking services. It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a staking service, earn rewards when the staking service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the staking service doesn’t meet expectations.</p>

<p>A test ERC-20 token called <strong>bDSLA</strong> will be issued on the Ethereum test network, to specifically empower the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test.</p>

<p>Just like their real counterpart, bDSLA tokens will be used to pay for the periodic verification of DSLA contracts, and empower the reward / compensation scenarios of the DSLA Protocol.  When the protocol launches on the mainnet this year, <strong>bDSLA token holders will then be able to convert their bDSLA rewards and compensation into real DSLA tokens</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="starring-harmony-one-and-more">Starring Harmony (ONE) and more</h2>

<p>The DSLA Incentivized Beta will exemplify how the <strong>DSLA Protocol provides a decentralized way to derisks the staking experience of some of the best blockchain networks out there</strong>.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that Harmony ONE staking deposits will be amongst the first assets supported by DSLA Protocol during the incentivized beta test!</p>

<h3 id="about-harmony">About Harmony</h3>

<p>Harmony is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Through secure and random state sharding, the Harmony Mainnet supports thousands of nodes that produce blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The protocol’s Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and <strong>double-sign slashing</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="harmony-x-dsla-protocol">Harmony x DSLA Protocol</h3>

<p>During the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test, ONE Delegators will be able to easily hedge against Validators downtimes and double-sign slashing risks, by <strong>signing Staking Efficiency DSLA contracts</strong> and <strong>staking bDSLA tokens</strong> in the reward pool.</p>

<p>In parallel, anyone on the Internet will be able to earn bDSLA tokens for protecting ONE Delegators from downtimes and double-sign slashing, by <strong>creating Staking Efficiency DSLA contracts</strong> and <strong>staking bDSLA tokens</strong> in the compensation pool.</p>

<p><strong>Staking Efficiency is the percentage of realized rewards by a Validator.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>In practice, every n days, DSLA contracts compare the measured staking efficiency of a Validator, with the efficiency objective defined in the Staking Efficiency DSLA contract then :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DSLA Rewards</strong> are distributed to contract owners and staking service providers, if the staking efficiency of the designated Validator <strong>does not drop below the defined objective</strong>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>DSLA Compensations</strong> are distributed to contract enrollees, if the staking effiency of the designated Validator <strong>drops below the defined objective</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can wait to see how DSLA will improve the delegation experience of the Harmony community and the Quality of Service of Harmony ONE staking service providers.</p>

<h3 id="more-assets-planned-for-the-beta-launch">More assets planned for the beta launch</h3>

<p>Along with Harmony’s ONE, other popular proof-of-stake assets will be unveiled during the weeks preceeding the DSLA Incentivited Beta. Ever since the project’s inception, we have been talking with world class teams like Harmony to bring Decentralized IT Service Management (ITSM) and Customer Service practices to the DeFi and Open Finance industry.</p>

<h2 id="participating-in-the-beta-as-easy-as-1-2-3">Participating in the Beta: As easy as 1-2-3</h2>

<p>Until the comprehensive Incentivized Beta Test documentation is ready and available, here’s an overview on how to get started with the DSLA Network DApp upon beta launch. It will mostly consist of three simple steps.</p>

<h3 id="️-step-1-acquire-bdsla-tokens">☝️ STEP 1) Acquire bDSLA tokens</h3>

<p>The first time you connect your wallet to the beta, <strong>your bDSLA token balance will be synced once with your real DSLA token balance.</strong></p>

<p>N. B. If you are not a DSLA token holder just yet, you will need to <strong><a href="https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT">first become one</a></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="️-step-2-stake-bdsla-tokens">✌️ STEP 2) Stake bDSLA tokens</h3>

<p>Once your bDSLA token balance is synced, you will be able to :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sign an existing DSLA contract and stake bDSLA to its DSLA Reward Pool;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new DSLA contract and stake bDSLA to setup a new DSLA Compensation Pool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-step-3-compound-bdsla-rewards">🤟 STEP 3) Compound bDSLA rewards</h3>

<p>Extra bDSLA tokens will be periodically claimable by the users that created or signed a DSLA contract, <strong>according to the measured Staking Efficiency of the Validator designated in the contract.</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Engineers have a massive unique advantage in today's economy, one which very few are taking advantage of to build real wealth. That advantage is a high salary coupled with a stable job and a relatively stable industry. That advantage engineers have gets compounded when we factor in the lowest interest rates in human history, in the last 5,000 years it has never been cheaper to borrow money than it is right now. However, few of us are using this advantage to get access to capital and invest in realestate.</p><p>In this post, I will be writing from personal experience of having started investing in realestate almost five years ago. Now to be clear, I am not a real-estate tycoon, just a regular guy. I believe this form of investing is, by far, hands down one of the best investment vehicles to build wealth; all of us have access to use, and yet many engineers know little about it or think its not for them.. This post is a guide for those software engineers, friends that have asked me about the topic, and a lot of beginners out there.</p><p>I will first go through my real-world example of one of my investments, so this isn't some hypothetical, what if, type of post but as raw and real as it gets. Then I will list some of the advantages I've seen first hand about realestate investing.</p><h2 id="my-real-world-example">My real-world example</h2><p>In 2014, I decided that I don't want to pay rent and, more importantly, pay down someone else's mortgage, and decided to start looking for something to buy. The issue I had, like most people, I had little savings. I grew up dirt poor in the Bronx, and although I made it through school and got a great paying job, as a software engineer, I had very little savings for that time.</p><p>As I did my research, I found the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/buying/loans">FHA program</a>, which allows us to buy a house with 3.5% down. So I became intrigued that I could buy a 500k home with 17.5k down plus closing costs. While that sounds risky, I thought even if I get laid off and can't pay my mortgage, God forbid go into foreclosure, at least I'm only losing the 17.5k I put down. The <a href="https://www.hud.gov/buying/loans">FHA program</a> is made for people with a decent salary but who don't quite have the savings. The program has some negative stipulations, that you can read about online and its best to put 20% down if you have it but the point here is you can get started even with very little.</p><p>The great thing is we can refinance out of an FHA loan into a conventional at any point and time; this will also eliminate the FHA insurance or PMI payments as they are called. We would do this when the property value has gone up enough to give us 20% in equity, or we've paid enough of the property down to have 20% in equity in it.</p><p>For me, this happened within a few years. I bought my home, a multi-family, for 535k. I got into it for under 40k total that includes down payment and closing costs. In 2014, rates were also low, and I had a 5/1 adjustable mortgage of 3.3%, which was slated to go up by 1% in 2020.</p><p>The house was a multi-family, so I lived on one side and rented the other. My payment, mortgage + insurance + taxes, was $4,400 a month. My rental income from the other side was $2,300 a month. That means I lived in a home for less than market rent rather than an apartment where I own nothing.</p><p>I decided to refinance the home; by this time, the property value in the area went up to 700k for the same property I bought for 535k. Plus, I had been paying down the mortgage for years, I had far more than 20% equity in the home within a few years. After refinancing, I got a good amount of cash that I could use to buy another property. Since I refinanced and the loan is no longer FHA, I no longer pay the PMI, plus I rent the whole thing and make well over a grand because rents are up and my payment is lower thanks to no PMI and the low rates.</p><p>Let's break it down:</p><figure><img src="https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/2020/07/ximage-17.png.pagespeed.ic.l7_xpS4dZB.png" alt="" srcset="https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ximage-17.png.pagespeed.ic.l7_xpS4dZB.png 600w, https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ximage-17.png.pagespeed.ic.l7_xpS4dZB.png 1000w, https://louiebacaj.com/content/images/2020/07/ximage-17.png.pagespeed.ic.l7_xpS4dZB.png 1092w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="advantages-that-accrue">Advantages that accrue</h2><h3 id="leverage">Leverage</h3><p>Perhaps the most significant reason to put our money into realestate over any other asset we could park it into, such as stocks, besides the volatility of those assets, is the ability to gain <a href="https://nav.al/labor-capital">leverage over our capital</a>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).</p>— Naval (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>How does this work in practice? There is almost no other asset that we can take a hundred thousand dollar down payment and turn it into five hundred thousand of capital that you control and steer. A $100k, 20% down, payment on a single or multi-family rental property will get you a loan from a bank of $400k. As of this writing, that loan will be at rates of about 3.0% for 30 years. There is almost no other kind of loan we could take out that is that cheap, not a student loan, not a credit card loan, not margin on our trading account, nothing will be that cheap.</p><p>Ok, we got the leverage, but what's the point of it? Well, the point of leveraging capital is to use it to make money and build wealth. If we rent the property every month, we are paying back the loan with the rent money and getting more of an ownership stake, equity, in that property. If we do this right, the property should cashflow too on just the 20% down we talked about before, that means not only are we getting equity but we are getting a little money on top of that which is left over for us to keep, a nice little dividend for us if you will.</p><p>We will go into this using real numbers a little further below on this post. However, this isn't hypothetical, and even though realestate is hyper-localized, the model will work almost anywhere in the United States. In addition to that, we don't even need $100k to get started; it is one of the few places of the economy where we can get massive leverage with as little as 3.5% down, we will go into that too.</p><h3 id="multiple-ways-to-make-money">Multiple ways to make money</h3><p>The first and simplest thing I have to get out there is that when investing in a rental property and realestate, most beginners don't realize that they will be making money in more than one way. While this is elementary to the pros, it is worth stating the below on here since most of us aren't pros.</p><ol><li>The first and obvious way is in the rent we are collecting; if we get a good property that cashflows, we keep anything left over after our payment.</li><li>The second way is that we are paying down the mortgage and gaining equity, which means we own more of the property at the end of the year than the 20% we put down.</li><li>The third way is the appreciation of the property, this is where the most unknowns lie, but this is no different than the stock market going up and down.</li></ol><p>So we have three ways to make money and not to mention the numerous tax advantages, which we will discuss below. If we go into this for the right reasons, 30 years later, it is not uncommon for a property to double or triple in value. That means we own an asset that paid itself down fully, gave us money every month, and ultimately increased in value.</p><p>Realestate is one of the few ways to take 100k and turn it into a million dollars in 15-30 years; I don't know of any other asset that lets us do that.</p><h3 id="passive-and-no-significant-time">Passive and no significant time</h3><p>There is a miss conception that is owning a rental property will take up all of your time. </p><p>After all Software engineers are busy people, our companies pay us well to work hard, not look after rental properties. This mean's whatever we invest in needs to be self-sustaining; it needs to be as passive as possible.</p><p>In my view, realestate is perfect for this, and I speak from experience. In the last five years, I have had exactly three issues pop up in my rental property. What were the problems, and how did I resolve them?</p><ol><li>The showerhead on the tenant's bathroom was dripping, and the shower wouldn't fully close.</li><li>A step in the front of the house cracked and broke.</li><li>A leak from the washing machine on the second floor caused the wall to crack on the floor below.</li></ol><p>I fixed every single one of these issues by picking up the phone and calling someone else to fix them. We can google and find a professional business that does this sort of work and call them. It was 5 minutes worth of work for me to do this, I didn't even bother going to look at the issue, I just called someone. The cash flow, plus equity and appreciation of the property, make any amount we spend in repairs meaningless, negligible, and small. Not to mention there are tax write-offs from those repairs which also help us that we will discuss below.</p><p>It is important to caveat this: we need to buy a good property in good shape. Alternatively, we need to go in and do the work or get someone to do the work to get it to good shape because what we are talking about in this post is doing this sort of investment for the long term. For this reason, it may take you a while to find the right property to invest in, which is in good shape, and you can be hands-off, but it is absolutely possible to find.</p><h3 id="tax-advantages">Tax advantages</h3><p>America is such that it rewards specific behavior that society has deemed are suitable and advantageous for it. Owning a home gets rewarded with a tax break, having a kid gets rewarded with a tax break; these things society believes are good for it. Homeowners with kids tend to be relatively stable, and society wants more people to do those things. It goes even further, rewarding us to burrow to get to that point and allowing us to write off the interest on the loan we took to buy our home off of our salary.</p><p>Society also rewards the risk-taker, this is capitalist society after all, and usually, it does so if we are creating work for others either directly or indirectly. If we start a business or make money in any way that isn't as an employee, including rental income, we get access to a whole other set of write-offs. Again this is because society wants to encourage us to do more of that behavior rather than kill our motivation to do it at all.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you generate income of $115,000 from the property, you deduct the $100,000, and IRS can only charge you taxes on the remaining $15k</p>— Yossi Edelkopf (@EdelkopfYossi) <a href="https://twitter.com/EdelkopfYossi/status/1287381969047826433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2020</a></blockquote></figure></div></div>

<p>In our society we revere scientists far more than we revere historians. Consequently, people are often more willing to listen to what scientists say about history than what historians say about history. Unfortunately, often times, when scientists try to speak or write about history, they make glaring mistakes.</p>



<p>For instance, I have already written extensively about how the 1980 television miniseries <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>, written and presented by the astronomer and astrophysicist Carl Sagan,<em> </em><a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/02/05/carl-sagan-was-really-bad-at-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted all sorts of</a> egregious misconceptions <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2018/08/06/who-was-hypatia-of-alexandria-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the Neoplatonist philosopher Hypatia</a> and <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/07/03/misconceptions-about-the-library-of-alexandria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about the supposed destruction of the Library of Alexandria</a>.</p>



<p>The book <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</em>, written by the linguist and psychologist Steven Pinker is one that has been bothering me for a long time. I promised that I would write an article about it in <a href="https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/12/28/how-violent-was-the-pre-modern-world-really/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote last year about violence in the pre-modern world</a>, but I have been holding back until now because I am aware of how popular the book is and what an impact it has had on so many people’s lives.</p>



<p>Bill Gates, for instance, described it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140122115732/http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a review</a> as “one of the most important books I’ve read – not just this year, but ever.” Unfortunately, this book is filled with all kinds of historical inaccuracies and I think it promotes some ideas that, while they may seem comforting in the short-term, are actually deleterious in the long-run.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s basic argument</strong></p>



<p>In case you are unfamiliar with the book, Pinker’s basic historical argument is that all of human history up until the Early Modern Period is a chronicle of superstition, backwardness, barbarity, and relentless, inhuman cruelty. He contends that life in the pre-modern world was, to quote Thomas Hobbes, whom Pinker displays a professed fondness for, “nasty, brutish, and short”; violence was an unavoidable part of everyday life and no one even considered the idea that it was bad.</p>



<p>Then, Pinker contends, in western Europe during the Early Modern Period, people started to become civilized and then the Enlightenment happened and everything has been getting better ever since. Pinker says that, over the past few centuries, humanity has made stunning and remarkable progress in all areas. According to Pinker, we are currently living in the best, most peaceful, most prosperous time in all of human history and things are only getting better overall.</p>



<p>It is easy to see why this story is so appealing. There is a rugged, Whiggish simplicity to it. Furthermore, it is a <em>comforting </em>narrative in which we are not only clearly superior to our ancestors in every way, but also clearly heading in the right direction. It is a real shame that this whole narrative is riddled with inaccuracies and oversimplifications.</p>



<p>Because I do not have time to write a response to Pinker’s entire book, I will focus this review primarily on the sections in the first few chapters dealing with ancient and medieval history. Before I get into it, though, I want to make very clear that I am not disputing Pinker’s argument that violence was generally more common in the ancient and medieval worlds than it is today. What I am disputing, however, is Pinker’s overall portrayal of the ancient and medieval worlds.</p>



<p>From reading Pinker’s book, one comes away with the impression that everyone in pre-modern times was a brutal monster, gratuitous violence was an extremely common, unavoidable part of everyday life, and no one even considered that things like rape, torture, and genocide might be wrong. This is very much an inaccurate portrayal that is rooted in Pinker’s extensive and largely uncritical reliance on a small number of unreliable sources and works of outright fiction.</p>

<p>In his book, Pinker presents the traditionally widely accepted view that prehistoric nomadic societies were unbelievably violent and almost constantly at war. This is very much the traditional view that most scholars have had of prehistoric societies. Prehistory is not my main area of expertise, so I will not dwell on it too much, but I will note that the traditional view advanced by Pinker has been challenged in recent years.</p>



<p>For instance, here’s <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper by Douglas Fry and Patrik Söderberg published in July 2013 </a>that looks at lethal aggression in twenty-one contemporary nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. The paper concludes that, in general, these societies are far less violent than has traditionally been thought. They also observe that most documented cases of lethal aggression in these societies were classifiable as homicides committed by a single person against another person and that actual wars between hunter-gatherer tribes were quite rare.</p>



<p>My view is that the data just isn’t clear enough to make any pronouncements about how violent prehistoric cultures were, since our evidence of these cultures is extremely limited. Also, we need to be willing to recognize that there may have been significant variation in how violent these societies were; just because <em>some</em> hunter-gatherer groups were extremely violent doesn’t mean they all were.</p>



<p><strong>Pinker’s assessment of ancient Greece</strong></p>



<p>Pinker’s description of ancient Greek warfare is almost totally reliant on the portrayal of war in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. The <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey </em>are, however, works of fiction and they are not in any sense accurate reflections of what warfare in archaic Greece was really like. Classicists have known this for at least a century.</p>



<p>For instance, as I discuss in <a href="http://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2019/03/13/did-the-trojan-war-really-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article I wrote in March 2019 about the historicity of the Trojan War</a>, the author of the<em> Iliad </em>seems to have had no idea how chariots were used in Bronze Age warfare. At the time when the <em>Iliad</em> was composed, chariots were no longer used for warfare, but the author of the <em>Iliad</em> seems to have had a vague impression that they had been used for warfare at some point in the past.</p>



<p>Thus, the author of the <em>Iliad</em> imagines chariots being used almost like golf carts, with the warriors riding the chariots to the site of the battle and then disembarking in order to fight on foot in hand-to-hand combat. In historical reality, it seems that warriors who had chariots actually fought in those chariots. Indeed, that was the whole advantage of having a chariot. The <em>Iliad </em>therefore portrays chariots being used in warfare in a way that they were probably never really used.</p>



<p>Fantastic and mythological elements appear all throughout the <em>Iliad</em>. For instance, deities are constantly intervening in the conflict, Achilles’s horses Balios and Xanthos can talk, and heroes are described as lifting massive boulders that no man alive in the poet’s age could lift. In Book Twenty-One of the <em>Iliad</em>, Achilles literally fights a river god who is mad about him dumping so many corpses into his waters. These poems were composed for entertainment, not to accurately document what Bronze Age warfare was really like.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Painting of Achilleus fighting the god of the river Skamandros, a scene from Book Twenty-One of the </em>Iliad<em>, painted in 1737 by the French painter Charles-Antoine Coypel. The</em> Iliad <em>is primarily a work of fantasy, not of history.</em></p>



<p>Citing the<em> Iliad </em>and the <em>Odyssey</em> as evidence that archaic Greek culture was exceptionally violent is like citing modern violent films as proof that contemporary American society is exceptionally violent. Humans have <em>always</em> told stories involving graphic violence; we still tell stories involving graphic violence today and we will probably still be telling stories involving graphic violence in a thousand years. All that these stories prove is that humans in general have a fascination with stories of violence.</p>



<p>Pinker’s analysis of what life was like in ancient Greece relies heavily on Johnathan Gottschall, a literary scholar who, as best as I can tell, has no formal background in history or classical studies in particular. In the entire section, Pinker does not even reference a single ancient Greek historical source or a single classicist.</p>



<p>In response to the argument that ancient Greek warfare was generally less deadly than modern warfare because people in ancient Greece were fighting with spears and swords rather than with “machine guns, artillery, bombers, and other long-distance weaponry,” Pinker merely quotes a graphic description from Gottschall of people getting slaughtered with spears and dismisses the issue.</p>



<p>It baffles me that Pinker could somehow think this even constitutes an argument; one graphic description of slaughter from a modern literary critic based on the <em>Iliad</em>, a work of fiction, does not constitute as proof that a spear is as deadly as a machine gun.</p>



<p>Ironically, one piece of historical evidence that we can perhaps gather from the Homeric poems is that many of the original listeners of these poems had probably never seen an actual battle first-hand; the poet frequently describes men fighting using similes comparing them to everyday scenes from the natural world, especially of animals, which many scholars have suspected is because the poet was trying to conjure up images of what a battle might look like for those who had never seen one.</p>

<p>Now, of course, in historical reality, the ancient Greeks <em>were</em> capable of being quite violent, but I think Pinker’s portrayal leaves a rather significant misimpression of just how violent life in ancient Greece really was.</p>



<p>Archaic Greek warfare was much smaller-scale than modern warfare and, in most cases, probably resulted in a lot fewer deaths. Battles were usually rather small-scale, with armies most often being composed of only a few hundred men at most, and they were usually fought over land. It was not a common occurrence for a city to be sacked and burned like the …</p></div></div>

<p>Other posts in this series :</p><p>By now you should know about the EUJC ruling on the Privacy Shield. I am going to keep this one short and sweet - I believe the judgment to be more far-reaching than NOYB is explaining on their website. The reasoning is very simple.</p><p>To demonstrate this let's take a look at <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/EU-US_form_v3_nc.pdf" target="_blank">the questionnaire</a> that NOYB made available for companies.</p><p>The first question is :</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7o_3wla8Jk/XxnVR1tBoFI/AAAAAAAAA1w/EbNCVuVO_JEnpY0Uo7eNFDoyO_EBeTU5ACPcBGAYYCw/s775/schremms1.PNG"><img data-original-height="216" data-original-width="775" height="139" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7o_3wla8Jk/XxnVR1tBoFI/AAAAAAAAA1w/EbNCVuVO_JEnpY0Uo7eNFDoyO_EBeTU5ACPcBGAYYCw/w500-h139/schremms1.PNG" width="500"></a></p><div><p><span>We can stop right there. The problem is that for every US-based company that isn't solely working with Paper and pigeons only (and even then)&nbsp;</span><span>the answer is always <b>YES</b></span><span>. Your potential Data Processor in the USA is going to use Verizon / ATT / (you name it) and as such you will always have a data processor that is subject to FISA702 in the middle somewhere.&nbsp; As the leaks of Edward Snowden have clearly shown, Telcos are being used as an entry vector for mass surveillance. It is irrelevant whether or not your direct counterpart is subject to surveillance laws.</span></p><div><p>Let's continue regardless :</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aKG3-JexiLo/XxnWzcYvefI/AAAAAAAAA14/m3NJWaBCf1gMJARD5cit0j06Pw3B3-5AwCLcBGAsYHQ/s744/schrems2.PNG"><img data-original-height="250" data-original-width="744" height="169" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aKG3-JexiLo/XxnWzcYvefI/AAAAAAAAA14/m3NJWaBCf1gMJARD5cit0j06Pw3B3-5AwCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h169/schrems2.PNG" width="500"></a></p>
<div><p>Answer to 5a) is: <b>You can't </b>(Quote me on this - I know what I am talking about). There is no way to escape mass surveillance as a company in the US. You would have to build all of your communication channels on 0 knowledge type protocols. Even if they exist for your use case they are most likely not supported by other businesses you will have to communicate with, or by your remote workforce.&nbsp; You also need to consider other laws, such as "Export Restrictions" and "Anti-Money Laundering" also giving the US HQ access to a lot of information, sometimes even via a direct data pipe to the EU. (A vector that NOYB is forgetting about)</p></div><div><p>The companies that can confidently answer yes to the above may exist in some niche segments or some niche use cases. As an example - I hear you say "But we use TLS" - that's a pretty naive view and ridiculous protection against a nation-state adversary given capabilities and funding for mass surveillance by law.&nbsp;</p><p>So unless you can demonstrate that every digital communication is "unbreakable" by a nation-state you are still subjecting EU data subjects to mass surveillance. So even if you are using SCCs as a legal basis of transfer, unless you communicate via Pidgeons your SCCs can be challenged and likely aren't valid.&nbsp;</p></div><p>In other words, by the end of the NOYBs'&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/EU-US_form_v3_nc.pdf" target="_blank">&nbsp;questionnaire</a>, you will have understood that realistically you can't use SSCs as a means to legally transfer EU Personal data in 99.9% of the cases.&nbsp;</p><p>So what does that mean for <b>inter-company transfers to the US</b>? (Example: Apple Ireland to Apple US). Well, they are unlikely to come to the conclusion that they can't protect the data, and whoever sits on the button in Europe has been chosen to follow along with the logic of the US HQ (not just on that issue). Hint: The performance review within US Companies of EU employees is always done in the US at some level.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How can you spot that?</b> The Data Privacy Notice will somewhere say "<span>You agree that your personal data is shared within the group of companies</span>". That means you agree to transfer your data to the US. Want to object? Ask your DPA to enforce that the company can no longer transfer your personal data to the US. <span>You will see your account closed and your agreement terminated</span>. <b>Why?</b> I don't know any Big US company that would be able to offer the service without exchanging any personally identifiable (as defined in GDPR) information with the US at this point in time.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><img

    <p>One of the first things we did in setting up the company was create a repo
named "rfd." This repo houses our requests for discussion. Bryan teased this to
the internet...</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To the point of this piece, the first thing we actually built at <a href="https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oxidecomputer</a> was infrastructure for design documentation and discussion -- which, like many problems, is peskier than it might seem! <a href="https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I">https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I</a></p>— Bryan Cantrill (@bcantrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1286005213065703424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>...and folks asked for our process, so we are going to share it!</p>
<p>The best way to
describe RFDs is with "RFD 1 Requests for Discussion." Below is that RFD.</p>

<p>Writing down ideas is important:  it allows them to be rigorously formulated
(even while nascent), candidly discussed and transparently shared.
We capture the written expression of an idea in a <strong>Request for Discussion</strong>
(RFD), a document in the original spirit of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">IETF Request for Comments</a>,
as expressed by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions
or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and
explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a note is one sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative,
and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than
authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished,
and we hope to ease this inhibition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to RFCs, our philosophy of RFDs is to allow both timely discussion of
rough ideas, while still becoming a permanent repository for more established ones.
Depending on their state, RFDs may be quickly iterated on in a branch,
discussed actively as part of a pull request to be merged, or commented upon
after having been published.
The workflow for the RFD process for is based upon those of the Golang
proposal process, Joyent RFD process, Rust RFC process, and Kubernetes
proposal process.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-an-rfd">When to use an RFD</h2>
<p>The following are examples of when an RFD is appropriate, these are intended to
be broad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or change a company process</li>
<li>An architectural or design decision for hardware or software</li>
<li>Change to an API or command-line tool used by customers</li>
<li>Change to an internal API or tool</li>
<li>Change to an internal process</li>
<li>A design for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>RFDs not only apply to technical ideas but overall company ideas and processes
as well.
If you have an idea to improve the way something is being done as a company,
you have the power to make your voice heard by adding to discussion.</p>

<p>At the start of every RFD document, we'd like to include a brief amount of metadata.
The metadata format is based on the
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata">python-markdown2</a> metadata format.
It'd look like:</p>
<pre><code>---
authors: Andy Smith &lt;andy@example.computer&gt;, Neal Jones &lt;neal@example.computer&gt;
state: prediscussion
---
</code></pre>
<p>We keep track of three pieces of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>authors</code>: The authors (and therefore owners) of an RFD.
They should be listed with their name and e-mail address.</li>
<li><code>state</code>: Must be one of the states discussed below.</li>
<li><code>discussion</code>: For RFDs that are in or beyond the <code>discussion</code> state, this should be a link to the PR to integrate the RFD;
see below for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>An RFD can be in one of the following six states:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>prediscussion</code></li>
<li><code>ideation</code></li>
<li><code>discussion</code></li>
<li><code>published</code></li>
<li><code>committed</code></li>
<li><code>abandoned</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A document in the <code>prediscussion</code> state indicates that the work is not yet
ready for discussion, but that the RFD is effectively a placeholder.
The <code>prediscussion</code> state signifies that work iterations are being done
quickly on the RFD in its branch in order to advance the RFD to the <code>discussion</code> state.</p>
<p>A document in the <code>ideation</code> state contains only a description of the topic
that the RFD will cover, providing an indication of the scope of the eventual
RFD. Unlike the <code>prediscussion</code> state, there is no expectation that is
undergoing active revision. Such a document is scratchpad for related ideas.
Any member of the team is encouraging to start active development of such an
RFD (moving it to the prediscussion state) with or without the participation
of the original author. It is critical that RFDs in the <code>ideation</code> state are
clear and narrowly defined.</p>
<p>Documents under active discussion should be in the <code>discussion</code> state.
At this point a discussion is being had for the RFD in a Pull Request.</p>
<p>Once (or if) discussion has converged and the Pull Request is ready to be merged,
it should be updated to the <code>published</code> state before merge.
Note that just because something is in the <code>published</code> state does not mean that
it cannot be updated and corrected.
See the  <a href="#making-changes-to-an-rfd">Making changes to an RFD</a> section for more
information.</p>
<p>The <code>prediscussion</code> state should be viewed as essentially a collaborative
extension of an engineer's notebook, and the <code>discussion</code> state should be used
when an idea is being actively discussed.
These states shouldn't be used for ideas that have been committed to,
organizationally or otherwise;
by the time an idea represents the consensus or direction, it should be in
the <code>published</code> state.</p>
<p>Once an idea has been entirely implemented, it should be in the <code>committed</code> state.
Comments on ideas in the <code>committed</code> state should generally be raised as issues --
but if the comment represents a call for a significant divergence from or
extension to committed functionality, a new RFD may be called for;
as in all things, use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, if an idea is found to be non-viable (that is, deliberately never
implemented) or if an RFD should be otherwise indicated that it should be
ignored, it can be moved into the <code>abandoned</code> state.</p>
<p>We will go over this in more detail.
Let's walk through the life of a RFD.</p>
<h2 id="rfd-life-cycle">RFD life-cycle</h2>
<p>There is a <em>prototype</em> script in this repository, <code>scripts/new.sh</code>, that will
automate the process.</p>
<pre><code>$ scripts/new.sh 0042 "My title here"
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to create a new RFD by hand, or understand the process in greater
detail, read on.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Never at anytime through the process do you push directly to the
master branch. Once your pull request (PR) with your RFD in your branch is
merged into master, then the RFD will appear in the master branch.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-a-rfd-number">Reserve a RFD number</h3>
<p>You will first need to reserve the number you wish to use for your RFC.
This number should be the next available RFD number from looking at the
current <code>git branch -r</code> output.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-branch-for-your-rfd">Create a branch for your RFD</h3>
<p>Now you will need to create a new git branch, named after the RFD number you wish to reserve.
This number should have leading zeros if less than 4 digits.
Before creating the branch, verify that it does not already exist:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -rl *0042
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a branch there (but not a corresponding sub-directory in <code>rfd</code> in
master), it is possible that the RFD is currently being created;
stop and check with co-workers before proceeding!
Once you have verified that the branch doesn't exist, create it locally and
switch to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout -b 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-placeholder-rfd">Create a placeholder RFD</h3>
<p>Now create a placeholder RFD.
You can do so with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p rfd/0042
$ cp prototypes/prototype.md rfd/0042/README.md
# OR IF YOU PREFER asciidoc
$ cp prototypes/prototype.adoc rfd/0042/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the RFD number and title placeholders in the new doc and add your name as an author.
The status of the RFD at this point should be <code>prediscussion</code>.</p>
<p>If your preference is to use asciidoc, that is acceptable as well, however the examples in this flow will assume markdown.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Push your changes to your RFD branch in the RFD repo.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add rfd/0042/README.md
$ git commit -m '0042: Adding placeholder for RFD &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<p>After your branch is pushed, the table in the README on the master branch will
update automatically with the new RFD. If you ever change the name of the RFD in the future,
the table will update as well. Whenever information about the state of the RFD
changes, this updates the table as well. The single source of truth for
information about the RFD comes from the RFD in the branch until it is merged.</p>
<h3 id="iterate-on-your-rfd-in-your-branch">Iterate on your RFD in your branch</h3>
<p>Now, you can work on writing your RFD in your branch.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout 0042
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can gather your thoughts and get your RFD to a state where you would
like to get feedback and discuss with others.
It's recommended to push your branch remotely to make sure the changes you make
stay in sync with the remote in case your local gets damaged.</p>
<p>It is up to you as to whether you would like to squash all your commits down to
one before opening up for feedback, or if you would like to keep the commit
history for the sake of history.</p>
<h3 id="discuss-your-rfd">Discuss your RFD</h3>
<p>When you are ready to get feedback on your RFD, make sure all your local
changes are pushed to the remote branch.
At this point you are likely at the stage where you will want to change the
status of the RFD from <code>prediscussion</code> to <code>discussion</code> for a fully formed
RFD or to <code>ideation</code> for one where only the topic is specified.
Do this in your branch.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely-2">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Along with your RFD content, update the RFD's state to <code>discussion</code> in your branch, then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -am '0042: Add RFD for &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a Pull Request</h3>
<p>Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch, in this case <code>0042</code> into the master branch.</p>
<p>If you move your RFD into <code>discussion</code> but fail to open a pull request, a friendly
bot will do it for you. …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>Michael Isard, Derek Murray, and I recently sent in a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotos15">HotOS</a> submission (it’s not blind, so no harm talking about it, we think). The subject is hinted at from the post title (stolen from the paper title):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Big data systems may scale well, but this can often be just because they introduce a lot of overhead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than making your computation go faster, the systems introduce substantial overheads which can require large compute clusters just to bring under control.</p>

<p>In many cases, you’d be better off running the same computation on your laptop.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>Here is the set-up: we took several recent graph-processing publications from the systems community, and compared the measurements they report to simple single-threaded implementations running on my work laptop (RIP). We wrote competent implementations, but we didn’t obsess deeply over fancy algorithms, cunning data-dependent tweaks, or what have you. I’ll show you the code, and you decide.</p>

<p>We evaluated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> (20 iterations) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)">graph connectivity</a> on two graphs, <a href="http://an.kaist.ac.kr/traces/WWW2010.html">twitter_rv</a> and <a href="http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/uk-2007-05/">uk_2007_05</a>. We chose these algorithms and datasets mostly because a recent OSDI 2014 paper <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-gonzalez.pdf">GraphX</a> used exactly these to evaluate several of the top systems, and we wanted to borrow their numbers rather than try to reproduce them on systems we aren’t expert with.</p>

<p>As a caveat, these algorithms are quite specific to graph processing, and the data sets are not large (billions of edges, but still just a few gigabytes). Our conclusion is not that the systems we are going to look at are obviously bad, but rather that there is not yet much evidence that they are especially good.</p>

<p>The point we try to make in the HotOS submission is that evaluation of these systems, especially in the academic context, is lacking. Folks have gotten all wound-up about scalability, despite the fact that scalability is just a means to an end (performance, capacity). When we actually look at performance, the benefits the scalable systems bring start to look much more sketchy. We’d like that to change.</p>

<h2 id="measurements">Measurements</h2>

<p>All measurements other than the “single thread” lines are from the GraphX paper linked above. I’ll talk about the single-threaded implementations soon, but the results for the most direct implementations of PageRank and label propagation (the algorithm the systems use for graph connectivity) look like this:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr> <th>System</th> <th>cores</th> <th>twitter_rv</th> <th>uk_2007_05</th></tr>
<tr> <td>Spark</td> <td>128</td> <td>857s</td> <td>1759s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>Giraph</td> <td>128</td> <td>596s</td> <td>1235s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>GraphLab</td> <td>128</td> <td>249s</td> <td>833s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>GraphX</td> <td>128</td> <td>419s</td> <td>462s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>Single thread</td> <td>1</td> <td>300s</td><td>651s</td> </tr>
</tbody><caption>Twenty pagerank iterations</caption>
</table>
</center>



<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr> <th>System</th> <th>cores</th> <th>twitter_rv</th> <th>uk_2007_05</th></tr>
<tr> <td>Spark</td> <td>128</td> <td>1784s</td> <td>8000s+</td></tr>
<tr> <td>Giraph</td> <td>128</td> <td>200s</td> <td>8000s+</td></tr>
<tr> <td>GraphLab</td> <td>128</td> <td>242s</td> <td>714s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>GraphX</td> <td>128</td> <td>251s</td> <td>800s</td></tr>
<tr> <td>Single thread</td> <td>1</td> <td>153s</td><td>417s</td> </tr>
</tbody><caption>Label propagation to fixed-point (graph connectivity)</caption>
</table>
</center>


<p>These single-threaded numbers paint the scalable systems in a pretty dismal light. With 128x as many cores, none of the scalable systems consistently out-perform a single thread at PageRank, which is probably one of the simplest graph computations (sparse matrix-vector multiplications). The systems are almost a factor of two slower than the single-threaded implementation for label propagation.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is only going to get worse for the scalable systems as our investigation continues.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>Let’s talk a bit about what the implementations look like, so that we can figure out whether we are being totally unfair. First, the measurements were taken on a laptop I no longer possess. I’ve reproduced most of the code in <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> on my new laptop, and the results are mostly the same (some faster, some slower). The measurements above are from a C# implementation, so this isn’t a “Rust is super fasterest” issue. The code is available on GitHub, including both <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftResearch/NaiadSamples/tree/master/COST">the C# version</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/COST">the Rust version</a>.</p>

<p>The algorithms we are talking about are all based on iterative scans of the edges in a graph. To support these algorithms, we are going to produce a few implementations of the following trait:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> <span>EdgeMapper</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map_edges</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>FnMut</span><span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>map_edges</code> method is generic with respect to a closure. It’s a mouthful, but it means <code>action</code> can be called multiple times on inputs of type <code>(u32, u32)</code>,  edges, and may modify its environment. This will probably make more sense once we see it used.</p>

<p>One nice thing about Rust is that each closure corresponds to a new type <code>F</code>, and a new specialized instance of <code>map_edges</code>, inlining the <code>action</code> method. In C# I had to manually unroll some loops. Ew.</p>

<h3 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h3>

<p>Let’s look at how PageRank gets implemented with respect to such a trait:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>pagerank</span><span>&lt;</span><span>G</span><span>:</span> <span>EdgeMapper</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>graph</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>G</span><span>,</span> <span>nodes</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>alpha</span><span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I’m not going to say very much about whether this is a good pagerank implementation. There are <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.5449">better versions</a>, but everyone uses this algorithm for benchmarking
to ensure they are measuring their system’s performance, not the algorithm’s. This is textbook PageRank, no bells, no whistles.</p>

<p>Label propagation is basically just as simple. For those of you unfamiliar with the algorithm, each node maintains a label, and repeatedly improves it by asking their neighbors if they have a smaller label. This is run until convergence, at which point all nodes in the same component have the same label.</p>

        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>These are pretty simple implementations. No tricks. Let’s look at how we implement an <code>EdgeMapper</code>.</p>

<h3 id="edgemapper-implementation">EdgeMapper implementation</h3>

<p>Our first EdgeMapper implementation will be based on an adjacency list representation, which we will just map into memory and iterate over. There will be a smarter one later on.</p>

<p>We’ll assume we have two files, <code>graph.nodes</code> and <code>graph.edges</code>, where</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>graph.nodes</code> contains a sequence of <code>(u32, u32)</code> pairs representing <code>(node_id, degree)</code>.</li>
  <li><code>graph.edges</code> contains a sequence of <code>u32</code> values representing edge endpoints.</li>
</ul>

<p>To enumerate the edges, we iterate through <code>graph.nodes</code>, where for each <code>(node_id, degree)</code> pair we read <code>degree</code> values from <code>graph.edges</code> and then pair each with <code>node_id</code> to form an edge.</p>

<p>Ignoring the <code>TypedMemoryMap</code> for the moment (it’s 32 lines of wrapper around Rust’s <code>MemoryMap</code>),
the mapper structure and its implementation of <code>EdgeMapper</code> are:</p>

<p>That’s all! (except for the <code>TypedMemoryMap</code> type, available in the repository).</p>

<h2 id="getting-smarter">Getting smarter</h2>

<p>Perhaps the single-threaded implementations above are a bit too simple. There are some very easy modifications that result in significantly improved performance. Remember how the simple single-threaded implementations were on-par with or maybe slightly better than the scalable systems? Here are the improved results using smarter algorithms (still from my old laptop and C#):</p>

<tr> <td>Single thread (smarter)</td> <td>1</td> <td>15s</td><td>30s</td> </tr>
</tbody><caption>Label propagation to fixed-point (graph connectivity)</caption>
</table>
</center>



<p>There are two types of improvement, processing edges in different orders and using better algorithms, that put the single-threaded implementations so far ahead of the scalable systems.</p>

<h3 id="different-data-layout">Different data layout</h3>

<p>The edge order used above processes all edges from one vertex before moving to the next vertex. Notice that neither of the algorithms need this to hold to be correct. A different ordering, one which exhibits much better cache locality, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert curve</a> ordering. Informally, it is like ordering edges (x,y) by the interleaving of the bits of x and y: you trade the great locality in the x coordinates to upgrade the poor locality in the y coordinate. You get (good, good) locality instead of (great, poor).</p>

<p>Visually, we can think of ordering pairs (x,y) as drawing a continuous line (a space-filling curve) through a 2d square. An initially square region is decomposed into four squares, each of which will be filled completely before moving to the next square. Notice that the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3 moves only to adjacent squares. The process is applied recursively within each square to order elements within, and even at the finer granularity the movements are only to adjacent squares, even when moving between squares at the coarser granularity. The ordering (curve) we produce is continuous, and very localized.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.frankmcsherry.org/assets/hilbert.png" alt="My helpful screenshot"></p>

<p>The Hilbert implementation of <code>EdgeMapper</code> is similar to our prior implementation, with some minor layout changes. We start from two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>graph.upper</code> contains a sequence of <code>((u16, u16), u32)</code> values, each a 65536x65536 square indicating the upper 16 bits of x and y, followed by the number of edges in the square. These entries are ordered by the order their corresponding squares are visited by the curve.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I have to tell you about the Kalman filter, because what it does is pretty damn amazing.</p>
<p>Surprisingly few software engineers and scientists seem to know about it, and that makes me sad because it is such a general and powerful tool for <strong>combining information</strong> in the presence of uncertainty. At times its ability to extract accurate information seems almost magical— and if it sounds like I’m talking this up too much, then take a look at <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/improving-imu-attitude-estimates-with-velocity-data">this previously posted video</a> where I demonstrate a Kalman filter figuring out the <em>orientation</em> of a free-floating body by looking at its <em>velocity</em>. Totally neat!</p>

<p>You can use a Kalman filter in any place where you have <strong>uncertain information</strong> about some dynamic system, and you can make an <strong>educated guess</strong> about what the system is going to do next. Even if messy reality comes along and interferes with the clean motion you guessed about, the Kalman filter will often do a very good job of figuring out what actually happened. And it can take advantage of correlations between crazy phenomena that you maybe wouldn’t have thought to exploit!</p>
<p>Kalman filters are ideal for systems which are <strong>continuously changing</strong>. They have the <span id="more-491"></span>advantage that they are light on memory (they don’t need to keep any history other than the previous state), and they are very fast, making them well suited for real time problems and embedded systems.</p>
<p>The math for implementing the Kalman filter appears pretty scary and opaque in most places you find on Google. That’s a bad state of affairs, because the Kalman filter is actually super simple and easy to understand if you look at it in the right way. Thus it makes a great article topic, and I will attempt to illuminate it with lots of clear, pretty pictures and colors. The prerequisites are simple; all you need is a basic understanding of probability and matrices.</p>
<p>I’ll start with a loose example of the kind of thing a Kalman filter can solve, but if you want to get right to the shiny pictures and math, feel free to <a href="#mathybits">jump ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s make a toy example: You’ve built a little robot that can wander around in the woods, and the robot needs to know exactly where it is so that it can navigate.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png" alt="Your little robot" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest-300x160.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_forest.png 553w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>We’ll say our robot has a state \( \vec{x_k} \), which is just a position and a velocity:</p>
<p>\(\vec{x_k} = (\vec{p}, \vec{v})\)</p>
<p>Note that the state is just a list of numbers about the underlying configuration of your system; it could be anything. In our example it’s position and velocity, but it could be data about the amount of fluid in a tank, the temperature of a car engine, the position of a user’s finger on a touchpad, or any number of things you need to keep track of.</p>
<p>Our robot also has a GPS sensor, which is accurate to about 10 meters, which is good, but it needs to know its location more precisely than 10 meters. There are lots of gullies and cliffs in these woods, and if the robot is wrong by more than a few feet, it could fall off a cliff. So GPS by itself is not good enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png"><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png" alt="Oh no." width="300" height="283" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes-300x283.png 300w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/robot_ohnoes.png 403w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>We might also know something about how the robot moves: It knows the commands sent to the wheel motors, and its knows that if it’s headed in one direction and nothing interferes, at the next instant it will likely be further along that same direction. But of course it doesn’t know everything about its motion: It might be buffeted by the wind, the wheels might slip a little bit, or roll over bumpy terrain; so the amount the wheels have turned might not exactly represent how far the robot has actually traveled, and the prediction won’t be perfect.</p>
<p>The GPS <strong>sensor</strong> tells us something about the state, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy. Our <strong>prediction</strong> tells us something about how the robot is moving, but only indirectly, and with some uncertainty or inaccuracy.</p>
<p>But if we use all the information available to us, can we get a better answer than <strong>either estimate would give us by itself</strong>? Of course the answer is yes, and that’s what a Kalman filter is for.</p>


<p>Let’s look at the landscape we’re trying to interpret. We’ll continue with a simple state having only position and velocity. $$<br>
\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}<br>
p\\<br>
v<br>
\end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>We don’t know what the <em>actual</em> position and velocity are; there are a whole range of possible combinations of position and velocity that might be true, but some of them are more likely than others:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png" alt="gauss_0" width="310" height="325" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_0-287x300.png 287w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>The Kalman filter assumes that both variables (postion and velocity, in our case) are random and <em>Gaussian distributed.</em> Each variable has a <strong>mean</strong> value \(\mu\), which is the center of the random distribution (and its most likely state), and a <strong>variance</strong> \(\sigma^2\), which is the uncertainty:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png" alt="gauss_1" width="310" height="276" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_1-300x267.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>
<p>In the above picture, position and velocity are <strong>uncorrelated</strong>, which means that the state of one variable tells you nothing about what the other might be.</p>
<p>The example below shows something more interesting: Position and velocity are <strong>correlated</strong>. The likelihood of observing a particular position depends on what velocity you have:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png" alt="gauss_3" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_3-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">This kind of situation might arise if, for example, we are estimating a new position based on an old one. If our velocity was high, we probably moved farther, so our position will be more distant. If we’re moving slowly, we didn’t get as far.</p>
<p>This kind of relationship is really important to keep track of, because it gives us <strong>more information: </strong>One measurement tells us something about what the others could be. And that’s the goal of the Kalman filter, we want to squeeze as much information from our uncertain measurements as we possibly can!</p>
<p>This correlation is captured by something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrix</a>. In short, each element of the matrix \(\Sigma_{ij}\) is the degree of correlation between the <em>ith</em> state variable and the <em>jth</em> state variable. (You might be able to guess that the covariance matrix is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix">symmetric</a>, which means that it doesn’t matter if you swap <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>). Covariance matrices are often labelled “\(\mathbf{\Sigma}\)”, so we call their elements “\(\Sigma_{ij}\)”.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png" alt="gauss_2" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2.png 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_2-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></p>

<p>We’re modeling our knowledge about the state as a Gaussian blob, so we need two pieces of information at time \(k\): We’ll call our best estimate \(\mathbf{\hat{x}_k}\) (the mean, elsewhere named \(\mu\) ), and its covariance matrix \(\mathbf{P_k}\). $$<br>
\begin{equation} \label{eq:statevars}<br>
\begin{aligned}<br>
\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\text{position}\\<br>
\text{velocity}<br>
\end{bmatrix}\\<br>
\mathbf{P}_k &amp;=<br>
\begin{bmatrix}<br>
\Sigma_{pp} &amp; \Sigma_{pv} \\<br>
\Sigma_{vp} &amp; \Sigma_{vv} \\<br>
\end{bmatrix}<br>
\end{aligned}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>(Of course we are using only position and velocity here, but it’s useful to remember that the state can contain any number of variables, and represent anything you want).</p>
<p>Next, we need some way to look at the <span><strong>current state</strong></span> (at time <span><strong>k-1</strong></span>) and <strong>predict the <span>next state</span></strong> at time <span><strong>k</strong></span>. Remember, we don’t know which state is the “real” one, but our prediction function doesn’t care. It just works on <em>all of them</em>, and gives us a new distribution:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg" alt="gauss_7" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_7-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">We can represent this prediction step with a matrix, \(\mathbf{F_k}\):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg" alt="gauss_8" width="310" height="286" srcset="https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8.jpg 621w, https://www.bzarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gauss_8-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">It takes <em>every point</em> in our original estimate and moves it to a new predicted location, which is where the system would move if that original estimate was the right one.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this. How would we use a matrix to predict the position and velocity at the next moment in the future? We’ll use a really basic kinematic formula:$$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + \Delta t &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In other words: $$<br>
\begin{align}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}<br>
1 &amp; \Delta t \\<br>
0 &amp; 1<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \label{statevars}<br>
\end{align}<br>
$$</p>
<p>We now have a <strong>prediction matrix</strong> which gives us our next state, but we still don’t know how to update the covariance matrix.</p>
<p>This is where we need another formula. If we multiply every point in a distribution by a matrix \(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}\), then what happens to its covariance matrix \(\Sigma\)?</p>
<p>Well, it’s easy. I’ll just give you the identity:$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
Cov(x) &amp;= \Sigma\\<br>
Cov(\color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}x) &amp;= \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}} \Sigma \color{firebrick}{\mathbf{A}}^T<br>
\end{split} \label{covident}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<p>So combining \(\eqref{covident}\) with equation \(\eqref{statevars}\):$$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{P}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F_k} \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{P}_{k-1}} \mathbf{F}_k^T<br>
\end{split}<br>
\end{equation}<br>
$$</p>
<h2>External influence</h2>
<p>We haven’t captured everything, though. There might be some changes that <strong>aren’t related to the state</strong> itself— the outside world could be affecting the system.</p>
<p>For example, if the state models the motion of a train, the train operator might push on the throttle, causing the train to accelerate. Similarly, in our robot example, the navigation software might issue a command to turn the wheels or stop. If we know this additional information about what’s going on in the world, we could stuff it into a vector called \(\color{darkorange}{\vec{\mathbf{u}_k}}\), do something with it, and add it to our prediction as a correction.</p>
<p>Let’s say we know the expected acceleration \(\color{darkorange}{a}\) due to the throttle setting or control commands. From basic kinematics we get: $$<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{p_k} &amp;= \color{royalblue}{p_{k-1}} + {\Delta t} &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp;\frac{1}{2} \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}^2 \\<br>
\color{deeppink}{v_k} &amp;= &amp;\color{royalblue}{v_{k-1}} + &amp; \color{darkorange}{a} {\Delta t}<br>
\end{split}<br>
$$ In matrix form: $$<br>
\begin{equation}<br>
\begin{split}<br>
\color{deeppink}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_k} &amp;= \mathbf{F}_k \color{royalblue}{\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{k-1}} + \begin{bmatrix}<br>
\frac{\Delta t^2}{2} \\<br>
\Delta t<br>
\end{bmatrix} \color{darkorange}{a} \\<br>
&amp;= \mathbf{F}_k …</p></div></div>

    <p>Recently I came across a special binary that was compiled to run on a fixed, well-defined set of modern computer hardware. This rather large binary performs many physics simulations via floating-point computations, emitted strictly as instructions from Intel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">Advanced Vector Extensions</a> (AVX).</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a> has excellent support decompiling ‘legacy’ SSE (floating-point) instructions, it makes no effort to generate higher level pseudocode for AVX instructions. In this post, we will demonstrate how the Hex-Rays decompiler can be extended to support new or otherwise unsupported instructions using the microcode API.</p>

<p>The practical application of this research has been packaged and released as a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/gaasedelen/microavx">MicroAVX</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-hex-rays-microcode">The Hex-Rays Microcode</h2>

<p>In 2018, Hex-Rays <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/news/7_1/">released</a> IDA Pro 7.1. This was the first version of IDA to expose the decompiler’s internal microcode. This gave researchers access to richer forms of analysis (dataflow, value/type speculation) and the ability to augment the logic of the decompiler at a much lower level than previously possible.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><a href="https://blog.ret2.io/assets/img/avx_ida_microcode.png" data-lightbox="avx_ida_microcode.png" data-title="The Hex-Rays microcode makes up a RISC-like intermediate language">
    
      <img src="https://blog.ret2.io/assets/img/avx_ida_microcode.png" alt="">
    
    </a></p><p>The Hex-Rays microcode makes up a RISC-like intermediate language</p>
    
</div>

<p>The Hex-Rays microcode is an intermediate language (IL). Like most IL’s, its purpose is to provide a portable and architecture-agnostic platform suitable for program analysis. By lifting compiled code to an intermediate language, Hex-Rays can apply a generic set of rules and analysis algorithms to decompile code from any architecture.</p>

<p>At this point, there are a number of existing resources that discuss the Hex-Rays microcode and its implementation in great detail [<a href="https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Guilfanov-Decompiler-Internals-Microcode-wp.pdf">1</a>] [<a href="https://blog.amossys.fr/stage-2019-hexraysmicrocode.html">2</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-YkhNElvng">3</a>] [<a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/blog/microcode-in-pictures/">4</a>] so we will simply move on to the problem at hand.</p>

<h2 id="unsupported-external-instructions">Unsupported ‘External’ Instructions</h2>

<p>Out of the box, the Hex-Rays x64 decompiler does not support AVX instructions. This is not unreasonable, because AVX usage is still relatively rare. When present, most applications include both SSE (legacy) and AVX (modern) versions of the relevant functions to ensure compatibility with CPU’s that predate AVX (2011).</p>

<p>Since the decompiler does not know how to ‘lift’ AVX instructions to the Hex-Rays microcode, the pseudocode will simply inline their assembly. Sometimes this is okay, but other times it can be rather confusing, if not misleading:</p>

<div>
    
    <p><a href="https://blog.ret2.io/assets/img/avx_inline_asm_split.png" data-lightbox="avx_inline_asm_split.png" data-title="Two seperate examples of the Hex-Rays decompiler inlining unsupported AVX instructions">

    </a></p><p>Two seperate examples of the Hex-Rays decompiler inlining unsupported AVX instructions</p>
    
</div>

<p>To take a look under the hood of the decompiler, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/patois/genmc">genmc</a> plugin. This plugin makes it easy to inspect the Hex-Rays microcode at various stages of the decompilation pipeline. This tool is highly recommended, if not necessary for developing effectively on the microcode API.</p>

<p>Inspecting the microcode for the AVX functions shown above, we can see that the decompiler emits a micro-instruction called <code>ext</code> to indicate an ‘external’ instruction that it does not know how to handle.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><a href="https://blog.ret2.io/assets/img/avx_microcode_ext.png" data-lightbox="avx_microcode_ext.png" data-title="The Hex-Rays microcode denotes 'unsupported' instructions using the 'ext' micro-opcode">

    </a></p><p>The Hex-Rays microcode denotes 'unsupported' instructions using the 'ext' micro-opcode</p>
    
</div>

<p>With the help of a small <a href="https://github.com/gaasedelen/microavx/blob/master/misc/scrape.py">script</a>, we can dump every instruction from the database that the decompiler cannot lift. This is done by asking the microcode API to generate the initial microcode for each function, and scraping out any ‘external’ instructions from the generated microcode.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><a href="https://blog.ret2.io/assets/img/avx_dump_ext.gif" data-lightbox="avx_dump_ext.gif" data-title="Scraping all the unsupported instructions from the database">

    </a></p><p>Scraping all the unsupported instructions from the database</p>
    
</div>

<p>The script collects some stats, telling us there are 121 unsupported instructions used by 8148 unique functions. It also dumps out an ordered listing of the unsupported instructions based on how many unique functions use each one. This will help us prioritize which instructions we should focus on lifting first.</p>

<h2 id="hooking-microcode-generation">Hooking Microcode Generation</h2>

<p>The Hex-Rays SDK (and more specifically, <code>hexrays.hpp</code>) is the best source of information for developing microcode or decompiler based extensions. Within this header file we found that Hex-Rays documents a convenient mechanism to perform what they call non-standard microcode generation:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// Generic microcode generator class.
/// An instance of a derived class can be registered to be used for
/// non-standard microcode generation. Before microcode generation for an
/// instruction all registered object will be visited by the following way:
///   if ( filter-&gt;match(cdg) )
///     code = filter-&gt;apply(cdg);
///   if ( code == MERR_OK )
///     continue;     // filter generated microcode, go to the next instruction
</span><span>struct</span> <span>microcode_filter_t</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>/// check if the filter object is to be appied
</span>  <span>/// \return success
</span>  <span>virtual</span> <span>bool</span> <span>match</span><span>(</span><span>codegen_t</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>cdg</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

  <span>/// generate microcode for an instruction
</span>  <span>/// \return MERR_... code:
</span>  <span>///   MERR_OK      - user-defined call generated, go to the next instruction
</span>  <span>///   MERR_INSN    - not generated - the caller should try the standard way
</span>  <span>///   else         - error
</span>  <span>virtual</span> <span>merror_t</span> <span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>codegen_t</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>cdg</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The SDK states that by implementing a microcode filter, we can receive callbacks as the decompiler is generating the microcode for each instruction that falls within a decompilation request. This is an ideal place for us to install a custom lifter that will help the decompiler ‘fill in the blanks’ at the lowest level.</p>

<p>Using the python microcode bindings, we can start building out a simple lifter by subclassing <code>microcode_filter_t</code>. The following template demonstrates how we can cleanly map an unsupported instruction of interest (eg, <code>vxorps</code>) to a function that will be dedicated to lifting that instruction:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>AVXLifter</span><span>(</span><span>ida_hexrays</span><span>.</span><span>microcode_filter_t</span><span>):</span>

        """</span>
        <span>pass</span> <span># TODO: lift the 'vxorps' instruction</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Since we are hooking the decompiler’s initial code generation phase, we are able to ‘get in on the ground floor’. This means that the microcode generated by our lifter will get to ride upwards through the entire analysis and optimization pipeline that makes up the decompiler.</p>

<p>Not only are we extending the decompiler to support new instructions, but we will get to take full advantage of the powerful analysis that Hex-Rays will layer on top of it. In the next section, we will walk through the process of lifting one AVX instruction to the Hex-Rays microcode.</p>

<h2 id="lifting-vxorps">Lifting ‘vxorps’</h2>

<p>For this example, we will be lifting the AVX instruction <code>vxorps</code> as it is quite simple. We will be using details <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xorps">scraped</a> from the Intel PDFs to help us understand the semantics of the instruction and lift it to the Hex-Rays microcode.</p>

<p>Copy pasting from the link above, we can roughly summarize <code>vxorps</code> to the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>VXORPS xmm1, xmm2, xmm3/m128
VXORPS ymm1, ymm2, ymm3/m256

[vxorps] performs a bitwise logical XOR of the [four or eight] packed single-precision
floating-point values from the first source operand and the second source operand,
and stores the result in the destination operand ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As part of the decompiler’s codegen callback, we are provided with a <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/ida_ua.insn_t-class.html">decoded</a> instance of the <code>vxorps</code> instruction. The following python snippet shows how we can start to break down the decoded instruction as part of the translation to Hex-Rays microcode:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>def</span> <span>vxorps</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cdg</span><span>,</span> <span>insn</span><span>):</span>
        <span>"""
        VXORPS xmm1, xmm2, xmm3/m128
        VXORPS ymm1, ymm2, ymm3/m256
        """</span>

        <span># determine if this is a 128bit operation, or 256bit operation</span>
        <span>op_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>XMM_SIZE</span> <span>if</span> <span>is_xmm_reg</span><span>(</span><span>insn</span><span>.</span><span>Op1</span><span>)</span> <span>else</span> <span>YMM_SIZE</span>

        <span># op3 -- m128/m256</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>is_mem_op</span><span>(</span><span>insn</span><span>.</span><span>Op3</span><span>):</span>
            <span>r_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>cdg</span><span>.</span><span>load_operand</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>

        <span># op3 -- xmm3/ymm3</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>r_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>ida_hexrays</span><span>.</span><span>reg2mreg</span><span>(</span><span>insn</span><span>.</span><span>Op3</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span><span>)</span>

        <span># ...</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Since the third operand to <code>vxorps</code> can vary between a register or memory load, we must lift them differently based on their type. A ‘processor register’ can easily be converted to a ‘microcode register’ using the function <code>reg2mreg()</code>, whereas <code>load_operand()</code> can be used to automatically transform a memory operand into a ‘temporary’ register.</p>

<p>After translating <code>Op1</code> and <code>Op2</code> using the same functions as described above, we are ready to emit a micro-instruction for the explicit ‘XOR’ operation performed by <code>vxorps</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>        <span># ... </span>

        <span># op2 -- xmm2/ymm2</span>
        <span>l_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>ida_hexrays</span><span>.</span><span>reg2mreg</span><span>(</span><span>insn</span><span>.</span><span>Op2</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span><span>)</span>

        <span># op1 -- xmm1/ymm1</span>
        <span>d_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>ida_hexrays</span><span>.</span><span>reg2mreg</span><span>(</span><span>insn</span><span>.</span><span>Op1</span><span>.</span><span>reg</span><span>)</span>

        <span># emit 'd_reg = l_reg ^ r_reg'</span>
        <span>cdg</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>(</span><span>ida_hexrays</span><span>.</span><span>m_xor</span><span>,</span> <span>op_size</span><span>,</span> <span>l_reg</span><span>,</span> <span>r_reg</span><span>,</span> <span>d_reg</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

        <span># ...</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using the codegen object is the easiest way to emit new micro-instructions. In this example, we ask the codegen to emit the micro-instruction <code>m_xor</code> for us, passing it our three lifted micro-registers as its operands.</p>

<p>The structure of each micro-instruction is unique, and well-defined by the <code>mcode_t</code> enum in the Hex-Rays SDK header <code>hexrays.hpp</code>. In addition, there are more advanced (and flexible) methods to emit microcode as documented by the SDK, but they will not be covered here.</p>

<p>Putting everything together, this is what our completed lifter looks like for the <code>vxorps</code> instruction:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>def</span> <span>vxorps</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cdg</span><span>,</span> <span>insn</span><span>):</span>
        <span>"""
        …</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

      <h2>Machine Learning Examples</h2>
        <p>After you're familiar with the <a href="https://gradio.app/getting_started">basics of Gradio library</a>, you'll probably want to try it on a machine
          learning model. Let's see Gradio working with a few machine learning examples.</p>
      <h3>Image Classification in Tensorflow / Keras <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NWE_SDgQPI6GIpnhtWeEOHCPejC2FaZc?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">
        </a></h3>
      <p>
        We'll start with the Inception Net image classifier, which we'll load
          using Tensorflow! Since this is an image classification model, we
          will use the <code>Image</code> input interface. We'll output a
          dictionary of labels and their corresponding confidence scores
          with the <code>Label</code> output interface. (The original
          Inception Net
          architecture <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842" target="_blank">can be found here</a>)
      </p>

      <pre><code>import gradio as gr
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import requests

inception_net = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3() # load the model

# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet.
response = requests.get("https://git.io/JJkYN")
labels = response.text.split("\n")

def classify_image(inp):
  inp = inp.reshape((-1, 299, 299, 3))
  inp = tf.keras.applications.inception_v3.preprocess_input(inp)
  prediction = inception_net.predict(inp).flatten()
  return {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}

image = gr.inputs.Image(shape=(299, 299, 3))
label = gr.outputs.Label(num_top_classes=3)

gr.Interface(fn=classify_image, inputs=image, outputs=label, capture_session=True).launch()</code></pre>
      <p>This code will produce the interface below. The interface gives you a way to test
      Inception Net by dragging and dropping images, and also allows you to use naturally modify the input image using image editing tools that
          appear when you click EDIT. Notice here we provided actual <code>gradio.inputs</code> and <code>gradio.outputs</code> objects to the Interface
          function instead of using string shortcuts. This lets us use built-in
          preprocessing (e.g. image resizing)
          and postprocessing (e.g. choosing the number of labels to display) provided by these
            interfaces. Finally, we use <code>capture_session=True</code> to ensure compatibility with TF 1.x.

      <h3>Answering Questions with BERT-QA
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RuiMJz_7jDXpi59jDgW02NsBnlz1aY1S?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"></a></h3>

      <p>What if our model takes more than one input? Let's wrap a 2-input to 1-output interface around BERT-QA,
        a model that can <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05017" target="_blank">answer general questions</a>.
        As shown in the code, Gradio can wrap functions with multiple inputs or outputs, simply by taking the list of
        components needed.
        The number of input components should match the number of parameters taken by <code>fn</code>. The number of
        output components should match the number of values returned by <code>fn</code>. Similarly, if a model
        returns multiple outputs, you can pass in a list of output interfaces.</p>
      <pre><code>import gradio as gr
from bert import QA

model = QA('bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad')

def qa_func(context, question):
    return model.predict(context, question)["answer"]

gr.Interface(qa_func,
    [
        gr.inputs.Textbox(lines=7, label="Context"),
        gr.inputs.Textbox(label="Question"),
    ],
    gr.outputs.Textbox(label="Answer")).launch()</code></pre>
      <p> This code will produce the interface below.</p>

      <p>
        Many models have numeric or categorical inputs, which we support with a variety of interfaces. Let's wrap multiple input to label interface around a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic" target="_blank"> Titanic survival model</a>. We've hidden some of model-related code below, but you can see the full code on colab.
      </p>
      <pre><code>import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sklearn

def predict_survival(sex, age, fare):
    df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({'Sex': [sex], 'Age': [age], 'Fare': [fare]})
    df = encode_sex(df)
    df = encode_fares(df)
    df = encode_ages(df)
    pred = clf.predict_proba(df)[0]
    return {'Perishes': pred[0], 'Survives': pred[1]}

sex = gr.inputs.Radio(['female', 'male'], label="Sex")
age = gr.inputs.Slider(minimum=0, maximum=120, default=22, label="Age")
fare = gr.inputs.Slider(minimum=0, maximum=1000, default=100, label="Fare (british pounds)")

gr.Interface(predict_survival, [sex, age, fare], "label", live=True).launch()</code></pre>

        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861" target="_blank">MobileNet</a>.

<p>A meta post introducing my solutions to the fantastic <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">excellent second edition</a> of “Statistical
Rethinking” by <a href="https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath">Richard McElreath</a>, a.k.a. Statistical Rethinking². Also discusses strategies to keep up with the material, mostly meant for self-study groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/rethinking-r-nix/">detailed previously</a>, I recently was part of a course centered around Bayesian modeling for the Icelandic COVID-19 pandemic. The Bayesian mindset needs no introduction, and this post is completely inadequete to explain why anyone should be interested (that’s what the book is for!). That said, especially for self-paced study groups, it might help to have some structure.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>These are meant to be sample solutions, and everyone <strong>should</strong> solve these for themselves. Each solution contains the packages used, as well as a colophon in the later posts to ensure reproduciblity.
Essentially this consists of four posts:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/sr2-ch2-ch3-ch4/">Week I</a></dt>
<dd>Covers the first four chapters {1,2,3,4}</dd>
<dt><a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/sr2-ch5-ch6-ch7/">Week II</a></dt>
<dd>Covers the next three chapters {5,6,7}</dd>
<dt><a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/sr2-ch9-ch11-ch12/">Week III</a></dt>
<dd>Covers five chapters {9,11,12}</dd>
<dt><a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/sr2-ch13-ch14">Week IV</a></dt>
<dd>The last five chapters {13,14}</dd>
</dl>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    

<p>In this post I will discuss some testing techniques for internal red teams to identify privacy issues in services and infrastructure, most importantly a simple three step approach that might uncover interesting results.</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background story</h2>

<p>First, let me share a story from the past. When I did my master’s I built an app that performs end to end encryption of Facebook posts. This means that only the intended audience for which your posts were encrypted for can decipher the posts.</p>

<p>The project was called Project Cryptbook, and I found an old screnshot again:</p>

<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/cryptbook.png" alt="Project Cryptbook"></a></p>

<p>On the left you see the UI in the app which shows the clear text. And on the right, you see what everyone else, including Facebook sees.</p>

<p>That was about 10+ years ago - interesting how time flies. Facebook replaced the “wall” with an ad-driven timeline and Windows Phone is dead.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I have always been a fan of privacy, data protection and giving user’s control over their data.</p>

<h2 id="red-teaming-for-privacy">Red Teaming for privacy!</h2>

<p>When years later I oversaw planning and performing large red team operations I thought quite a bit on how to help organizations improve their understanding of privacy threats with practical excersices. It became even more interesting when new regulations started kicking in.</p>

<p><strong>Does your organization have procedures in place to regularly assess systems and infrastructure for privacy violations?</strong></p>

<p>Article 32 of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/?qid=1528874672298&amp;uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> highlights the requirement and necessity to test regularly when processing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even for privacy minded folks and organizations, there is little information available on how to perform privacy testing nor is there much literature out there (to my knowledge). Chances are you might have not even thought about privacy focused testing before.</p>

<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/gdpr.png" alt="GDPR Logo"></a></p>

<p>Let’s dive into the threats of data and motivated intruder.</p>

<h2 id="data-intruder-threat">Data Intruder Threat</h2>

<p>Privacy violations are often insider threats. Employees who have access to production and PII data can easily exfiltrate large amounts of data or be coerced into doing so by an adversary.</p>

<p>In more mature organizations such access is only granted on a case-by-case basis and temporarily for support, debugging or when security incidents arise. And access to the systems and data records is <em>(should be)</em> monitored thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="easy-access-to-customer-data">Easy access to customer data?</h3>

<p>How difficult is it for a developer, a marketing person, support personnel, a data scientist, or someone from HR to access customer data?</p>

<p><strong>Are access requests possibly auto-approved!?</strong></p>

<p>The data intruder threat is important as more and more of the world’s data is being stored in the cloud. Insiders indeed exploit their privileges at times, for instance: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-cyber-access-exclusive-idUSKCN24O34E">Twitter (2020)</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-investigating-claim-engineer-used-access-stalk-women-n870526">Facebook (2018)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-fired-security/">Google (2010)</a>.</p>

<p>How is the situation in your organization?</p>

<p>Ideally, customers should be notified whenever employees or contractors access their information through support, maintenance, or bug fixes. That would set a high standard for ethics in the industry.</p>

<p>What safeguards are in place to prevent anyone from downloading the customer database, copying it onto a USB device to exfiltrate, sell the information, or take it home when departing the company?</p>

<h2 id="motivated-intruder">Motivated Intruder</h2>

<p>Furthermore, NIST highlights the <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> as being an internal adversary who has access to <strong>anonymized datasets and uses data science techniques to <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/sp/800-188/archive/2016-08-25/documents/sp800_188_draft.pdf">reidentify and deanonymize the data</a></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/hacker.png" alt="Hacker"></p>

<p>I have been using the term <strong>Motivated Intruder</strong> in a broader sense for any privacy focused red teaming operations throughout my career.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-privacy-focused-testing">Getting started with privacy focused testing</h2>

<p>There are some basic ways to test and identify privacy violations in your organization.</p>

<p>Here are a couple ideas for operations, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</strong>. For various reasons PII might end up accidentally in widely accessible telemetry, source code, logs, event streams, shared email inboxes, data science notebooks,…</li>
<li><strong>Simulate a Data Intruder who can legitimately gain access to customer data for business purposes</strong> and exfiltrate sentinel records to validate monitoring solutions</li>
<li><strong>Exploit a system vulnerability</strong> or weakness to gain access to customer data</li>
<li>Perform <strong>de-anonymization attacks</strong> - teaming up with data scientists during red team operations</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post I will be focusing on the first two scenarios.</p>

<p>Discuss with compliance and legal teams before engaging with them to ensure you have a well-rounded and authorized test plan in place.</p>

<h2 id="scenario-1-identifying-customer-data-in-widely-accessible-locations">Scenario 1: Identifying customer data in widely accessible locations</h2>

<p>I am a fan of creating sentinel datasets and have the red team find and exfiltrate those as objective.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/background.filler.png" alt="background"></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-sentinel-record">What is a sentinel record?</h3>

<p>A sentinel data record is basically a test record, often with an easily identifiable pattern.</p>

<p>Sentinel data records are useful for privacy focused testing. One way to get basic end-to-end test coverage is to use your own systems as an external user:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data creation with unique patterns</strong> - Sign up with a unique and easily identifiable pattern as PII</li>
<li><strong>Exercising features</strong> of the system under test - Then exercise and use all the features of the system to trigger various workflows internally</li>
<li><strong>Hunting for patterns in internal systems</strong> - Finally, switch hats and search internally in widely accessible places for that <strong>unique pattern</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-does-this-work-practically">How does this work practically?</h3>

<p>Let’s say your organization runs a service that allows users to register with their first name, last name, address, and credit card, and users can upload text and comments. Let’s walk through a test scenario step by step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-data-creation-with-unique-easily-identifiable-patterns">Step 1: Data creation with unique, easily identifiable patterns</h3>

<p>In a practical fashion, this could be as simple as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>As username, pick <strong>John55444562200</strong> <strong>Tester55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The address could be <strong>Test Road55444562200</strong></li>
<li>Credit card contains <strong>55444562200</strong> as well</li>
<li>Phone number contains  <strong>55444562200</strong></li>
<li>The email address contains it, for instance <strong>johntester+55444562200</strong>@example.org</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You get the idea!</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-2-exercising-features">Step 2: Exercising features</h3>

<p>After creating test data, use the system and its features. Consider triggering side conditions and error cases to get a wide range of test cases. Upload/post/edit/delete information in the same using the pattern <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to automate and leverage already existing test frameworks to become more repeatable and have better test coverage.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-hunting-phase">Step 3: Hunting phase</h3>

<p>Afterward, it is time to hunt for the <em>specific</em> string pattern - in this case for <strong>55444562200</strong>.</p>

<p>This means searching various data stores and widely accessible information repositories for the pattern that used during signup.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/lookfor.png" alt="Searching"></p>

<p>At this stage there is <strong>no</strong> need to actively compromise systems - ideally you just define a scope of systems to analyze upfront. Searching widely accessible <strong>telemetry stores</strong> and <strong>supposedly anonymized datasets in data lakes</strong> is a good place to start.</p>

<p>Some surprise hits might also be visible in places like <strong>internal source code repositories</strong> - maybe a data scientists checks in customer data when building or analyzing models, and of course our very own <strong>security monitoring solutions</strong> might contain the pattern as well. Other places are <strong>Intranet portals</strong>, <strong>file servers</strong> and <strong>O365/SharePoint/GSuite</strong>.</p>

<p>Using this simple technique, it’s possible to raise awareness and identify potential privacy violations and improve the overall security posture. It also helps protect the organization from certain data intruder threats.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also do a privacy hunt without creating sentinel records. For instance searching for regular expression of phone numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers can help identify sensitive datasets in widely exposed locations pretty quickly.</p>

<h3 id="scenario-2-malicious-insider-and-privacy-implications">Scenario 2: Malicious insider and privacy implications</h3>

<p>When troubleshooting issues and debugging purposes, as well as security investigations, it is likely that engineers in your organization can request access to production machines where they might be exposed to customer data. In less mature organizations the process might be even simpler - and the question is if auditing is taking place. This is an important angle to validate as a red team.</p>

<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/number.png" alt="Numbers"></p>

<p>What if someone legitimately gains that level of access to debug a performance problem but at the same time exfiltrates customer data on a production system?</p>

<p>Would the blue team detect that? Is there enough logging in place to figure out what happened?</p>

<p>The actual data to exfiltrate can again be sentinel production records. This is to avoid having the red team touch real customer data – which is always preferable. Although, as a safety pre-caution red teamer must have proper authorization if they get exposed to customer data during testing (and yes, red teams have to be audited also). Discuss your testing objectives and approach with your legal counsel to ensure its legitimate and authorized.</p>

<p><strong>In the end, I think that an organization has to engage in privacy testing to help protect customer data and to demonstrate adhering to privacy regulation.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post we discussed how Red Teams can help identify privacy violations by performing motivated intruder testing. We also learned about the Data Intruder and walked through some basic test techniques to help identify and minimize risk associated with accidently leaking customer data.</p>

<p>Hope this was interesting and useful. If you kick off such tests in your organization, I’d be curious to learn about findings or other approaches and ideas you might have.</p>

Scientists handling the infectious virus must wear full-body biohazard suits with pressurized respirators, and work inside laboratories with multiple containment levels and specialized ventilation systems.&nbsp;</p><p>While necessary to protect laboratory workers, these safety precautions slow down efforts to find drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 since many scientists lack access to the required biosafety facilities.</p><p>To help remedy that, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have developed a hybrid virus that will enable more scientists to enter the fight against the pandemic. The researchers genetically modified a mild virus by swapping one of its genes for one from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The resulting hybrid virus infects cells and is recognized by antibodies just like SARS-CoV-2, but can be handled under ordinary laboratory safety conditions.</p><p>The study is available online in <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.chom.2020.06.021&amp;t=MWMwZmRmZDkzZTBhZDRhYzdiOGJhZDE5MDBmOTdiZWU2MDA3NzQ4YixURjc5VDBHRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624545995186995200%2Flab-made-virus-mimics-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1595866633">Cell Host &amp; Microbe</a></i>.</p><p>“I’ve never had this many requests for a scientific material in such a short period of time,” said co-senior author Sean Whelan, PhD, the Marvin A. Brennecke Distinguished Professor and head of the Department of Molecular Microbiology. “We’ve distributed the virus to researchers in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada and, of course, all over the U.S. We have requests pending from the U.K. and Germany. Even before we published, people heard that we were working on this and started requesting the material.”</p><p>To create a model of SARS-CoV-2 that would be safer to handle, Whelan and colleagues - including co-senior author Michael S. Diamond, MD, PhD, the Herbert S. Gasser Professor of Medicine, and co-first authors Brett Case, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Diamond’s laboratory, and Paul W. Rothlauf, a graduate student in Whelan’s laboratory - started with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This virus is a workhorse of virology labs because it is fairly innocuous and easy to manipulate genetically. Primarily a virus of cattle, horses and pigs, VSV occasionally infects people, causing a mild flu-like illness that lasts three to five days.</p><p>Viruses have proteins on their surfaces that they use to latch onto and infect cells. The researchers removed VSV’s surface-protein gene and replaced it with the one from SARS-CoV-2, known as spike. The switch created a new virus that targets cells like SARS-CoV-2 but lacks the other genes needed to cause severe disease. They dubbed the hybrid virus VSV-SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Using serum from COVID-19 survivors and purified antibodies, the researchers showed that the hybrid virus was recognized by antibodies very much like a real SARS-CoV-2 virus that came from a COVID-19 patient. Antibodies or sera that prevented the hybrid virus from infecting cells also blocked the real SARS-CoV-2 virus from doing so; antibodies or sera that failed to stop the hybrid virus also failed to deter the real SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a decoy molecule was equally effective at misdirecting both viruses and preventing them from infecting cells.</p><p>“Humans certainly develop antibodies against other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but it’s the antibodies against spike that seem to be most important for protection,” Whelan said. “So as long as a virus has the spike protein, it looks to the human immune system like SARS-CoV-2, for all intents and purposes.”</p><p>The hybrid virus could help scientists evaluate a range of antibody-based preventives and treatments for COVID-19. The virus could be used to assess whether an experimental vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies, to measure whether a COVID-19 survivor carries enough neutralizing antibodies to donate plasma to COVID-19 patients, or to identify antibodies with the potential to be developed into antiviral drugs.</p><p>“One of the problems in evaluating neutralizing antibodies is that a lot of these tests require a BSL-3 facility, and most clinical labs and companies don’t have BSL-3 facilities,” said Diamond, who is also a professor of molecular microbiology, and of pathology and immunology. “With this surrogate virus, you can take serum, plasma or antibodies and do high-throughput analyses at BSL-2 levels, which every lab has, without a risk of getting infected. And we know that it correlates almost perfectly with the data we get from bona fide infectious SARS-CoV-2.”</p><p>Since the hybrid virus looks like SARS-CoV-2 to the immune system but does not cause severe disease, it is a potential vaccine candidate, Diamond added. He, Whelan and colleagues are conducting animal studies to evaluate the possibility.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Flab-made-virus-mimics-covid-19-virus%2F&amp;t=M2Y3YjJiN2FiMDJjNGQ1YTMzMmZmM2I3MWVjYWRiNDM5ZmRiN2QxNCxURjc5VDBHRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624545995186995200%2Flab-made-virus-mimics-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1595866633">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Neutralizing antibody and soluble ACE2 inhibition of a replication-competent VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2.”,&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.chom.2020.06.021&amp;t=MWMwZmRmZDkzZTBhZDRhYzdiOGJhZDE5MDBmOTdiZWU2MDA3NzQ4YixURjc5VDBHRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624545995186995200%2Flab-made-virus-mimics-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1595866633"><i>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</i></a>.</p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/613074141882564608/covid19-symptoms">COVID-19 symptoms explained (motion graphic)</a></p>

        <p>If you’ve heard the news about the nRF9160 then you know it’s a game-changer. ARM Cortex M33 + LTE Cat-M + NB-IoT and GPS all included under one System in Package. Drool-worthy, right?</p>

<p>Well, if you’ve been using the nRF SDK to build nRF5x projects, you likely feel like you’re hanging from your toes. That’s because Nordic has chosen to adopt Zephyr as their RTOS of choice for the nRF9160.</p>

<p>Although there is <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/">plenty of documentation about Zephyr</a>, making the transition can still be tough. Many nRF SDK enthusiasts will find themselves lost in a sea of CMake files and Kconfigs. I’m here to help with that!</p>

<p>This is the guide I wish existed while I was developing some drivers for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf91-feather/">nRF9160 Feather</a>. I spent weeks getting accustomed to how Zephyr worked, figuring out what files needed to be where, and how the heck to include a header file. (Fun times.)</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, I’ll go over some of the nuances related to creating drivers for your peripherals on Zephyr. We’ll talk about Device Tree organization, <code>Kconfig</code>, and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files. By the end, you should have an idea on how to tackle your own Zephyr driver aspirations!

<h2 id="example-walkthrough">Example Walkthrough</h2>

<p>In this example, you’ll learn about what it takes to create a driver for the PCF85063A real-time clock and counter. I’ve chosen to use the counter API for reasons we’ll discuss in a bit. There are some prerequisites to getting started though. Let’s begin with SDK Setup.</p>

<h3 id="sdk-setup">SDK Setup</h3>

<p>I’ll be referencing Nordic’s nRF Connect SDK a bunch throughout this post. I’ve been building and testing nRF9160 Feather on v1.3.0. I won’t be going into detail on how to set up the SDK though. Nordic has <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html">great documentation</a> you can check out to get started. I’ve also discussed <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/zephyr-on-nrf9160-feather/">my experience here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-west-can-do-for-you">What <code>west</code> can do for you</h3>

<p>The Zephyr project uses a CLI tool, <code>west</code>, for project management, compilation, and flashing. <code>west</code> replaces the idea of a top-level Makefile and project dependency management like Git submodules. For the most part, it accomplishes that goal well.</p>

<p>You’ll need to install <code>west</code> if you haven’t already. Follow the SDK setup links above for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>To build a project, navigate to the directory for the application in question and run <code>west build</code>. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cd </span>ncs/nrf/samples/nrf9160/nrf_cloud_agps
<span>$</span><span> </span>west build <span>-b</span> circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns <span>-p</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This builds in the current folder for the <code>circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160ns</code> board. You can find all the possible <code>arm</code> based boards in <code>ncs/zephyr/boards/arm/</code> The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>west</code> to clean before building.</p>

<p>A ton of things happen in the background to build a project. We’ll discuss more how things compile in the next section.</p>

<p><strong>Flashing</strong></p>

<p>Flashing code is as simple as running <code>west flash</code> from your project directory. You can use the <code>-r</code> parameter to choose which programming method you’d like to use. Common options are <code>jlink</code>, <code>nrfjprog</code> (for Nordic projects), <code>pyocd</code>, <code>openocd</code>, <code>dfu-util</code>, etc.</p>

<p>These “runners” are set in the board configuration. Here’s the <code>board.cmake</code> for the nRF9160 Feather located in <code>zephyr/boards/arm/circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160/board.cmake</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>board_runner_args</span><span>(</span>nrfjprog <span>"--nrf-family=NRF91"</span><span>)</span>
<span>board_runner_args</span><span>(</span>jlink <span>"--device=cortex-m33"</span> <span>"--speed=4000"</span><span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>ZEPHYR_BASE</span><span>}</span>/boards/common/nrfjprog.board.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span><span>${</span><span>ZEPHYR_BASE</span><span>}</span>/boards/common/jlink.board.cmake<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/boards/arm/circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160/board.cmake">Original Github code here</a>)</p>

<p>As you can see, the nRF9160 Feather supports the <code>nrfjprog</code> and <code>jlink</code> options.</p>

<h2 id="dependency-management">Dependency Management</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways of handling dependencies in firmware land. I’ve used Git submodules as my dependency “manager” of choice. Zephyr though, is very opinionated on how you should work with your dependencies. Let’s look into how we do that with <code>west</code> and a <code>west.yml</code> file.</p>

<p><code>west.yml</code> is a manifest file much like a <code>Cargo.toml</code> in rust or <code>package.json</code> for Node. You initialize a Zephyr repository using <code>west init</code> command. This does a shallow <code>git</code> clone for each dependency and puts them into place.</p>

<p>Here’s what a <code>west.yml</code> file may look like. This was for a personal project that uses <a href="https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb">NanoPB</a> and also the nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>manifest</span><span>:</span>
  <span>remotes</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nrfconnect</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>url-base</span><span>:</span> <span>https://github.com/nanopb</span>
  <span>projects</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nrf</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nrfconnect</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>v1.3.0</span>
      <span>import</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>repo-path</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
      <span>revision</span><span>:</span> <span>0.3.9</span>
      <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas/ext/nanopb</span>
      <span>remote</span><span>:</span> <span>nanopb</span>
  <span>self</span><span>:</span>
    <span># This repository should be cloned to ncs/nrf.</span>
    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>pyrinas</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>west.yml</code> file doesn’t affect driver operation. If you’re going to include your drivers as a separate repo though, this is where you would add it! You can learn more though by going to the Zephyr documentation on <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.14.1/guides/west/manifest.html">West Manifests</a>. (complete with crazy dependency diagrams and more!)</p>

<h2 id="how-things-compile">How Things Compile</h2>

<p>One of the important things to know about driver development is how things compile. It may bend your mind a bit but we’ll get through this together.</p>

<h3 id="cmakeliststxt"><code>CMakeLists.txt</code></h3>

<p>If you spend enough time in Zephyr, you may see some patterns emerge. Many folders and sub-folders have this dynamic duo: <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> and <code>Kconfig</code>. These files are where all the magic happens.</p>

<p>You may already have an idea of what <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> does by its name. It’s a Makefile of sorts that you use to add source files and include folders to a project. The neat thing about <code>cmake</code> is that it’s recursive (for better or for worse). This means a higher-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file spells out what, if anything, can be found in subdirectories. There are no more ginormous Makefiles. You make the changes you need closest to the code that’s affected.</p>

<p>For example, you can add subdirectories in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so they’re part of the <code>cmake</code> path:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Point to NCS root directory.</span>
<span>set</span><span>(</span>NRF_DIR <span>${</span><span>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR</span><span>}</span> CACHE PATH <span>"NCS root directory"</span><span>)</span>

<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/extensions.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/multi_image.cmake<span>)</span>
<span>include</span><span>(</span>cmake/reports.cmake<span>)</span>

<span>zephyr_include_directories</span><span>(</span>include<span>)</span>

<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>ext<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>lib<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>samples<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>subsys<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>drivers<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory</span><span>(</span>tests<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes they’re used to set the directory as a project. This particular one is from the <code>https_client</code> example in nRF Connect SDK.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cmake_minimum_required</span><span>(</span>VERSION 3.8.2<span>)</span>

<span>find_package</span><span>(</span>Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE}<span>)</span>
<span>project</span><span>(</span>https_client<span>)</span>

<span>target_sources</span><span>(</span>app PRIVATE src/main.c<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my case, I’ll show you how I used several <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so the compiler knows about my device drivers!</p>

<h3 id="kconfig"><code>Kconfig</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> allows you to create project-based configuration parameters. If you’ve ever used Nordic’s Original SDK, you know the pain of their <code>sdk_config.h</code> file. <em>It’s a nightmare.</em></p>

<p>Like <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, <code>Kconfig</code> files allow you to keep the configuration as close to your code. There’s no massive top-level configuration manifest to be afraid of. You can add your code without breaking the repository. Good stuff, right?</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a <code>Kconfig</code> from the <code>ncs/nrf/applications/asset_tracker</code> application</p>

<div><div><pre><code>menu "Asset tracker"

rsource "src/ui/Kconfig"

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE
    int "Application workqueue stack size"
    default 4096

config APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY
    int "Application workqueue priority"
    default SYSTEM_WORKQUEUE_PRIORITY

menu "GPS"
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that it references separate <code>Kconfig</code> files as a dependency. You can also see that some environment variables are set with default values. You can either add them to your project’s <code>prj.conf</code> <em>or</em> edit them using <code>west build -t menuconfig</code>. If you’re looking to make permanent changes, you should use the <code>prj.conf</code> method.</p>

<p>The most important part about <code>Kconfig</code> files in regards to drivers is that you can use these variables as flags for conditional compilation.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s what the <code>ncs/nrf/drivers/sensor/CMakeLists.txt</code> looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_BH1749 bh1749<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_SENSOR_SIM sensor_sim<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PMW3360 pmw3360<span>)</span>
<span>add_subdirectory_ifdef</span><span>(</span>CONFIG_PAW3212 paw3212<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may notice that all the variables begin with <code>CONFIG_</code>. All variables produced by <code>Kconfig</code> have this prefix. So, for example, <code>APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE</code> becomes <code>CONFIG_APPLICATION_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE.</code></p>

<p>In the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> above, you can see that a subdirectory is only added if the driver is “enabled”. <code>CONFIG_BH1749</code> happens to be the top-level environment variable to make that happen. You can also use this type of conditional compilation for your project code.</p>

<h3 id="zephyrmoduleyml"><code>zephyr/module.yml</code></h3>

<p><code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeList.txt</code> are great, but where do we start? How does <code>west</code> know where to start looking for them?</p>

<p>The answer is a very unsuspecting file called <code>module.yml</code>. <code>module.yml</code> is usually found in the <code>/zephyr</code> subdirectory of a dependency. For example, here’s the one for nRF Connect SDK located in <code>ncs/nrf/zephyr/</code></p>

<p>Example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>build:
  cmake: .
  kconfig: Kconfig.nrf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file tells <code>west</code> where to find the appropriate base <code>Kconfig</code> and <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. Those are the starting point for further repository traversal. Without these, there’s no way to use your driver code in your application!</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-drivers-folder">Adding a drivers folder</h2>

<p>You now should understand <code>Kconfig</code>, <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, and <code>module.yml</code>. We’re ready for driver development!</p>

<p>In my case, since my driver work is ongoing, I opted to use my own <code>drivers</code> folder in my main project repository. You can always opt to start developing your drivers in <code>zephyr/drivers</code>. This is likely a better location especially if you want to release the driver for others to use. The downside is that it requires more work!</p>

<p>In my case, here’s …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Over the course of the last week, the idea of universal basic income (“UBI”) has gained support from prominent politicians including Mitt Romney, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (yes, she is still running for the Democratic nomination). They and others believe that UBI can be one of the most effective ways for us to relieve some of the economic challenges which are presenting themselves to millions of people all across America in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and all of the associated impacts created by necessary social distancing.</p>



<p>Andrew Yang should be given a ton of credit for effectively legitimizing this concept as a result of his presidential campaign which ended just a little over a month ago. His signature policy which he called<em> <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/">The Freedom Dividend</a></em> proposed a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for every American adult. I remember the first time I heard Andrew talk about it at length with Joe Rogan on <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/e/58746566">Joe’s podcast</a> about a year ago. I had heard of the concept before that but was convinced of its merit for the first time that day.</p>



<p>The concept of UBI is not new. The idea was raised in some form or another by the founding fathers, Thomas Paine, and even Martin Luther King, Jr. who said,<q> “I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.”</q> </p>



<p>More recently, in 2017 the concept gained support from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg while the year before that Obama said, “we’ll be debating unconditional free money over the next 10 or 20 years.” My speculative prediction if you had asked me a few months ago would have been generally in line with Obama’s, that we might see some form of UBI come to fruition in the USA in the next two or three presidents. Today, I think chances are we very well may see it in the next two or three weeks. This is one of the positives that I believe will come from the tragic pandemic that the world is battling right now.</p>



<p>While universal basic income will help a lot of people now in the midst of this crisis, the more common argument prior to these unforeseen events was that it would be needed to counter joblessness as a result of accelerating automation. Andrew’s example using truck drivers was what first caught my attention because I recognize that most of these jobs will be replaced by autonomous vehicles in the next few years and, as Andrew points out, there are over 3 million truck drivers in The United States today. That represents about 2% of all US workers. More generally speaking, Andrew’s website cites McKinsey in suggesting that up to 1/3 American workers will lose their jobs to automation by 2030. His answer is universal basic income. The argument is not that $1,000 per month is enough to live your normal life, but that it is enough for humans to satisfy their basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. Maybe it is not even enough for that just yet, but it is hard to argue that it would not meaningfully help those who need it most today, and those who will need it most when, not if, they lose their jobs to automation.</p>



<p>The best argument for and explanation of universal basic income that I have found is in Albert Wenger’s book, <em><a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/part-three/economic">World After Capital</a></em>. He calculates that a UBI which pays $1,000/month to adults (18 years and older), $400/month for teens (12 years and older), and $200/month for children (younger than 12) would cost about $3 trillion per year. This, of course, is not a trivial amount of money by any means, but if you consider that <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/901853/feds-15-trillion-intervention-explained">The Federal Reserve injected $1.5 trillion into the economy last week</a>, and that by Albert’s calculations his proposed form of UBI would increase tax revenues by another $0.7 trillion, you realize that those two sources alone (summing to $2.2 trillion) would just about cover the cost of instituting UBI as per Albert’s proposal for the rest of the year ($2.25 trillion to cover 9 months from April through December 2020). That is all without touching the government’s existing annual budgets under normal circumstances, which of course would need to be a part of the equation to sustain any sort of UBI model in the long-term.</p>



<p>If you are interested in learning more about universal basic income, I highly recommend you listen to the Joe Rogan Podcast with Andrew Yang and read the “Economic Freedom” section in Part 3 of Albert Wenger’s book, both of which are linked above. </p>



<p>It seems silly for me most days to be writing about things that are not somewhat related to all that is going on in the world today. After all, I spend a lot of my time trying to understand how the world works and what the future holds, and those are the kinds of things I most enjoy writing about. That said, I am decidedly going to try to write about some positives that I see coming from all of this, precisely because they are so much harder for me to see than the negatives. I believe in the utility of positivity, so long as it does not serve to excuse irresponsibility (i.e. “everything will be OK <em>sooo </em>I am going to throw a party and invite everyone I know”). One of those positives I believe will be a temporary institution of UBI in the US, leading to a more general acceptance of the concept, significantly increased favorability ratings for it, and accelerated progress towards its implementation in perpetuity. </p>



<p>In a world with so much excess, everyone should have enough money to cover basic human needs.</p>

    <p>Society moves in waves.  It always starts with lots of separate things. Then they get bundled. After a while, more and more people start to realize that the bundled solution is too bloated and not specific enough for their needs. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/5/21/office-messaging-and-verbs">This is when an unbundling happens.</a></p>

<p>Unbundlings always represent a multitude of business opportunities. Below I’ll list several examples of unbundlings that have happened in the past, some that are happening right now, and a few speculations on what might be unbundled next.</p>

<p>While going through the following examples, ask yourself:  What aspect hasn’t been unbundled yet? What could be unbundled in a better way?</p>

<p>Now that we have some understanding of how unbundlings look like in practice, it’s time to ask: what’s the next big thing that will get unbundled?</p>

<p>A few suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twitter? (Especially its DM function, e.g., along the lines of what Earn.com tried. But also the “News-Feed” aspect, the “Life-Updates” aspect, the RSS-Feed aspect, etc.)</li>
  <li>Ebay? Amazon? (See Etsy, Shopify)</li>
  <li>Offices? (See Slack, Zoom, <a href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate</a>, <a href="https://wip.chat/">WIP.chat</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear on <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter</a> what unbundlings you’ve observed in the past and which you predict for the future!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout-marketing"><section><div> <p><i>by</i> <span>Joe Marshall</span> <i>on</i> <span>July 23, 2020</span></p> <p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/atlas-header.png"></p></div> <div><h2 id="intro-to-stripe-atlas">Intro to Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas is a <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">“platform for forming a company”</a> aimed in particular at startups and internet businesses. It consolidates a lot of the legal paperwork, fees, and hassle of incorporating a business, giving you access to a bevy of Stripe resources for company formation, all behind an online dashboard that sits inside your usual Stripe account. It costs $500 and covers a few hundred dollars in legal fees, plus it comes with thousands of dollars in credits with affiliated partners.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe Atlas offers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof your company is incorporated - papers, Tax ID, etc  </li>
<li>Stripe account  </li>
<li>Business checking account with Azlo Banking (optional, more on this later)  </li>
<li>Access to the Stripe Atlas community  </li>
<li>A year of registered agent fees (required for Delaware Corps, normally $100/year)</li>
<li>Off-the-shelf legal templates created by Stripe Atlas-affiliated lawyers</li>
<li>Special offers from vendors ($5,000 in AWS credits, $10,000 in Digital Ocean, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Stripe Atlas was designed initially for businesses that wanted to incorporate as Delaware C Corporations, it’s been expanded to support LLCs - meaning that if you don’t want to issue stock, have a Board of Directors, etc, but just want the legal framework for some shared profit venture, with the liability protection of an LLC, Stripe Atlas is still for you.</p>
<p>A major feature of Atlas, finally, is that it optionally comes with a business bank account. Access to the US banking system is a killer feature for international entrepreneurs who might want to process payments, sell / purchase companies, or otherwise participate in the American market.</p>
<p><strong>So, Stripe Atlas is for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrepreneurs who want to simplify the incorporation process  </li>
<li>Startup Founders  </li>
<li>Bootstrappers / Indiehackers / Side Project-ers  </li>
<li>International Entrepreneurs who want to do business in the US</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-we-chose-stripe-atlas">Why <em>We</em> Chose Stripe Atlas</h2>
<p>We’re a <a href="https://formcake.com/about">small, four-person bootstrapped business</a> (basically, bullet points one and three). We knew and trusted Stripe as our payment processor and loved the idea of not only consolidating a lengthy, involved process into a tool we (already!) used, we also saw the $500 fee as more than worth it, considering the promised $5,000 in AWS credits, registered agent fees, and incorporation fee. The ability to create a business bank account in addition to the incorporation was gravy, considering that we needed a business-only Stripe-connected account. For us, since all we required was a garden-variety, digitally-oriented LLC formation with the ultimate company divided into four ownership units, Atlas made perfect sense. If our needs hadn’t been so simple and we’d ultimately needed something more custom, we still would’ve explored Stripe Atlas’ premade templates and flat-fee legal services, but more cautiously.</p>
<h2 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h2>
<p>In order to get approved for a Stripe Atlas account and a Delaware C Corporation, you’ll need to provide some information to Stripe for <em>each person</em> who’s going to be a part owner of the company:</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo of your driver’s license</li>
<li>Driver’s license number</li>
<li>Driver’s license expiration</li>
<li>Physical address</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you submit this info Stripe will hit you with a whole mess of emails asking you to Docusign everything from an IP Assignment, which assigns any intellectual property you might have created to the company, to the actual paperwork dividing stock if you’re a Delaware C Corp or ownership units if you’re an LLC. It’s all very direct and automated, signing each stage of documents and providing the requisite information unlocks the next stage of documents and info-gathering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong>: We signed up and submitted all our personal info<br><strong>Day 3</strong>: A mistake! We noticed in our Stripe Atlas dashboard that the status of our documents was no longer "Submitted." We notified them, resubmitted some things, and they rectified the error.<br><strong>Day 6</strong>: We receive the company formation documents: IP assignment, ownership percentages, etc.<br><strong>Day 10</strong>: We received our bank account with Azlo but still couldn’t accept payment (trying to process one would trigger an error through the Stripe API)<br><strong>Day 14</strong>: We receive our EIN (Employer Identification Number), otherwise known as our tax ID. We can now accept payments!</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-aws-credits">Stripe Atlas AWS Credits</h2>
<p>Stripe Atlas teases a number of partner benefits in their promotional copy - $5,000 for AWS, up to $100,000 for GCP (!). Of course our all-AWS infrastructure makes those AWS credits essentially free money, so we were very interested in maximizing that benefit.</p>
<p>So after signing up for Atlas and going through all the AWS rigamarole we were able to secure only $1,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">posted about it</a> and actually received a follow up from Stripe:</p>
<section>
Hi David, 

<p>Thanks for your interest in Stripe Atlas. My name is Tony and I’ll be happy to share further about our tools.</p>
<p>We know that building a new business is exciting and challenging—but it can also be costly. To help you get off to a great start, Stripe Atlas has partnered with Amazon Web Services to create some great offers for Stripe Atlas businesses.</p>
<p>In your case, applying through Stripe Atlas, the amount you're eligible for is (up to) $5000. The "up to" phrase is because there is a lifetime eligibility cap.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions about AWS benefits or Stripe Atlas, just reply to this email—we're happy to help.       </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Tony</p>
</section>

<p>In summary: It seems that though Stripe can advertise the "up to" amounts it’s the actual partners (like AWS) who are setting the standards for what companies merit what credit payouts. Basically, Stripe directs you to AWS, you verify you’re a Stripe customer via a code, and the Amazon Gods pay what they pay.</p>
<p>It seems in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> (the program giving the credits) we signed up under the "Bootstrapped / Self-funded" option to get our $1,000 in credits. Maybe if we'd signed up as a "Funded" startup we could've expected the full $5,000?</p>
<p>It’s disappointing and a little opaque, but no more than most marketing copy. Just keep in mind as you’re reading those credit totals in the official Stripe Atlas documentation that they come with light asterisks - it’s not ultimately Stripe awarding those amounts.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-atlas-taxes">Stripe Atlas Taxes</h2>
<p>We have been incorporated for under a fiscal year, so alas we haven’t had the pleasure of doing taxes yet. We have done some research into it though, and tried to get a sense of what support Stripe offers Atlas companies during tax time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of some of the Stripe communication around taxes. These resources all came in an email to Atlas founders:</p>
<section>
Taxes &amp; Legal <br>
- Tax season ends July 15. <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/official-stripe-atlas-2020-tax-thread/11361">Get answers to your questions.</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/guidance-on-extension-of-time-to-file-w-irs-c-corp-no-revenue/13511">“I’m looking for guidance on how to apply for an extension with the IRS.”</a><br>
- <a href="https://discuss.stripe.community/t/should-i-pay-taxes-again/13738">“I paid taxes four months ago. I just got an email saying I have to pay again.”</a>
</section>

<h2 id="azlo-banking-option">Azlo Banking Option</h2>
<p>We decided to create a business checking account with Azlo because we desperately needed to move off my-real-live-checking-account we naturally shipped with.</p>
<p>We haven’t done anything exciting from a financial perspective - no complicated M&amp;A’s, accounting logistics, or large business loans - we’ve just been depositing money from our Stripe account and occasionally withdrawing.</p>
<p>One neat feature of using Azlo + Atlas is that when you’re activating your Stripe account, moving beyond the testing stage and generating a live production token, as soon as Stripe gives you a valid token you’re ready to accept payments - immediately. It’s a great feeling adding that critical Stripe token to your secrets management, pushing it live, and knowing someone can “walk up”, purchase your digital product, and pay you money for it, all completely automated. This is admittedly a small thing but also indicative of some of that Stripe attention to detail they’re so great about.</p>
<h2 id="our-conclusion">Our Conclusion</h2>
<p>Really the only blemish on our entire Stripe Atlas experience was wanting that sweet $5,000 in AWS credits but settling for $1,000 - which feels like a pretty small, spoiled gripe. Having the central location for everything company incorporation-related in our Stripe dashboard - where we’re already comfortable - and small things like document and personal info checklists, only having to pay a single entity (Stripe) instead of a million small fees, along with just having the whole thing on rails, makes Atlas a great proposition.</p>
<h2 id="other-stripe-resources">Other Stripe Resources</h2>
<p>Here are a few resources we’ve found useful. They run the gamut from the official sources for some of the technologies we’ve mentioned to particularly good community discussions around common issues.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    
<p>Some time ago I had the goal to implement a web application to be able to write what I’m speaking automatically and allow to execute actions through my voice commands. I thought it was a good idea to provide a way to listen to some feedback from the application too. After doing quick research I discovered a couple of Web APIs to solve this problem.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain how you can use modern Web APIs to add the nice capability to speak to your web application and allow it to respond to you. We will implement the app from scratch.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://luixaviles.com/assets/images/posts/web-speech/web-speech-api-no-text.jpg">
</figure>
<h3 id="what-is-an-api">What is an API?</h3>
<p>API is the acronym for <em>Application Programming Interface</em>. According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction">MDN</a> website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APIs are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simple words, APIs provide a <em>way</em> to create complex applications without having to learn or implement the details.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://luixaviles.com/assets/images/posts/api-diagram.png">
    <figcaption>API Diagram - Camera example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s describe an example, you just bought a camera and you only need to press buttons to <em>turn-on</em>, <em>turn-off</em>, <em>activate the Bluetooth</em>, and <em>start recording</em>. As you can see, we’re talking about a device that has a complex circuit that involves sensors, lenses, power management, and other details. You don’t need to work through these wiring or manage the circuit itself.</p>
<h3 id="web-apis">Web APIs</h3>
<p>Have you ever used <em>fetch</em> or a <em>Service Worker</em>? Maybe you used or accessed the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> from JavaScript?</p>
<p>Well, you can accomplish complex tasks based on those features since they are part of an extensive list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>. These APIs are not part of JavaScript, however, you can use them through this programming language(or any other JavaScript-based library/framework).</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may need to make sure a Web API is fully supported by your web browser before to start building an application based on it. For example, if you are planning to work with <em>fetch</em>, you can see what browsers or JavaScript engines <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=fetch">support it</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-speech-api">The Web Speech API</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="https://luixaviles.com/assets/images/posts/web-speech/speech-recognition.png">
  <figcaption>Speech Recognition through the Web Speech API</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see in the previous image, this Web API can help you with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate speech-to-text output</li>
<li>Uses speech recognition as input</li>
<li>Supports continuous dictation(You can write a complete letter)</li>
<li>Control interface for web browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, please see the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/">Web Speech API</a> specification.</p>

  <img src="https://luixaviles.com/assets/images/posts/web-speech/speech-synthesis.png">
  <figcaption>Text to Speech through the SpeechSynthesis interface</figcaption>

<p>You got the idea with the above image. The <em>Web Speech Synthesis</em> interface can generate a text-to-speech output.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/#tts-section">specification</a> to learn more about this interface.</p>

  </p>
  <figcaption>Demo: Voice-Driven Web Application</figcaption>
</div>
<h3 id="implement-the-web-application">Implement the Web Application</h3>
<p>The application will be based on HTML, CSS, and TypeScript as the programming language. We’ll use the latest Angular version through Angular Material components.
Also, We will define a <em>reactive programming</em> approach using <em>Observables</em> and the <em>AsyncPipe</em> from Angular. Finally, we will provide a <em>Strategy pattern</em>  implementation among other features.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-project">Creating the project</h4>
<p>Let’s create the web application from scratch using the latest <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ng new web-speech-angular --routing --style css --prefix wsa --strict
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>--routing</code>: Generates a <em>routing</em> module for the project.</li>
<li><code>--style</code>: The file extension for style files.</li>
<li><code>--prefix</code>: Set a prefix for the component selectors</li>
<li><code>--strict</code>: Available from <a href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41">Angular 10</a>. Enable a stricter type checking and build optimization options.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="adding-angular-material">Adding Angular Material</h4>
<p>Adding Angular Material would be simple at this point:</p>
<p>Now, we can follow the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#overall-structural-guidelines">Overall structural guidelines</a> from Angular to generate <code>shared</code> and <code>material</code> modules:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ng generate module shared --module app
ng generate module shared/material --module shared
</code></pre></div><p>These commands will generate the following structure in your project:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">|- src/
    |- app/
        |- shared/
            |- material/
                |- material.module.ts
            |- shared.module.ts
</code></pre></div><h4 id="adding-the-web-speech-module">Adding the <code>web-speech</code> module</h4>
<p>It’s time to add a new module to define the components needed to display the controls of the app.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ng generate module web-speech --module app
ng generate component web-speech
</code></pre></div><p>Now we will have the following structure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">|- src/
    |- app/
        |- shared/
        |- web-speech/
            |- web-speech.module.ts
            |- web-speech.component.ts|html|css
</code></pre></div><h4 id="adding-the-web-apis-directory">Adding the <code>web-apis</code> directory</h4>
<p>Let’s create a new folder to group services related to the Web APIs we are going to use. Also, let’s define some TypeScript files for the languages, Notifications, Errors and Events to be supported by the new service.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ng generate service shared/services/web-apis/speech-recognizer
</code></pre></div><p>After run the previous command and create the model files, the structure will be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">|- src/
    |- app/
        |- shared/
            |- shared.module.ts
            |- services/
                |- web-apis/
                    |- speech-recognizer.service.ts
            |- model/
                |- languages.ts
                |- speech-error.ts
                |- speech-event.ts
                |- speech-notification.ts
        |- web-speech/
            |- web-speech.module.ts
            |- web-speech.component.ts|html|css
</code></pre></div><h4 id="modeling-notifications-events-and-errors">Modeling Notifications, Events and Errors</h4>
<p>Since the current specification is written in JavaScript, we can provide some TypeScript code to take advantage of the <em>typing</em>. This is even more important since the project has been configured with the <code>strict</code> mode enabled for TypeScript.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>// languages.ts
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>languages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'en-US'</span><span>,</span> <span>'es-ES'</span><span>];</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>defaultLanguage</span> <span>=</span> <span>languages</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>

<span>// speech-error.ts
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SpeechError</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>NotAllowed</span> <span>=</span> <span>'not-allowed'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>Unknown</span> <span>=</span> <span>'unknown'</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// speech-event.ts
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SpeechEvent</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Start</span><span>,</span>
  <span>End</span><span>,</span>
  <span>FinalContent</span><span>,</span>
  <span>InterimContent</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// speech-notification.ts
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>interface</span> <span>SpeechNotification</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>event?</span>: <span>SpeechEvent</span><span>;</span>
    <span>error?</span>: <span>SpeechError</span><span>;</span>
    <span>content?</span>: <span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Pay attention to <code>SpeechError</code> enum. The string keys match with actual values from the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/#speechreco-error">SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent</a> specification.</p>
<h4 id="creating-the-speechrecognizerservice-asynchronous-speech-recognition">Creating the <code>SpeechRecognizerService</code> (Asynchronous Speech Recognition)</h4>
<p>The main goal would be to define an abstraction of the functionality we’ll need for the application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a basic configuration for the <code>SpeechRecognizerService</code>(a <code>webkitSpeechRecognition</code> instance which is supported by Google Chrome).</li>
<li>Define a language configuration.</li>
<li><em>Catch</em> interim and final results.</li>
<li>Allow start and stop the recognizer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code provides an implementation for those requirements:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>// speech-recognizer.service.ts
</span><span></span><span>@Injectable</span><span>({</span>
  <span>providedIn</span><span>:</span> <span>'root'</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>SpeechRecognizerService</span> <span>{</span>

    <section>
      <p><i>For the Q2 2020 Yelp Economic Average report, we’re using a new methodology that tracks several indicators on a daily basis, and extends into Q3. For more on the methodology for this report, <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q2-2020.html#methodology">click here</a>.</i></p>
    
      
        <p>As cities reopen and COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country, local governments have taken action, pivoting their reopening plans. Many businesses that eagerly reopened doors in June were forced to scale back operations and in some cases even shut down again — a costly action for many small businesses.</p>
        <p>Yelp’s latest <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">Local Economic Impact Report</a>, published in June, showed a decrease of business closures compared to April and an increase in consumers getting back to their normal activities – such as dining in at restaurants, heading back into shopping malls and planning weddings. We’re now beginning to uncover longer term trends including a correlation between interest in restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms to a spike in COVID-19 cases across hotspot states. The report also measures business closure data that reflects an unstable economy; slower, but still consistent changes in consumers getting back to pre-pandemic activities; and sustained interest in supporting Black-owned businesses.</p>

      <h2>Increased Consumer Activity in May Correlates with Increased COVID-19 Cases in June</h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html" target="_blank">mid-to-late March</a> we saw consumer activity drop swiftly and uniformly across the nation. This new status quo was maintained in most states through at least mid-to-late April. In May, some states maintained the shutdown level of consumer interest, but many started to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm.</p>

          <p>As people began resuming common pre-pandemic activities across states like Florida, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Georgia and others – specifically, frequenting restaurants, bars and nightlife, and gyms – a clear spike in COVID-19 cases within those locations quickly followed.</p>

        <p>As outbreaks worsened through late June, consumer interest in these categories started to come back down in states like Florida, Texas, South Carolina, and Arizona. This emphasizes the strong correlation between the pandemic and consumer behavior. When there's a major outbreak, Yelp data suggests it negatively impacts consumer interest in businesses where social distancing may be harder to enforce. If COVID-19 cases remain flat or decrease in a state, consumer behavior and local policies tend to revert towards the pre-pandemic norm, leaving the state vulnerable to a major outbreak in the near future. These outbreaks may then require stricter measures to suppress cases, as we are currently seeing in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/states-reopening-coronavirus-map/" target="_blank">California and Florida</a>.</p>

      <h2>Business Closures Fluctuate Across the Nation</h2>
        <p>The curve in business closures that we once saw <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yelp-coronavirus-economic-impact-report.html" target="_blank">going down</a> has continued to change over the last month. We last reported 140,000 total businesses closures on Yelp from March 1 to June 15. We saw this increase to more than 147,000 total business closures on June 29 and then drop again to just more than 132,500 total business closures as of July 10. This rapidly changing number of closures reflects rapidly evolving situations at the local level, as some states with rising cases start to close again, while others continue to reopen. In April, we reported more than 175,000 business closures indicating that only 24% of businesses that were closed in April have reopened.</p>

      <!--<h2>Hed</h2>-->
        <p>Even as total closures fall, permanent closures increase with 72,842 businesses permanently closed, out of the 132,580 total closed businesses, an increase of 15,742 permanent closures since June 15. This also means that the percentage of permanent to temporary business closures is rising, with permanent closures now accounting for 55% of all closed businesses since March 1, an increase of 14% from June when we reported 41% of closures as permanent. Overall, permanent closures have steadily increased since the peak of the pandemic with minor spikes in March, followed by May and June.</p>

        <p>Most states have seen a plateau of temporary closures, while Arizona, Texas, and Florida have started to see a recent increase again due to spikes in COVID-19 cases. California, Texas, and New York have the highest total number of closures (29,351, 11,118 and 8,731, total closed businesses, respectively).</p>
        <p>On a metro level, Las Vegas, NV, is suffering from the highest rate of permanently closed businesses with 861 businesses permanently closed, as the city reacts to a <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2020/jun/30/closed-casinos-yielded-near-zero-nevada-tax-revenu/" target="_blank">decrease in tourism</a>. Meanwhile, Los Angeles, CA, has the most closures with 11,342 total temporary and permanent business closures.</p>

      <h2>Permanent Closures Continue to Increase Across Restaurants, Retail and Other Industries</h2>
        <p>While some industries have been able to slowly bounce back with fewer temporary closures, many are still enduring an increasing number of permanently closed businesses.</p>
        <p>The restaurant industry now reflects the highest total business closures, recently surpassing retail. As of July 10, there have been 26,160 total restaurant closures, an increase of 2,179 since June 15. Of the all closed restaurants in July, 15,770 have permanently closed (60%), accounting for 2,956 more permanent closures, a 23% increase since June 15. Meanwhile, bars and nightlife, an industry 6X smaller than restaurants, have endured an especially high closure rate, with 5,454 total business closures, 2,429 (44%) of which are permanent closures.</p>
        <p>Many retail businesses shifted their operating models and started offering curbside pickup and online ordering, unfortunately those measures aren’t always enough to sustain their business long term. Shopping and retail businesses have endured 26,119 total business closures, of which 12,454 are permanent, representing 48% of closed retail businesses on Yelp. On June 15, we reported 27,663 closed retail and shopping businesses, of which only 9,640 were permanently closed. Since then we’ve seen 1,544 retail businesses reopen, however an even higher number have been forced to shut their doors permanently, accounting for 2,814 new permanent closures, a 29% increase in permanent retail closures in the last month.</p>
        <p>The beauty industry follows a similar trend as the retail industry with 13,609 total business closures, a decrease from 15,348 in June, as many businesses have been able to reopen their brick and mortar locations. However, the industry has suffered from 1,213 new permanent closures since June 15, totalling 4,897 permanent closures as of July 10.</p>
        <p>Similar to retail and beauty, though there are fewer temporarily closed businesses, the fitness industry has also suffered from an increase in permanent closures. As of July 10, there have been 4,907 total fitness closures, a decrease of 682 closed businesses since June 15. However, of all closed fitness businesses 1,930 are permanently closed, representing 39% of closed fitness businesses on Yelp – 504 more permanent closures than in June. While some fitness businesses have been able to continue operating through virtual classes, many smaller brick and mortar studios have been forced to shut their doors permanently, as these small businesses battle affording high rent and operating expenses without being able to use their physical space.</p>

<p>This essay will hopefully be the first post in a series covering some of the basics of how things in the past, particularly in the ancient world, were made.  This isn’t a how-to guide (we’re not going to go into that much depth) but instead intended as a window into the many tasks that made a pre-modern society <em>work</em>, tasks that are so often <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">left </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/">out </a>of the modern imagination of the past.  Throughout, I want to highlight not only the jobs, but also <strong>the people who did them</strong> and the <strong>human landscapes they created</strong>.</p>



<p>Each entry in this series is likely to come in multiple parts – as you will soon see, almost everything worth making has to be made in quite a few steps and each step is often complex enough to occupy its own weekly post.  I <em>think</em> this series will run in four parts (possibly with a fifth part addendum), but no plan survives contact with my tendency to overwrite.  I wanted to start with farming instead of something more flashy and exciting like iron production (where I know there is quite a lot of interest in how one goes from reddish rock to polished sword), for the simple reason that <strong>agriculture sits at the foundation of every other form of production</strong>.  Every person in an agrarian society whose job – mining, smithing, tanning, timber-cutting, trading, tailoring, <em>everything</em> – doesn’t involve primary food production is subsisting off of the food production of others, typically (as we’ll see) <em>many</em> others.</p>



<p>That said, <em>this post</em> is mostly about <strong>farmers</strong> more than <em>farming</em> (we will talk about the mechanics of farming, just not right away!).  One thing I want to highlight in this series are the many different jobs and occupations <em>and the people who did them</em> who tend to lurk in the background of our imagination of the past, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">where they appear at all</a>.  And in the case of farming in much of the pre-modern world, the survival strategies of subsistence farmers exert a very strong shaping influence on the countryside and life for non-farmers (terminology note: ‘subsistence’ farming refers to farming directed primarily towards the survival of the farmers and their families; in much of the pre-modern world, there was a fairly sharp divide between <em>most</em> farmers who farmed on a subsistence basis and the largest market-oriented estates of the wealthy, who will be our focus <em>next</em> week).</p>



<p>As a final caveat before we dive in, I specialize in the economy of the ancient Mediterranean, so my observations here are going to tend (where not otherwise noted) to be <em>most</em> true in the Mediterranean world, in that period (c. 650 BC – 450 AD).  Where I know there are major exceptions, I’ll try to note them, but it’s simply not possible to know every production permutation <em>everywhere</em> and at <em>every</em> time.  For this series, we’re going to focus on wheat production, with a bit of a Mediterranean bias (but I’ve tried to pull in some evidence from North China as well; by and large I’ve found that wheat cultivation seems to create <em>similar </em>patterns everywhere, but there is local variation).</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p><strong>Bibliography note at the outset</strong>: for the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have an easy footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but I’ll include a bibliography note up front for the whole series.  My information for the ancient Mediterranean is drawn from a number of sources, the most important of which are P. Erdkamp, <em>The Grain Market in the Roman Empire</em> (2005); N. Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War: Farms, Families and Death in the Middle Republic</em> (2004); Foxhall and Forbes, “Σιτομετρεία: The Role of Grain as a Staple Food in Classical Antiquity,” <em>Chiron</em> 12 (1982) and Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 80 (1990), and just reading a pile of Greek and Roman agricultural writers (Columella, Cato, Pliny the Elder, Xenophon, etc).<br>Note also C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014), W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile</em> (2001) and R. Bagnall and B. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(1994) for the Egyptian demographic modeling.  Egypt is an important reference for demographic data because relatively more records survive there due to the arid conditions preserving papyrus.<br>I am less well read on Medieval European agriculture, but I should note some reliance here on M. Bloch, <em><em>La Société Féodale</em></em> (1940; available trans. Manyon, 1962) and E.L.R. Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966; available trans. J. Day, 1976).  Also relevant on general features and broad continuity, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge</em> (2003); for the military history minded, Landers (and Rosenstein) are more focused on the connection between agriculture and military activity.<br>My references to Chinese agriculture are from Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980).</p>



<h2>Why Bread?</h2>



<p>From the outset I want to note that agriculture, especially subsistence agriculture, typically is not planting simple mono-cultures of a single crop.  I opted to focus in this series on <strong>bread</strong> because it is <em><strong>usefully simple</strong></em> for a number of reasons.  It lets us focus on wheat and barley, which are relatively simple crops to talk about but also (in the broad sweep of Eurasia where they were the primary crop) provided the majority of calories for the <em><strong>vast</strong></em> majority of people.  Vegetables, fruit, meat, other animal products (along with sauces and things derived from them) were in the ancient Mediterranean generally expensive things, used by most normal people (read: the not-super-rich) to <em>flavor</em> a meal that still consisted mostly of bread, when they were available at all.  That’s because (as we’ll see) wheat and barley were efficient and cheap to grow at scale.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that people <em>only</em> ate bread, to be clear.  The Mediterranean diet is built on a <em>triad</em> of grapes, grains and olives; animal products were also in the diet.  Grains don’t have a broad enough range of nutrients to really subsist someone forever; you need proteins and vitamins and so on.  <strong><em>But</em></strong> when we are looking at the bulk of what was eaten any way we measure it – calories, volume, weight, labor intensity, economic scale – cheap, mass-available grains just dominate, so that’s where we start.  When scholars model ancient agriculture and food habits, they build a nutritional model centered on grains and then supplement with other things as necessary (which as an aside is <em>also</em> how the Greeks and Romans actually talk about food – rations that we are quite sure included meat and vegetables are typically given as grain allowances, e.g. Thuc 4.16.1; Plut. <em>Lyc</em>. 12.2; Plb. 6.39.13; Cato, <em>de Agr.</em> 56).</p>



<p>Finally, a <strong>terminology note</strong>: when I say <strong>wheat</strong> I mean genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"><em>triticum</em> </a>and its subspecies; when I say <strong>barley</strong> I mean <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">Hordeum vulgare</a></em>.  I am going to use ‘grain’ or ‘grains’ to refer to both crops together (although there are many other grains).  The British frequently use the word ‘corn’ to refer to wheat; this causes no end of confusion in Americans, for whom ‘corn’ means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a>.  I do not know that I will reference maize, but if I do, I will call it maize and to avoid confusion, I am not going to use corn at all as a term.  Apologies to my British readers whose usage is, I should note, older but also more confusing.</p>



<p>To start with, we need to start not with our crops, <strong>but with our farm and farmers.</strong></p>



<h2>The Farming Household</h2>



<p>Looking at our peasant household, what we generally have are large families on small farms.  The households in these farms were not generally nuclear households, but extended ones.  Pre-Han Chinese documents assume a household to include three generations: two elderly parents, their son, his wife, and their four children (eight individuals total).  Ptolemaic and Roman census data reveal a bewildering array of composite families, including multi-generational homes, but also households composed of multiple nuclear families of siblings (so a man, his wife, his brother and then brother’s wife and their children, for instance), and so on.<strong>  Normal family units tended to be around eight individuals, but with wide variation</strong> (for comparison, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html">the average household size in the United States for a family is 3.14</a>).</p>

Note how many individuals (presumably a mix of neighbors, friends and the extended family) are attached to this dwelling – and also how it is a multi-purpose structure, both a workshop and residence.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At the same time that households <strong>were <em>large</em> (by modern standards), the farms they tilled were, by modern standards, very small</strong>.  The normal size of a Roman household small farm is generally estimated between 5 and 8 <em>iugera</em> (a Roman measurement of land, roughly 3 to 5 acres); in pre-Han Northern China (where wheat and millet, not rice, were the staple crops), the figure was “one hundred mu (4.764 acres)” – essentially the same.  In Languedoc, a study of Saint-Thibery in 1460 showed 118 households (out of 189) on farms of less than 20 <em>setérée</em> (12 acres or so; the <em>setérée </em>appears to be an inexact unit of measurement); 96 of them were on less than 10 <em>setérée</em> (about 6 acres).  So while there is a <em>lot</em> of variation, <strong>by and large it seems like the largest cluster of household farms tend to be around 3 to 8 acres or so; 5 acre farms are a good ‘average’ small farm.</strong></p>



<p>This coincidence of normal farm size and family size is not an accident, but essentially represents …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Resilience in Action is a podcast about all things resilience, from SRE to software engineering, to how it affects our personal lives, and more. Resilience in Action is hosted by Blameless Staff SRE Amy Tobey. Amy has been an SRE and DevOps practitioner since before those names existed. She cares <em>deeply</em> about her community of SREs and wants to take what she’s learned over the 20+ years of her career to help others.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In our fourth episode, Amy chats with Craig Sebenik, SRE at Aurora and co-author of “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-sre/9781492054429/#:~:text=Book%20Description,sites%20continuously%20introduce%20new%20features.">What is SRE</a>?” and “<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/salt-essentials/9781491914427/">Salt Essentials</a>.” He has a degree from Le Cordon Bleu (Sydney, Australia), a Master's in Italian Cuisine (Apcius in Florene, Italy), and a Master's in Gastronomy (University of Rheims, France). His greatest passion is teaching what he has learned from adventures in SRE and cooking.<br></p><p>See the full transcript of their conversation below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: In lieu of introductions, I thought we should just jump straight into our first experiences on the internet.</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>My first introduction to the web specifically (not the internet) was in graduate school at Brown in 1991. I had been using Gopher for a number of years and I loved Gopher. It was fantastic, but obviously pictures were kind of a pain in Gopher. Maps and things like that were not generally accessible but textual information was really easy to find because of its hierarchical nature.</p><p>One of the graduate students I was working with pointed me at this "brand new" thing called the world wide web. It was Mosaic back in the early days, and this was on an educational network.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>What kind of machine was it?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was doing computational chemistry so they were all SGIs, even in those days with 19-20” monitors.</p><p>It was fantastic. I was used to Gopher and its hierarchical nature. Moving to the web was very, very different. And I said, "You know what? I'm looking for an email address for a friend of mine that I met at an internship a couple years before." The graduate student said, "Okay, what's the URL?" I'm like, "The what?". She said, "I need to know where to start."&nbsp;</p><p>In Gopher, you start at the root, you go to education or, in this case, New York and then you go down the chain looking for the right school. At this point, there were no search engines, and you had to know where to start. Looking back at the time, I&nbsp; was hopeful, but I had to say, "This thing sucks." I was not a fan of the web in the early days.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>Those of us that didn't really experience Gopher never knew that past. I came in late for Gopher. I hit Usenet early and then I basically skipped over Gopher entirely. Almost everybody I've talked to who experienced their formative time on Gopher tends to go, "Yeah this web stuff just kind of sucks by comparison."<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>Then WebCrawler and AltaVista came out. I'm like, "Oh, yeah. This makes it better." And then the big one hit—not the big one that most people today would think of—and that was Yahoo.</p><p>These college kids published essentially all their bookmarks (and this was back when Yahoo was something like cs.standford.edu/yahoo or something like that.) It was like, "This is fantastic." Much like Gopher, it was organized hierarchically.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>You were in school at this time for computational chemistry, so how the heck did you get from there to index technology?<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>I was always programming. I was programming on SGIs and then I transferred to University of Michigan and I graduated/dropped out. Whatever. It's all nuance. But I got my Masters from Michigan and I was, "Now I need a job. What do I know how to do?" At that point I didn't know a lot except how to program. The first job I got was actually a backup person. I would go in on Sundays and change the tapes.</p><p>That was a part time gig for three to four months. Then in ‘94, I found a mom-and-pop ISP located in Plymouth, Michigan. It's next to me down from Ann Arbor. There were maybe 20 employees and we were doing web design/ISP. We had a bank of modems that people would dial into.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>I kind of miss that entry point. That's a very different environment to cut your teeth in, compared to what a lot of corporations are like today. The friends of mine that did it described a shop where you could just basically—if you were getting stuff done—do whatever the heck you wanted. <strong>Can you talk a little bit about that environment and kind of how it molded how you approach reliability?</strong><br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>One of the big differences in those days was security. Security was not as big of a deal as it is today. You just did the little bit of security that you needed to, and because there were fewer tools, it was more on individuals to write their own little bash scripts. This would have been before things like ADUser were as common as they are today.</p><p>So you had to write your own ADUser script that would update the password file, create the home directory, and change permissions on the home directory from a skeleton. It's so funny seeing what exists today. I wrote something exactly like that. Granted it was nowhere near as resilient as they are today. The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person. They’d say, "We just signed this account. You need to add these 20 accounts to the main servers." You created a bash script with the current list of 20. You copied that script to all four servers, and you ran the script. You watched it and it was fine. The idea of centralized logging didn't exist, and the idea of metrics didn't exist in the same way.<br></p><blockquote>The number of edge cases that a general purpose tool has to deal with is significantly more than your specific scenario where you get a list of names from the sales person.</blockquote><p><strong>Amy Tobey:</strong> I mean we didn't even SSH really. There was SAR and rlogin.<br></p><p><strong>Craig Sebenik: </strong>We did do a little bit of SSH at the time but mostly it was Telnet.<br></p><p><strong>Amy Tobey: </strong>So we're at the late end of the 90s. That's where I started my career. I was a music major. I wasn't making enough progress on my university parts because as a music major usually you get sucked into all of the ensembles, which are usually a credit or two but they usually want four to six hours a week of your time. I was way behind. And then toward the end I thought, "Oh crap. I've got to start making money at some point." ThenI had some realizations about myself and whether I was really suited to teach in high school or middle school. I did half a semester of CS.</p><p>I had learned a bunch of Linux over the summer, so I thought, "Oh, I'll try this CS thing. This is exciting," and was eternally bored. I found a job in Detroit doing systems administration for a stock broker. That was my entry point. But at the time I was still presenting as a white male. I feel like that was a big part of how I got that opportunity. <strong>When I look back at it, I keep trying to find those details in the story that I can share with other people for how they can get their start in the industry because systems administration in our experience has been a great place to enter.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my self study of Rust, I’ve run into concepts that are different than anything else I’ve seen in other languages, and have had a hard time wrapping my head around. The purpose and usage of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code> is one of those concepts. I said to myself, “why not write a blog, it’ll help you, and maybe help someone else!”. Putting my thoughts and inquiries in writing has been helpful for me, and I hope it’s just as helpful for you!</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>To understand what these things are, we need to understand <em>Interior Mutability</em> and how it relates to “normal” Rust.</p>

<p>What’s interior mutability? Interior mutability is different than the <em>Inherited Mutability</em> that we are so used to (even if we didn’t know the technical term). Variables in Rust exhibit inherited mutability when they are defined using the <code>mut</code> keyword; this is the standard way of declaring a mutable variable. The following code is what you don’t want, producing the error below it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Error!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  |
2 |     let x = 1;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: make this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     x += 1;
  |     ^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change <code>let x = 1</code> to <code>let mut x = 1</code>, and we solve the problem! The program correctly prints</p>



<p>Ok cool, that’s easy. Now what do we do when we want to update a variable in a function, but don’t want to pass ownership? We just use a mutable reference!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in add_and_print is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// mutable reference to x is dropped</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span> <span>// Modify x in function</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x again</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x in main is {}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which prints</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x in add_and_print is 2.
The value of x in main is 3.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is expected. Cool, we can update mutable references in functions and still update them where owned. In the example above, the reference <code>&amp;mut x</code> has inherited mutability as <code>mut</code> is being passed down directly from the current scope (as we’ll see, in contrast to interior mutability).</p>

<p>Ok, now here’s a contrived example, but represents the use case of <code>Cell</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. Let’s say we have this struct.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, so it’s a struct that holds a mutable reference to an i32, so ownership of <code>x</code> doesn’t change, and the following compiles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and we get…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct is XStruct { x: 1 }.
The value of x is 1.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice, still compiles and prints the expected result! Now let’s try an mutate <code>x</code> in <code>main</code>!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>mut</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Declare a mutable variable x</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass a mutable reference to x</span>

    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify x...</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the compiler says…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   |
8  |     let x_struct = XStruct { x: &amp;mut x };
   |                                 ------ borrow of `x` occurs here
9  |
10 |     x += 1;
   |     ^^^^^^ use of borrowed `x`
11 |
12 |     println!("The value of x_struct is {:?}.", x_struct);
   |                                                -------- borrow later used here
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ughhhhhhh, we can’t do this. We’ve made a mutable borrow when defining <code>x_struct</code>, and it hasn’t gone out of scope yet. The compiler WILL NOT let us do this. To understand why we can’t do this, let’s review Rust’s borrow rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can have one mutable reference.
OR (exclusive)</li>
  <li>You can have multiple immutable references.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, our issue in the above example is that we have two references to <code>x</code>, and we want those references to be mutable. (Yeah I know, <code>x</code> in <code>main</code> isn’t borrowed, <code>x</code> owns it’s value, but I’d still think it be able to mutate it’s own data).</p>

<p>You may be asking, why do we have these rules in the first place? The reason is to prevent data races, which can result in nondeterministic errors, which are just awful to deal with (I won’t go deeper into data races as it’s a whole other topic in computer science and programming).</p>

<p>Ok, we have these rules, BUT I WANT MULTIPLE MUTABLE REFERENCES. That’s where interior mutability comes to the rescue!</p>

<p>The gist of interior mutability is that we can wrap something that’s <em>mutable</em> in a structure that is <em>immutable</em>. We can then create multiple immutable references to that thing (which follows rule #2 above), get a mutable reference when we’re ready, and then mutate the value! (We’ll discuss the caveats later. No free lunch, right?)</p>

<h3 id="refcellt-yay"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, YAY!</h3>

<p>So, think of <code>RefCell</code> as the tortilla of the interior mutability burrito… (ok I’ll stop). Here’s an example of our failed borrow example using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>RefCell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Mutably borrow and dereference the underlying data</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span> <span>// ref_cell_x is immutable</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ref_cell_x</span> <span>};</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span> <span>// Pass an immutable reference to x_struct</span>

    <span>*</span><span>ref_cell_x</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>()</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Modify ref_cell_x</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>ref_cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IT COMPILES!!!! The output we get is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: RefCell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is RefCell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…which is exactly what we expected! The value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> first starts as 1, we call <code>add_and_print</code> which increases the value inside to 2, then we add 1 again to the value in <code>ref_cell_x</code> and get a final value of 3, and both <code>ref_cell_x</code> and <code>x_struct</code> both have the same value. We did this all without creating a mutable reference to <code>ref_cell_x</code>!</p>

<h3 id="but-what-about-cellt">But what about <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p><code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> is just a different way to accomplish interior mutability. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you get a reference to the underlying data (note the <code>Ref</code> part). With <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you indirectly interact with the wrapped value by using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> (and some other fancy methods). Here’s the same example from above rewritten using <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::</span><span>Cell</span><span>;</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>XStruct</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'a</span> <span>Cell</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>x_struct</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>XStruct</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>x_struct</span><span>.x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"The value of x_struct in add_and_print is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell_x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x_struct</span> <span>=</span> <span>XStruct</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>cell_x</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>add_and_print</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>.get</span><span>();</span>
    <span>cell_x</span><span>.set</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x_struct is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>x_struct</span><span>);</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Final value of x is {:?}."</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the output is…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>The value of x_struct in add_and_print is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 2 } }.
Final value of x_struct is XStruct { x: Cell { value: 3 } }.
Final value of x is Cell { value: 3 }.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See? Same result. As you can tell, the only difference is that we first had to <code>get</code> the value out of the cell, modify it, and then <code>set</code> it again.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-use-refcellt-vs-cellt">When should I use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> vs. <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code>?</h3>

<p>There are two main differences between <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Cell</code>. First, types wrapped in <code>Cell</code> must implement the <code>Copy</code> trait while those in <code>RefCell</code> don’t need to. This makes sense. When calling <code>get</code> on a <code>Cell</code>, you are getting a copy of the wrapped data, whereas the methods associated with <code>RefCell</code> are <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code>, which return references to the underlying data. Copying data back and forth does come at a performance cost, especially if the wrapped data is big, therefore making <code>RefCell</code> an attractive candidate.</p>

<p>The second difference is that <code>RefCell</code>’s references are checked at runtime, which comes at a performance cost of verifying reference counts and possibly being completely wrong about your borrowing logic and causing your program to panic (not good); you can’t cause panics using <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> with <code>Cell</code> as you’re not modifying the data through reference. Here’s an example of what can go wrong with <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cell</span><span>::{</span><span>RefCell</span><span>};</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>cell</span> <span>=</span> <span>RefCell</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the underlying data</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_1</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>cell</span><span>.borrow_mut</span><span>();</span> <span>// Mutably borrow the data again (cell_ref_1 is still in scope though...)</span>
    <span>*</span><span>cell_ref_2</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"RefCell value: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>cell_ref_2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program compiles, but panics halfway through running.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What? Isn’t the compiler supposed to prevent these types of reference errors? Yes, for “normal” mutable references. The reference rules stated earlier still apply, they’re just enforced at runtime when using <code>RefCell</code>.</p>

<p>And this is the double edged sword of <code>RefCell</code>s. There are times where we need more flexibility than just a singular mutable reference. <code>RefCell</code> gives us this flexibility, but at the cost of not checking our references statically.</p>

<p>I hope this explanation of interior mutability, <code>Cell</code>, and <code>RefCell</code> was helpful to you! Feel free to contact me if you any comments, suggestions, or just need to correct me!</p>

There is no word for something in between: an advisor who spends 5-10 hours per week on the company, owns 10-25% of the company and doesn't only advise but also gets shit done when needed. So far the best term I could come up with is a 'hands-on advisor'.</p><p id="viewer-7femf">A few months ago I become a hands-on advisor for the company called <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=networking_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrowthClub</a>. GrowthClub is a community of founders with $5K+ MRR where founders exchange growth hacks and build genuine connections in 1-on-1 video calls.</p><p id="viewer-dbesc">The founder of the company, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxim-zavadskiy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maxim Zavadskiy</a>, was a solo founder. Fun fact: I was a user of his service myself. I saw potential in what he was building and offered him some advice and help along the road. When shit got real, we agreed that I could be helping him on a continuous basis.</p><p id="viewer-m23r">So far it seemed to work miracles. Try it out. Maxim themselves says "<em>I'm quite certain that in these 5-10 hours a week Dima moves project forward more than would 90% of other possible co-founders working full-time for GrowthClub. The most critical help that I get is co-piloting: a second, much fresher head for the decisions we take. Plus he also gets real work done, like writing this article or partnerships. It would have been impossible to score Dima otherwise, as he is already committed full-time to his company".</em></p><blockquote id="viewer-42od2"><p><em>I'm quite certain that in these 5-10 hours a week Dima moves project forward more than would 90% of other possible co-founders working full-time</em></p></blockquote><p id="viewer-46s9j">One of the benefits is that you can score someone with a lot more experience than you have. Stellar people already have their own projects and they might not be able to join you full-time, but finding 5-10 hours per week tends to be possible if your venture is inspiring enough.</p><h2 id="viewer-d968p">GrowthClub</h2><div id="viewer-7qsk8"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.growthclub.online/post/advice-for-solo-founders" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/49c34c_fae67c1290a6457c9b531b07790c4753~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1514,h_1066,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/49c34c_fae67c1290a6457c9b531b07790c4753~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-cjb5c">Another option that many people don't consider is joining <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrowthClub</a> itself as a member. Around 50% of our members are solo founders. Why?</p><p id="viewer-fs24t">A big part of our community is founders being helpful to each other. A part of that is bouncing off ideas and growth hacks, brainstorming. Another part is a bit unexpected and is our secret sauce: we consciously nudge people to help each other, form meaningful relationships, and to make commitments to others through structured meetings and exercises. That way you actually have chances on engaging in projects with other solo-founders and eventually become co-founders. Let me explain this more.</p><p id="viewer-8di9n">There are a lot of networking sites for founders. Yet they provide no structure for those networking meetings. As a result, genuine connections are rarely formed.</p><p id="viewer-4gd1i">In GrowthClub, we are very selective with whom we take in. We always have an onboarding call, a trial meeting with every new member. Our platform allows members to keep track of time and to divide the meeting clearly: 50% of the time I help you, 50% of the time you help me. We use some coaching exercises to help people with clarifying their goals and committing to the next actions.</p><p id="viewer-9cig6">All of this, exchange of growth hacks, genuine connections, commitment is exactly what every solo founder is missing.</p><p id="viewer-3kgd9">Our vision with <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrowthClub</a> is to build a Silicon Valley in the cloud, and you might be now seeing what we are getting at here.</p><h2 id="viewer-agni6">In sum</h2><p id="viewer-9smuq">A co-founder is hard to find. An advisor isn't committed enough. Try to find a hands-on advisor or join a community like <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=solo_article_body&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrowthClub</a> that provides you with 4 co-founders per month.</p><p id="viewer-4qq1h">Thanks for sticking till the end! I am a hands-on advisor at <a href="https://www.growthclub.online/?utm_source=growthclub&amp;utm_medium=networking_article_footer&amp;utm_campaign=content_promo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrowthClub</a>. GrowthClub is a peer to peer coaching platform for high-quality founders. In GrowthClub you gain focus, improve execution, and manage stress through curated 1:1 video-calls with fellow founders.</p><p id="viewer-5aa4i">I started with GrowthClub as a user. I liked it so much that I ended up helping the founder. Currently, after experiencing a great inflow of founders from our launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/growthclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a> and <a href="https://newsletterest.com/message/25153/Community-the-new-business-model-for-indie-hackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indie Hackers</a> featured article, we are signing up 30 hand-picked founders to form the core of our platform to actively iterate the product with them.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
              <p>
                As a small startup, when it comes to process (the word itself induces unpleasant flashbacks to sitting in tons of unproductive meetings at big companies) we try to follow the “if it’s not broken, then don’t fix it” mindset. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For a long time, since it was just Eric and I working together, we got by with almost no documentation other than a heap of disorganized Dropbox Paper documents, tons of calls at odd hours (often lasting until 2am), and a bunch of texts and/or Slack messages.
              </p>
              <p>
                This stopped working when two things happened: 1) we began working with our first contractor and 2) we began onboarding a lot more new customers. Things got a lot busier and resources became more scarce (there are only so many hours in the day!), and because we were so disorganized it was hard to keep focused on our actual goals instead of just dealing with whatever fires came up. Soon it became evident that <i>our lack</i> of process was holding us back. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve this, we followed the 80/20 rule to figure out how we could implement a minimal amount of process to help us reap a majority of the benefits. After trying a few things that haven’t worked, these are the 4 tools we’ve landed on that help us plan and execute against our goals each week: 
              </p>
              <ol>
                  <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, for weekly priority tracking</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.cadencework.com/">Cadence</a>, for status and progress updates</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.linear.app/">Linear</a>, for task tracking</li>
                  <li>Only two scheduled 15 minute meetings to begin and end the week</li>
                </ol>
              
              
              <p>
                At Cadence, we run weekly sprints. We kick off each week with a short 15-minute meeting. This meeting is important because it is where we decide and align on what our top 3 weekly priorities are.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then record those weekly priorities in Notion and assign each priority an owner. For that week, the owner’s top goal is to achieve their priority, meaning they should prioritize and scope their tasks however they want so that they can do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our weekly priority table in Notion looks like:
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="https://www.cadencework.com/assets/img/notion-priorities.png" alt="Notion">
              </figure>
              <p>
                Afterwards, we break each of our priorities into discrete engineering tasks and add them to Linear. (I will probably make a future post detailing how we track tasks and manage cycles in Linear, but that’s out of scope for now.) 
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the week, we use Cadence to update each other on the progress of our tasks as we work on them. Not only does Cadence eliminate the need for daily status calls, it also helps us proactively identify blockers. With our Cadence updates, we can help each other debug problems either directly in a threaded discussion on Slack or a quick, synchronous call. 
              </p>
              <p>
                This is what our Cadence updates look like: 
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                We even use Cadence to praise members of our team, which further helps us stay connected throughout the week. 😄

              </figure>
              <p>
                Finally, at the end of the week, we hop back on a call to assess how we did on achieving our priorities for that week. We also catch up with each other and chat about any fun weekend plans we have coming up. 😄
              </p>

                Ultimately, as is true for any company, the product development cycle is a constantly evolving one. In fact, I am sure I will re-read this post in a few months and barely recognize what I am talking about. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<p>It won’t take long before customers start asking for one particular kind of feature: integrating into other tools that they use all the time. They have adopted your product into their routine and their workflow, only to notice that something is missing. Some steps need to be taken to get your product to seamlessly join into the range of other tools your customers use to solve their problems.</p>



<p>You are looking for product–workflow fit. While it’s great to be able to use your product as a standalone solution to their problem, your customers will value it much higher if it comes with two kinds of integrations: input integration and output integration. To provide a basic level of both, build your product to accept and return data in commonly used data formats (such as the eternally requested CSV format). If the workflow requires interactions with cloud services, you will find that most of them provide easily used and well-documented APIs.</p>



<p><strong>Input Integrations</strong></p>



<p>Find out the shape of your customers’ data at the outset of their problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say your audience is plumbers who need help requisitioning new inventory of their pipefitting supplies. Do they already have an inventory management system that has an API? Are they maybe using an Excel sheet or a Google spreadsheet? Do they have such a system at all, or do they “go and check” regularly?</p>



<p>Whatever it is, you will need to allow your customers to use the system they already have in place. Forcing them to adopt another system just because your product only works with that is a surefire way to build a tool that your prospective customers won’t even try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every kind of additional input format you support will open your product to more potential customers. This requires research and expert knowledge of the field you’re operating in. Of course, at some point, the fraction of customers will be tiny, a niche within the niche, and their potential revenue will be lower than what it costs you to build and maintain an integration. That, too, requires insight into your market.</p>



<p>Whenever you work with data imports, here are a few basic ideas:</p>



<p><strong>• Integrate the industry-standard format.</strong> Many industries have developed common interchange data formats over time, and they usually are specified in great detail. This is an easy choice if you want to support the biggest number of customers.</p>



<p><strong>• Integrate comma-separated values.</strong> This is the lingua franca of data. Almost every software tool eventually understands and produces comma-separated values, the CSV format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Integrate Excel files and Google sheets.</strong> Often, that’s the highest stage that your prospects will reach with their self-invented and self-organized systems. These are the systems you intend to replace, so make it easy to migrate the existing data into your product.</p>



<p><strong>• Integrate JSON and/or XML.</strong> When there are already existing services and APIs in your space, make your product compatible with their outputs. Remember, your product exists in a landscape of other services, and fitting into your customers’ workflow is the way to adoption.</p>



<p><strong>Output Integration</strong></p>



<p>What is true for your customers’ workflow before they use your product is also true for when you’ve solved their critical problem successfully: they need to continue with other steps. Allowing their data to be easily utilized right after using your service will significantly increase your customer retention and turn your product from a nice-to-have into a must-have.</p>



<p>When you look into which data formats your customers expect, look into both the immediate steps that follow and the final outcome of your customers’ task. If you can supply data in a shape that allows for both to be maximally valuable, you’re helping twice. If you can enrich your customers’ data with something they can use later down the road, your product delivers value even when they’re done using it.</p>



<p>When you’re exploring what shape your result data should have, here are a few thoughts:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>• Produce the industry-standard format.</strong> As with the input data, this will give you access to the largest group of prospective customers. It will also make sure that other tools that eventually integrate with your solution implement this format, further normalizing the industry standard.</p>



<p><strong>• Allow for CSV data export.</strong> Your customers may not need it all the time, but this data format is surprisingly relevant for retention. It’s commonly used when your customers want to experiment with what using your data with another tool would be like. If you allow them to do this easily, it can further consolidate your product as an essential part of completing tasks.</p>



<p><strong>• Produce machine-readable data like JSON.</strong> A service that can be accessed by humans and machines is twice as valuable as one that can only be used by people. Allow your more technical customers to use your product in a programmatical way, and the impact of your solution will increase significantly. After all, the types of solutions that other businesses can create by integrating your service as one of many are thousand-fold and extraordinary!</p>



<p><strong>• Facilitate reporting.</strong> Whatever problem your service solves, it’s likely that someone has to report what they have been doing and how well they’ve done it. For that, make it easy for your customers to export their transactional data, like how often and how much they have used your service. This is also a selling point when you’re trying to convince managers and team leads to purchase your product. That way, the problem solves your customers’ critical problems as well as allowing their managers to measure their performance—a win-win-win situation.</p>



<p><strong>Integrating Beyond Data Formats</strong></p>



<p>Input and output integrations cover the basic data workflow that your customers have. For deeper integrations, you can build extensions that integrate other SaaS or standalone software products that make up parts of the daily operations of your customers.</p>



<p>Many SaaS products can be integrated programmatically, usually using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oa">OAuth</a> or <a href="https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api-key/">API-key</a>-based credentials. Either way, they can provide a number of interesting opportunities. The most basic integrations enable you to access some subset of your customers’ data stored on another SaaS service, either temporarily or until the access is revoked. More advanced integrations will make things like data synchronization, manipulation, and reporting a highly automatable and time-saving endeavor—all of which are highly valued as additional side-effects of a tool that solves your customers’ critical problem.</p>



<p>Think about how you can enable other businesses to integrate with your product as well. How would offering a programmatic interface enable other services to provide additional benefits to their customers? How could a service at another part of your customers’ workflow benefit from a direct integration? Could that remove superfluous steps like data conversion or export/import? If you can provide a means for developers to integrate your product into theirs, you amplify the reach into your audience by overlapping it with theirs.</p>



<p>On the user-experience side of your customers, consider supplying <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/169080/beginner-geek-everything-">browser extensions</a>. Often, a little button or link placed into another website can make all the difference. This was the first integration we built at FeedbackPanda. We added a little panda face, already our logo at the time, into the online classrooms by having our customers install a Chrome browser extension. Clicking that button would open a new tab, transmit a bit of information about the classroom to an endpoint on our site, and our frontend would automatically import that information into a form. This was very simple, but it saved our customers a few dozen clicks and a few seconds of typing every time they needed to create a new record. It wasn’t very hard to convince people that this was valuable: a 10-second video was all we needed.</p>



<p>Browser extensions are easy to create and deploy, as browser vendors have established browser extension stores that allow for automatic deployments and updates. Building an extension is straightforward, as there is a lot of good documentation available.</p>



<p>A word of warning about browser integrations into third-party websites and services. At FeedbackPanda, we integrated into a lot of online schools’ web portals. Those businesses changed their products a lot and without notifying anyone in advance. Since we never partnered with them, there was no way for us to ever learn about this before it happened. Any changes to the data that our extension needed to work would break it, and we would have to release a fixed version. Consequentially, we had to implement continuous automated tests and alarm systems that would tell us immediately when such a change happened so that we could react quickly. As the browser extension stores can take a few hours to distribute an updated version, being quick to deploy a fix is essential to have as few customers as possible impacted by such issues.</p>



<p>If the browser environment has certain limitations that prevent you from fully solving your customers’ problems (such as blocking notifications or native filesystem access), you can build and offer dedicated <a href="https://electronjs.org/">desktop</a> or <a href="https://quasar.dev/">mobile</a> applications. Only do this if it’s required to use your product efficiently. Building, maintaining, and deploying installable applications is a herculean effort compared to a SaaS product. All of a sudden, you have three different codebases and have to support different versions of different operating systems, all with their own update schedules and idiosyncrasies. If you can, restrict your product to a SaaS solution as long as you don’t have the resources to build a standalone application.</p>



<p>To make your product easier to integrate with other programs, provide a machine-accessible interface such as a <a href="https://blog.chartmogul.com/a">REST API</a> or any other way to automatically ingest data, using a commonly used and trusted authentication …</p></div></div>

                                        <p><span>On July 23, local time, the Supreme Court of British Columbia dis-closed evidence for the next stage of court hearings in Meng Wanzhou's extradition case. On May 27, the court ruled that the Meng Wanzhou case was, in essence, related to fraud.</span></p>
<p>The disclosed evidence suggests that Meng's case was masterminded by the U.S. and entirely political in nature. HSBC was involved throughout the scheme, taking actions such as maliciously framing Meng and fabri-cating evidence. This indicated that Meng is innocent.</p>
<p><strong>The crime was falsified and allegations were groundless</strong></p>
<p>According to the Record of Case that the U.S. submitted to the Canadian court, Meng concealed Huawei's relationship with Skycom Tech. Co., Ltd. ("Skycom"), which misled HSBC into continuing providing bank-ing services to Huawei. Therefore, HSBC violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and faced the risk of civil and criminal penalties. Meng's conduct amounted to fraud.</p>
<p>The only piece of key evidence in this case was a PowerPoint presenta-tion that Meng delivered to HSBC. The disclosed materials included the full text of the PowerPoint presentation and correspondence between HSBC and Huawei. However, it was found that the U.S. deliberately concealed and misinterpreted key information, meaning the allegations were inconsistent with facts.</p>
<p><strong>HSBC was aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom throughout the process</strong></p>
<p>HSBC professed that it was unclear about the relationship between Huawei and Skycom, but this was a blatant lie.</p>
<p>Skycom was Huawei's partner in Iran, and the relationship between these two companies was clear. Huawei had held shares in Skycom and Meng Wanzhou had once been on Skycom's Board of Directors for a short period of time. In 2007, Huawei sold its shares in Skycom and in April 2009, Meng left her position as a board member. Since then, the two companies had maintained normal business dealings.</p>
<p>HSBC was aware of Huawei's business in Iran throughout the process, and correspondence between the three parties in 2010 suggested HSBC had been fully aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. According to the 2009 and 2010 financial statements that Huawei sent to HSBC, the bank fully understood Skycom's business operations in Iran.</p>
<p>HSBC attempted to justify their false arguments and make their evi-dence sound more convincing by claiming that only "junior" employees were aware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. The bank went on to say that these "junior" employees did not report the relevant information to "senior" executives. Therefore, these executives could only assess the associated risks based on the PowerPoint presentation provided by Meng.</p>
<p>This rhetoric is simply nonsense.</p>
<p>As the world's largest telecom equipment manufacturer and a Fortune 500 company, Huawei had been the 17th largest customer of HSBC's Global Liquidity and Cash Management Department. In addition to this, the two companies had collaborated for nearly 20 years. Therefore, having a "junior" employee serving as Huawei's account manager would have been unreasonable as well as unbelievable. HSBC pointed its fingers at their own employees, which was neither a reason to exempt them from liability nor an act that complied with the regulations of the banking industry.</p>
<p>It is particularly worth noting that in December 2012, HSBC signed a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) due to the bank's own misconduct. This misconduct included vi-olations of U.S. sanctions against Iran. HSBC assured the U.S. DOJ that it would complete remediation in relation to all its group customers. How could it have been possible that HSBC was unaware of the relationship between Huawei and Skycom throughout this process? If HSBC was unaware, then this would imply that they deceived the U.S. DOJ and should be subject to heavy penalties.</p>
<p>The most basic compliance requirement for large financial institutions is "know your customers". HSBC had a dedicated risk management committee and claimed that all of its branches had established compli-ance departments. If their risk assessment relied solely on Meng's Pow-erPoint presentation, then why did they have so many compliance staff?</p>
<p>In order to frame Meng, HSBC defamed itself and seriously damaged a reputation that it had cultivated for over a century.</p>
                                                                                    <!--正文分页结束-->

Whenever I stopped to take photos from the Grand Canyon to Niagara Falls or any particularly impressive bit of architecture in between I took pains to frame the images just so.</p>

<p>I was determined to screen out the overhead electrical wires, trash dumpsters, and road construction that detracted from the postcard images I was trying to achieve. He said those pictures were clichés. Everyone already knows what they look like because they’re on a million kitchen calendars and Hallmark cards. Why not capture what the landscape really looks like? America is mostly parking lots, squat concrete strip malls, storm water retention ponds, refineries, chain link fences, and tract homes made of plastic siding. Photographing the authentic American landscape is both more challenging and ultimately more rewarding if you can do it well.</p>

<p>I was in Missoula, Montana a while back attempting to capture the look and feel of the place when the director of a senior center walked up to me and demanded to know what I was doing. I said I was a tourist taking pictures. She didn’t believe me. <em>These aren’t tourist scenes.</em> She insisted I stop or she was going to call the police. I offered a vague apology, showed her my identification, and said I’d stay put until the authorities arrived.</p>

<p>I was walking around a nondescript neighborhood in Chicago a few years ago when five squad cars surrounded me at an intersection. I was asked for my identification, they were keen to see what was on my camera, and there were all sorts of questions about who I was and what I was up to. The police wouldn’t say exactly why they descended on me in such an overwhelming fashion, but it was pretty clear there had been a report of unsavory activity of the terrorist variety.</p>

<p>Last year I was in Atlanta wandering around as I tend to do. So much of this particular neighborhood had devolved into a state of disrepair that the buildings were uninhabitable. But to my surprise people were still living in some of the units. More shocking still, as I later learned, landlords continued collecting rent from tenants.</p>
<p>As I explored the area and gathered photos a woman called out to me from across the street. <em>Not for camera view!</em> She kept repeating the phrase over and over. <em>Not for camera view!</em> I approached her, introduced myself, and asked her why she objected to my activities. She shook her head and waved her hands adamantly. <em>Not for camera view!</em> That’s all she ever said to me. I suspect a middle aged white guy with an expensive camera was an indication that there were forces at work that threatened her housing situation – as precarious and substandard as it was. I tried to imagine where she might be forced to live if these buildings and her situation were ever disturbed.</p>

<p>Some time later I was in Thousand Oaks, a prosperous suburban enclave in Southern California, doing the same thing. A man came out of his home and marched across his lawn toward me full of piss and vinegar. He demanded to know who I was, but before I could answer he let me know exactly who he thought I was. <em>I was a thief casing the neighborhood!</em>&nbsp;I’m a lot of things, but threatening isn’t one of them. I handed him my drivers license and told him the truth. Documenting the American landscape is a peculiar hobby of mine.</p>
<p>He scoffed, but decided I wasn’t a thief. <em>He realized at that moment that I was a real estate developer looking to destroy his community!</em>&nbsp;Nope. Not even close. I said I was curious about how people live in different places, et cetera. He became squinty eyed. <em>I was a news reporter looking to stir up trouble!</em> Well, I have a blog, but so does everyone and their dog. It’s not like I’m with the New York Times or anything. <em>Aha! You’re from the government!</em> (Read: a dirty communist.) And so it went.</p>

<p>I was in Detroit doing my usual thing when a man across the street began yelling at me. <em>You have no right to photograph me without express written permission!</em> He came at me with righteous indignation. I handed him my card, told him I was visiting from San Francisco, and said I was curious about what Detroit was really like. <em>I will sue you if you publish any photos of me in them! How dare you violate my rights!</em> I scrolled though the images on my camera screen and showed him I wasn’t actually photographing him at all. His expression flickered for a split second before he redirected his tirade. <em>You have no right to invade our community. You think this place is yours to do with as you please, but it’s not. </em>The conversation went on like this for a while. I wanted to know who he thought I was and what he thought I was doing. I wanted to know about the specifics of his grievances. <em>Anything I tell you will only be used against me and my people.</em></p>
<p>So this is what America is actually like. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Look out your window. Take a drive down to your local big box store. Walk around your neighborhood. This is reality. Just sayin’.</p>

  <p>Having a function implement an interface can be really useful when testing or programming Go code. Being able to do this allows you to have a data structure such as a map or an array hold both functions and structs that implement the interface. Let’s consider the following example, imagine that you are writing a data pipeline where you have to populate the various fields inside a car object. In order to populate these fields you have to fetch the information from various sources. You might have to query your internal database, a third party database, and other third party websites. In order to do this you decide to have a Transformer interface that takes in a Car and returns a Car with new information. The struct and the code look something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>Car</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Model</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Year</span> <span>int</span>
	<span>PremiumFeatures</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span>
	<span>NumberOfSeats</span> <span>int</span>
	<span>Insurance</span> <span>string</span>
	<span>Owners</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
	<span>SerialNumber</span> <span>string</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Transformer is the interface that we are going to use to </span>
<span>// apply various transformations to the car</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Transformer</span> <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Transform takes in a car and returns a car with updated information.</span>
	<span>Transform</span><span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This setup makes sense because we can then build different clients that interact with the different data sources to populate the car. You decide to make a database client and an http client that implment the interface:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>DBClient</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>*</span><span>DBClient</span><span>)</span> <span>Transform</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>HttpClient</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>*</span><span>HttpClient</span><span>)</span> <span>Transform</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point you are able to have a few instances and of your clients talking to different source and have them all grouped in a single array:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>collectTransformations</span><span>()</span> <span>[]</span><span>Transformer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>transformers</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>([]</span><span>Transformer</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>dbC</span> <span>:=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>DBClient</span><span>)</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
  <span>transformers</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>transformers</span><span>,</span> <span>dbC</span><span>)</span>
  <span>httpC</span> <span>:=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span><span>)</span>
  <span>/* Implementation details ... */</span>
  <span>transformers</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>transformers</span><span>,</span> <span>httpC</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Transformers now holds both DBClient and HttpClient and is ready to apply the transformations.</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But, what if we had simpler transformers that did not require an entire struct to perform the transformation? Say we need to generate the serial number or add the current year to our car. For that we can have a function implement our interface and add it to our list of transformers!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> <span>TransformFunc</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>tf</span> <span>TransformFunc</span><span>)</span> <span>Transform</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>tf</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>AddYear</span><span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Uses the current year and adds it to the car</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>AddSerialNumber</span><span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Generates serial numbers and adds it to the car</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>func</span> <span>collectTransformations</span><span>()</span> <span>[]</span><span>Transformer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* Code from previous section. */</span>
  <span>transformers</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>transformers</span><span>,</span> <span>TransformFunc</span><span>(</span><span>AddYear</span><span>))</span>
  <span>transformers</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>transformers</span><span>,</span> <span>TransformFunc</span><span>(</span><span>AddSerialNumber</span><span>))</span>
  <span>// Transformers now holds both DBClient and HttpClient AND our functions defined above.</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, we can then apply all of our transformations in a single function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>applyTransformations</span><span>(</span><span>cars</span> <span>[]</span><span>Car</span><span>,</span> <span>transformations</span> <span>[]</span><span>Transform</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>   
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>cars</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>t</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>transformations</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>cars</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>t</span><span>.</span><span>Transform</span><span>(</span><span>cars</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>])</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I think this post is long enough already but the last thing I want to mention is that you can use a similar pattern for testing your code. If you are working with a single method interface, using this pattern can save you quite a bit of time!</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c377678ef05df48ca100bc7c0c7b4ee18ae4292d/5f0ab/images/uploads/0356.jpg" alt="Cartoon About Saying Less"></p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p><strong>One of the most valuable things you could do for your software business is talk to your users.</strong> You can help them get more value from your software, learn how they use your product, hear their feedback, and demonstrate the quality and commitment of your support.</p>

<p>However, if you’ve ever tried to talk to your users by email, you probably ran into a problem:&nbsp;<strong>Many users&nbsp;don’t respond.</strong></p>

<p>Even if you follow all the best practices around emails, genuinely want to help them, and spend a long time writing a personalized email, people&nbsp;still don’t respond. That can be very frustrating.</p>

<p>Netlify—<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">a platform for static sites</a>—was feeling this frustration, so they brought me in to help.</p>

<p>Knowing that signups don’t matter if new users aren’t starting to use and get value from the software, Netlify was emailing every new user with an offer to help or answer any questions.</p>

<p>By most measures, the email was good: It was personalized, sent within&nbsp;a day, sent by a real person (their head of customer success), and had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/">no flashy design</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately it had a reply rate of just 1%.</strong> They were missing a huge opportunity by&nbsp;failing to reach 99 of every 100 users.</p>

<h2>The Solution: Saying Less</h2>
<p>When I saw the length of the original email, I suspected users are:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Not&nbsp;bothering to read it because of its length.</li>
 	<li>Assuming it's a template email because of its length, and therefore don't believe the offer to help is sincere.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I&nbsp;did was delete most of the email text&nbsp;and run an A/B test against the original…</p>

<h3>First A/B Test:&nbsp;Original vs Short Email</h3>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7fe4ca1e7b73c29c841ee396bc6a727fcf546bbd/4f5e5/images/uploads/onboarding-email-1.jpg" alt="Long Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This original email had 150+ words and a reply rate of 1% (1 of every 100 users).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0b1c850a8b4f90c586af96347a02cce4516fe5d/2c0d2/images/uploads/onboarding-email-2.jpg" alt="Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This variation&nbsp;had 37 words&nbsp;and resulted in a reply&nbsp;rate&nbsp;of 4% (1 of every 25 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the original email text by 75% increased the reply rate by 300%.</strong></p>

<p>That’s a terrific&nbsp;result for a few minutes of work. I&nbsp;could have stopped there, but wondered how far I&nbsp;could take this before seeing diminishing returns.</p>

<p>On to the second test…</p>

<h3>Second A/B Test: Short vs Very Short</h3>

<p>I&nbsp;took the winning email from the first test and cut another 50% of the text, taking out as much as possible while retaining the email’s meaning, then tested it against the previous winner.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/277ca277bbecd4e9282c4bd579557b6029cae3f1/513f3/images/uploads/onboarding-email-3.jpg" alt="Very Short Onboarding Email"></p>

<p>This version has just 14 words. It resulted in a reply rate of 8% (1 of every 12 users).</p>

<p><strong>Cutting the email text by another 50% <em>doubled</em> the&nbsp;reply rates from the previous version.</strong> Compared to the original, the length was cut by 90% and reply rates increased by 700%.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/164e960178dbe5fd0019901e2da78a68bcb38406/55ff3/images/uploads/reply-rates.png" alt="Email Reply Rates"></p>

<p><strong>Imagine you could onboard 8x more people to your software&nbsp;and hear 8x more feedback from new users.</strong> That’s the power of saying less.</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Take your welcome&nbsp;or onboarding&nbsp;email—<a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/question-for-saas-trial-users/">start here</a> if you don’t have one—and cut out any text that isn’t&nbsp;necessary. When you feel you’re done, take out another 50%. Finally,&nbsp;run an A/B test and measure positive replies to this shorter email versus your original.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description articleBody">
      <p>If you want to get anything done, there are two basic ways to&nbsp;get yourself to do it.</p>
<p>The first, more popular and devastatingly wrong option is to try to motivate yourself.</p>
<p>The second, somewhat unpopular and entirely correct choice&nbsp;is to cultivate discipline.</p>
<p>This is one of these situations where adopting a different perspective immediately results in superior outcomes. Few uses of the term “paradigm shift” are actually legitimate, but this one is. It’s a lightbulb moment.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>

<p><strong>Motivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional&nbsp;state is necessary to complete a task.</strong></p>
<p>That’s completely the wrong way around.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods and feelings <em>and thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them</em>.</strong></p>
<p>The implications are huge.</p>
<p><strong>Successful completion of tasks brings about the inner states that chronic procrastinators think they need to initiate tasks in the first place.</strong></p>
<p>Put in simpler form, <strong>you don’t wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. You train to get into olympic form.</strong></p>
<p>If action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. I know that too well, and wish somebody pointed it out for me twenty, fifteen or ten years ago before I learned the difference the hard way.</p>
<p>If you wait until you feel like doing stuff, you’re fucked. That’s precisely how the dreaded procrastinatory loops come about.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/08/Screen_Shot_2014_08_26_at_3.40.03_PM/e467ccab2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/the-procrastination-loop-and-how-to-break-it/379142/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source of picture&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing&nbsp;things we<em> feel like</em> doing. The problem is then framed thus: “How do I get myself to <em>feel like doing</em> what I have rationally decided to do?”. Bad.</p>
<p>The proper question is “How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?”.</p>
<p>The point is to cut the link between feelings and actions, and do it anyway. You get to feel good and buzzed and energetic and eager <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Motivation has this the wrong way around. I am utterly 100% convinced that this faulty frame is the main driver of the “sitting about in underwear playing Xbox, and with yourself” epidemic currently sweeping developed countries.</p>
<p>There are psychological problems with relying on motivation as well.</p>
<p>Because real life in the real world occasionally requires people do things that nobody in their right mind can be massively enthusiastic about, “motivation” runs into the insurmountable obstacle of trying to elicit enthusiasm for things that objectively do not merit it. The only solution besides slackery, then, is to put people out of their right minds. That’s a horrible, and fortunately fallacious, dilemma.</p>
<p>Trying to drum up enthusiasm for fundamentally dull and soul crushing activities is literally a form of deliberate psychological self-harm, a voluntary insanity: “I AM SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE SPREADSHEETS, I CAN’T WAIT TO FILL OUT THE EQUATION FOR FUTURE VALUE OF ANNUITY, I LOVE MY JOB SOOO MUCH!”</p>
<p>I do not consider self-inflicted episodes of hypomania the optimal driver of human activity. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thymic</a> compensation via depressive episodes is inevitable, since&nbsp;the human brain will not tolerate abuse indefinitely. There are stops and safety valves. There are hormonal hangovers.</p>
<p>The worst thing that can happen is succeeding at the wrong thing – temporarily. A far superior scenario is retaining sanity, which unfortunately tends to be misinterpreted as moral failure: <em>“I still don’t love my pointless paper-shuffling job, I must be doing something wrong.”</em> <em>“I still prefer cake to brocolli and can’t lose weight, maybe I’m just weak”.</em> <em>“I should buy another book about motivation”</em>. Bullshit. The critical error is even approaching those issues in terms of motivation or lack thereof. The answer&nbsp;is discipline, not motivation.</p>
<p>There is another, practical problem with motivation. It has a tiny shelf life, and needs constant refreshing.</p>
<p>Motivation is like manually winding up a crank to deliver a burst of force. At best, it stores and converts energy to a particular purpose. There are situations where it is the correct attitude, one-offs where getting psyched and spring-loading a metric fuckton of mental energy upfront is the best course of action. Olympic races and prison breaks come to mind. But it is a horrible basis for regular day-to-day functioning, and anything like consistent long-term results.</p>
<p>By contrast, discipline is like an engine that, once kickstarted, actually <em>supplies</em> energy to the system.</p>
<p>Productivity has no requisite mental states. For consistent, long-term results, discipline trumps motivation, runs circles around it, bangs its mom and eats its lunch.</p>
<p>In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don’t feel like it.</p>
<p>You get to feel good <em>afterwards</em>.</p>
<p>Discipline, in short, is a system, whereas motivation is analogous to goals. There is a symmetry. Discipline is more or less self-perpetuating and constant, whereas motivation is a bursty kind of thing.</p>
<p>How do you cultivate discipline? By building habits – starting as small as you can manage, even microscopic, and gathering momentum, reinvesting it in progressively bigger changes to your routine, and building a&nbsp;positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Motivation is a counterproductive attitude to productivity. What counts is discipline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A remote worker — what’s he like? Last year people would describe him as a young, laid-back traveling nomad who doesn’t have a family (read ‘kids’), doesn’t share your corporate culture, has no interest in your success, and who mainly imitates working while watching a movie or reading social media. Of course, it wasn’t true, but who would dare re-check and dispose of that?&nbsp;</p><p>With over three decades in the IT outsourcing business, we know firsthand that remote teams were previously considered risky or inefficient. It was much easier for business owners and managers to hire specialists locally and watch them coming to the office and spending eight hours at the computer.</p><p>It would be the best-case scenario, and so much simpler, if we omitted such factors as a global shortage of IT talent, lack of domain specialists, limited hiring budgets, and others. So, what has changed?&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak made thousands of executives and managers reevaluate their attitude toward permanent telecommuting and the engagement of at-home workers. On average, it took from a few days to several weeks to shift to WFH.</p><p>And about a month or two to realize that it works! Twitter, Square, Upwork, Shopify, Coinbase, Lambda School — all these companies have shifted to remote working on a permanent or long-term basis. Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Slack, Google, PayPal, Zillow, Salesforce, JPMorgan, Capital One, Mondelez, Barclays, Nationwide, Morgan Stanley, and others opt for hybrid models reducing the number of global offices and in-house employees.</p><p>The coronavirus crisis has revealed that we can operate in different ways and demonstrated that working remotely can be effective on an international scale. Consequently, in the coming years, the number of companies that are open to not only telecommuting but also offshore/nearshore partnership is projected to grow. Is your enterprise among them?</p><h2><span id="TEAM%E2%80%99s_Remote_Work_Playbook_How_to_Establish_and_Sustain_a_Healthy_EnterpriseWide_Telework_Environment"></span>TEAM’s Remote Work Playbook: How to Establish and Sustain a Healthy Enterprise-Wide Telework Environment<strong></strong><span></span></h2><p>For decades TEAM International has been among the pioneers of IT outsourcing, fostering what it means to build a dedicated software development team or full-scale research, development, and innovation center.</p><p>Our experience and best practices about productivity, technology, culture, and cooperation when your entire team is distributed globally can serve as a roadmap for enterprises struggling with new reality or planning for the future. Preparing for future pandemics, emergencies, or other disruptions, companies can seamlessly transit to fully-remote or hybrid models and thus avoid risks of not running operations for weeks, months, or years.</p><p>So what do you need to transform into one of the best telecommuting companies? Are there any tricks and tips for working remotely with no loss in productivity? How to hire and retain the top talent? All these and other answers you will find in our remote work playbook.</p><h3><span id="1_People_HiringRetaining_Tips_and_Other_Best_Practices_for_Working_Remotely"></span>#1 People: Hiring-Retaining Tips and Other Best Practices for Working Remotely<strong></strong><span></span></h3><p>People are the main asset of any business, no matter if remote or not. Recruiting only local talent actually means that you cut your applicant pool in half and may casually eliminate the most qualified individuals for the job. Meanwhile, limitless hiring capabilities are among the major benefits of permanent telecommuting that can easily evolve into a strong competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recruiting and interviewing.</strong> With better opportunities come more nuances, so having a clear sourcing strategy is critical. Start by answering the following question: are there any time zone and language fluency requirements?</p><p>Having at least a few hours overlap with the team is vital, so this point should be taken into account while choosing candidates’ locations or during the interview since your candidate should be comfortable working either later at night or earlier in the morning. Proceed with the necessary qualifications, levels of confidence, and soft skills.</p><p>Finally, analyze the candidate’s cultural fit and ability to share your corporate values and working style. When it comes to job interviews, we recommend video conferencing via Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, Skype, or Zoom.</p><p><strong>Onboarding.</strong> At TEAM International, this process may vary depending on the department or project. However, there are several remote work best practices that may facilitate and accelerate the onboarding process. Planning an enterprise-wide onboarding program is one of them.</p><p>The remote onboarding process should be consistent and straightforward; that’s why we recommend creating a digital knowledge base on SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, or any other platform with all the learning and introduction materials. Some projects also leverage online training software like Udemy or Pluralsight for various compliance courses, specific technology or tool exercises, and more.</p><p>But most importantly, communicate with newcomers across the entire onboarding process, create chats, and assign people managers to each newbie to make their adaptation effective, quick, and inspiring.</p><p><strong>Learning and development.</strong> Continuing education is an essential component of any future-proof organization, no matter remote or in-office. Such an approach enables team members to not only achieve their full potential but also improve the capabilities of the company as a whole.</p><p>We recommend looking to e-learning platforms like Lessonly, Udemy, Pluralsight, and others since they make it easier for team members to attend classes regardless of location or time zone. Additionally, when it comes to internal training for a specific project or department, we suggest using proven remote working tools like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Skype, or Hangouts and record lectures for future use.</p><h3><span id="2_Culture_Dealing_With_the_Challenges_of_Working_Remotely_to_Build_a_ValueDriven_Distributed_Team"></span>#2 Culture: Dealing With the Challenges of Working Remotely to Build a Value-Driven Distributed Team<strong></strong><span></span></h3><p>Sharing corporate values is among the most frequently mentioned concerns regarding IT outsourcingand <a href="https://www.teaminternational.com/coronavirus-vs-business-effectively-managing-remote-teams-amid-the-global-crisis/">remote team management</a>. That’s understandable since various <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/measuring-culture-in-leading-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> and <a href="https://www.tinypulse.com/hubfs/2018%20Employee%20Retention%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> prove that a healthy culture is still crucial for striking a balance between corporate agility and strategic alignment.</p><p>When employees — remote or in-office — share and rely on your culture, they gain the requisite flexibility to better adapt to the circumstances, embrace unexpected opportunities, and address the ever-changing market environment.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in the office-based environment, it’s rather easy to demonstrate a corporate culture using the so-called ‘surface elements’ like the design of physical spaces, general style of dressing, policies, overt behaviors, and more. When it comes to remote work companies and teams, the lack of shared physical spaces and elements should be compensated with strongly-pronounced values and actions (driven by these values). What does that mean?</p><p>Every employee’s behavior should reflect your corporate beliefs, including how they collaborate and communicate with others, how they hold meetings, how they deliver on the intended outcomes, or what remote working software and tools they use. When compared to the in-office model, these behaviors and principles don’t differ much. They are just materialized differently.</p><p>Regular feedback loops are another way to reinforce your social norms and sustain a healthy culture. Working with clients, we take on most activities like observing employees’ happiness and loyalty, holding follow-ups if needed, and conducting check-ups with newcomers.</p><p>With a remote worker, monitoring is performed similarly. Though you can’t ask how your colleague is doing in-person, you can quickly catch up on MS Teams or Zoom. Yes, it’s a different approach, but you get the same outcome.</p><p>Finally, one of the hottest topics associated with permanent telecommuting: how to keep remote teams engaged? — Meanwhile, daily behaviors define the cultural tone, and feedback loops help to monitor the general mood, enterprise-wide meetings provide every remote worker with insight into how the company is doing with relation to objectives, KPIs, and other initiatives.</p><p>Additionally, such activities help to enhance the overall corporate energy and encourage people to do more, as they see the results. Having employees in different locations and time zones, we recommend choosing neutral timeslots and recording meetings for those who couldn’t attend.</p><h3><span id="3_Productivity_The_Road_to_Effective_Remote_Working_is_Asynchronous_and_Adaptive"></span>#3 Productivity: The Road to Effective Remote Working is Asynchronous and Adaptive<strong></strong><span></span></h3><p>The most common misconception among business stakeholders and top managers is that telecommuting reduces productivity, so let’s start with a myth debunking. The latest remote working statistics <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-average-productivity-loss-of-remote-work-is-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> that the average productivity loss is as low as one percent.</p><p>Moreover, work-remote employees <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrate</a> a 50-percent less attrition and better performance than their office-based colleagues. That’s not to mention fewer sick leaves or PTOs and shorter breaks. So, when it comes to telecommuting, productivity is often underestimated.</p><p>At TEAM International, we believe that there are several components that make remote teams effective, and they are: transparent goals, respect for colleagues’ time, strategic alignment, and proper accountability across the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Meetings are an integral part of any teamwork, no matter office-based or distributed. But along with this, they can turn into great distractors if they’re purposeless and unpunctual. So, how to avoid that? — Our managers suggest three simple rules:</p><ol type="1"><li>A meeting organizer should create and share an agenda (along with the event invitation) that defines a meeting purpose and allows colleagues to prepare for a meeting beforehand;</li><li>Ask all the participants to keep their cameras on to prevent them from multitasking and so promote their attentiveness;</li><li>Review your recurring meetings, and don’t be afraid to cancel any of them and notify your colleagues as soon as possible. Moreover, feel free to end calls earlier if there is nothing more to discuss. Respect each other’s time.</li></ol><p>Strong alignment and accountability go hand in hand with clearly-defined …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <div>
                <div><p>As a teenager, I always thought that the term “alpha male” sounded cool and powerful and worthy of pursuit. What it meant to me from how mainstream culture communicated it to me was to be dominating, strong, talking over people, and generally being on top.</p>
<p>When I reflected on this more over time, it quickly felt icky and didn’t align at all with my values and with the values we were putting in place when I was building software as an entrepreneur with a fully transparent culture. I felt inclined to almost shun the term “alpha” as being overly aggressive, negative, and violent.</p>
<p>Recently this changed, when I came across the actual research that in part coined the term “alpha male” by primatologist Frans de Waal. Although the term was first used in the 50s and 60s to describe research on wolves and how packs organized themselves, it was de Waal and others that dug much deeper into the topic of alphas in the last 40 years or so since the 70s and 80s.<br>
What de Waal observed in numerous studies remains highly counter to the traditional ideas mainstream society has adopted when it comes to the terminology alpha male.</p>
<h2>The most empathetic member of the group is the alpha</h2>
<p>One of the things that completely baffled me, but upon closer inspection, makes a lot of sense, was his finding that any alpha in a group of chimpanzees always happens to be the most empathetic member. He analyzed this by studying empathic behavior like consoling, hugging and other indicating moves. Although generally females in any group tend to offer more empathetic behavior to the members of the group, when it comes to the alpha, they show a level of empathy that is way off the charts compared to the rest.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-23-at-2.00.01-PM.png" alt="" width="904" height="511" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-23-at-2.00.01-PM.png 904w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-23-at-2.00.01-PM-300x170.png 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-23-at-2.00.01-PM-768x434.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px"><br>
He compared this to leaders, particularly in politics, where, especially when it comes to moments of election or moments of a coalition, the degree of empathetic behavior goes way up.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, although not always the case, I have also found that some of the most, most successful people that I know have also learned to develop a huge degree of empathy for the people that surround them.</p>

<h2>Alphas are the most stressed members of a group</h2>
<p>A second insight that I took from de Waal’s research, was that the stress level of the highest-ranking members of a group, as he studied it in chimpanzees and bonobos were also the most stressed members of the group.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.19.18-PM.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="502" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.19.18-PM.jpg 907w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.19.18-PM-300x166.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.19.18-PM-768x425.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"></p>
<p>De Waal calls this one of the “costs of power”, where in order to maintain a high ranking status in a group, it’s extremely important to stay vigilant, which in turn increases long-term stress levels significantly.</p>
<p>Surprisingly here, the lowest stress levels are among those members of the group that are second in place, which seem to enjoy all the benefits of security and good-standing, but don’t share the fear of being toppled, like the person in the alpha-position.</p>
<h2>Coalitions and partnerships outperform individual performance</h2>
<p>A final takeaway that I found extremely powerful from de Waal’s research was that being or becoming an alpha, although in part relying on one’s individual strength and charisma, also largely depended on one’s ability to form long-term partnership and coalitions.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.25.22-PM.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="508" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.25.22-PM.jpg 907w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.25.22-PM-300x168.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.25.22-PM-768x430.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPsSKKL8N0s">In a Ted talk de Waal explains</a> how in the above picture, the male on the right is individually the strongest. However the male in the middle, since forming a coalition with the much older male on the left, is the alpha and undoubtedly so over the years.</p>
<p>My own takeaways for leadership and human connection</p>
<p>The term “alpha” translates into “leader” for me. What encourages me from seeing how alphas operate in societies like chimps, that are genetically closest to us as humans, is how much focus there lies naturally on empathy and partnership.</p>
<p>I notice that the more I work with leaders and CEOs in particular that the more empathetic they become, the better partnerships they are able to form and the more successful those become that take to a more empathetic lens to lead their businesses.</p>
<p>When I reflect on my <a href="https://leowid.com/10-life-lessons-i-learned-from-living-with-buddhist-monks-nuns-for-a-year/">life in a Buddhist monastery</a>, the values of empathy, understanding, and collaboration were naturally placed on the forefront of peacefully living together. Since then, I’m also coming to the realization, that not just for the life of a Buddhist monk or nun, it is those same human qualities that support us on any path of life, whether as a CEO, leader, or any person in the world at all.</p>
<p>The more we all learn to <a href="https://leowid.com/stress-release/">deal with stress,</a> and develop <a href="https://leowid.com/the-startup-empathy-dilemma-as-power-and-impact-grows-empathy-diminishes/">our ability to remain empathetic</a>, first towards ourselves, but then also towards our fellow people in our communities, the more beautifully and powerfully life can unfold.</p>
<p><strong>I coach from the idea that successful and happy &amp; fulfilled are not at odds with each other. And that both aspects need careful tending if we wish for it in our lives.</strong> To see that the qualities that support happiness, also support the qualities of success, although I feel this deeply as my own truth, is a welcome surprise to seem to emerge similarly from this research.</p>
<h2>Alpha females</h2>
<p>What I find somewhat disappointing, was the lacking research on female alphas, which are most present in matriarchical societies like the bonobos. The fact that we have studied alpha males so much more than alpha females sends a strong message in itself.</p>
<p>The one example de Waal does share in his research was about an alpha female by the name of “mama”. What was obvious from her empathetic behavior, was that although she lacked the physical strength to compete with the males, her level of consoling was to a degree that brought such unity and loyalty, that her being the centre of the group was natural.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.33.30-PM.jpg" alt="" width="911" height="503" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.33.30-PM.jpg 911w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.33.30-PM-300x166.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-2.33.30-PM-768x424.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px"></p>
<h2>Questions that sprung out of this for me</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be the leader of a group?<br>
How can we learn to cope with the “costs of power”, particularly in relation to stress levels?<br>
In order to grow, how much emphasis do you place on your capacity to have empathy and to form long-term partnerships?</p>

<h2> Haskell Language Server, binaries and installation </h2>
<p>
    Posted on July 24, 2020 by <a href="https://github.com/bubba">Luke Lau</a>
    <span><img src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/bubba.png"></span>
</p>

<p>If you’ve ever had to install <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> or <em>haskell-language-server</em>, you might be aware that it is quite a lengthy process. There are several reasons for this, two of the most significant being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both <em>haskell-ide-engine</em> and <em>haskell-language-server</em> act as a kitchen sink for plugins. These plugins all depend on the corresponding tool from Hackage, and as a result they end up pulling in <strong>a lot</strong> of transient dependencies.</li>
<li>The GHC API that powers the underlying <em>ghcide</em> session only works on projects that match <strong>the same</strong> GHC version as it was compiled with. This means that in order to support multiple GHC versions (which is quite common with Stack projects that can define a specific version of GHC) the install script needs to build a binary of <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> <strong>for every single GHC version</strong> that is supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the purpose of the <em>hie-wrapper</em>/<em>haskell-language-server-wrapper</em> executable. The <code>install.hs</code> script will install binaries for every version under <code>haskell-language-server-8.6.5</code>, <code>haskell-language-server-8.8.3</code>, etc. The wrapper is then used in place of the language server, and will detect what version of GHC the project is using and launch the appropriate version of <em>hie</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em>.</p>
<p>Building all these different binaries with several different versions of GHC means you need to build every single dependency multiple times over, leading to some hefty build times and chewing through a lot of disk space. On top of this, installation from source is the <em>only</em> supported installation method so far. This isn’t great for newcomers or for those who just want to setup a working IDE in a pinch. So many of us have spent the past month hard at work trying to improve the installation story.</p>

<p>One obvious solution would be to just provide static binaries. This has been a <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1068">long running discussion</a>, that dates all the way back to <em>haskell-ide-engine</em>. When we say static binaries, we mean a binary that has no dynamically linked libraries. You can test that by running <code>ldd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-wrapper
    linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff185de000)
    libz.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007faa3a937000)
    libtinfo.so.5 =&gt; /usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00007faa3a8d2000)
    librt.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c7000)
    libutil.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libutil.so.1 (0x00007faa3a8c2000)
    libdl.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007faa3a8bc000)
    libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007faa3a89a000)
    libgmp.so.10 =&gt; /usr/lib/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007faa3a7f7000)
    libm.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007faa3a6b2000)
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007faa3a4eb000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007faa3a9ab000)</code></pre>
<p>That’s a lot of linked libraries, all of which will need to be available on the users machine if we were just to ship the binary like that. With cabal-install, we can statically link these with just <code>cabal build --enable-exeutable-static</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ldd haskell-language-server-Linux-8.10.1 
	not a dynamic executable</code></pre>
<p>However one big caveat is that this only works on Linux. macOS doesn’t really have a notion of truly static binaries, since the system libraries are only provided as dylibs. The best we can do is just ensure that the only dynamically linked libraries are the ones already provided by the system, which it looks like it was in the first place!</p>
<pre><code>$ otool -L haskell-language-server
haskell-language-server:
	/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib (compatibility version 5.4.0, current version 5.4.0)
	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1281.100.1)
	/usr/lib/libcharset.1.dylib (compatibility version 2.0.0, current version 2.0.0)</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, making a static binary is one thing, but having that binary be portable is another. If we want the binary to run on other machines outside of the host, it can’t rely on data-files, which some <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/issues/1143">plugins such as <em>hlint</em> used</a>. And the same goes for any <code>libexec</code> binaries, which <em>cabal-helper</em> took advantage of.</p>
<p>Once these were <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/pull/824">taken care of upstream</a>, we then had to deal with GHC library directory: This is a directory that comes with your GHC installation, typically in something like <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> or in <code>~/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.10.1/lib/ghc-8.10.1/</code> for Stack. Inside it contains all the compiled <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Library_submissions#The_Libraries">core libraries</a>, as well as the actual ghc executable itself: Your <code>/usr/bin/ghc</code> is most likely a script that just launches the binary in the library directory!</p>

<p>Either way, <em>ghcide</em>/<em>haskell-language-server</em> use the GHC API, which <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-8.10.1/docs/GHC.html#v:runGhc">needs to know where this directory is</a> to do it’s job:</p>

<p>The most common way to get the path to the library directory is through the <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs"><em>ghc-paths</em></a> package, which uses <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-paths/blob/master/Setup.hs">some custom <code>Setup.hs</code> magic</a> to work out where the library directory is, for the GHC <strong>that is being used to compile the program</strong>. It bakes in the paths at compile time, which means it’s portable if we share the source and build it on other systems. But if we build it on one system where the library directory is at <code>/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code> for example, then when <strong>distributing the binary</strong> to another system it will still try looking for the old path which resides on a completely different machine! For example, if GHC was installed via ghcup on the other system, then the library directory would reside at <code>~/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.1/lib/</code>: a very different location.</p>
<p>So if we want to be able to distribute these binaries and have them actually run on other systems, <em>ghc-paths</em> is out of the question. This means that we have to somehow get the library directory oureslves <strong>at runtime</strong>. Thankfully, the <code>ghc</code> executable has a handy command for this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ghc --print-libdir
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.10.1</code></pre>
<p>We could just call this directly. But what if you had a Cabal project, configured with <code>cabal configure -wghc-8.8.3</code> whilst the <code>ghc</code> on your PATH was version 8.10.1? Then the library directories would have mismatching verisons! What we can do instead however is:</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal exec ghc -- --print-libdir
Resolving dependencies...
/usr/local/lib/ghc-8.8.3</code></pre>
<p>And consider even the case for Stack, where it downloads GHC for you. Well, we can do the same thing as Cabal:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack exec ghc -- --print-libdir
/Users/luke/.stack/programs/x86_64-osx/ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5</code></pre>
<p>These commands are tool specific, so it only made perfect sense to put this logic into <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hie-bios"><em>hie-bios</em></a>, our library for interfacing and setting up GHC sessions with various tools. Now there’s an API for cradles to specify how to execute the <code>ghc</code> executable that they use when building themselves.</p>

<p>The build process is automated across a wide range of platforms and GHC versions on GitHub Actions, which gets triggered everytime a release is made. Previously setting up Haskell on Travis CI/CircleCI/AppVeyor used to be pretty fiddly, but the <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-haskell">setup-haskell</a> action for GitHub has made dramatic strides recently. In just a few lines of yaml we can setup a rather hefty build matrix for all the verisons we support:</p>
<pre><code>  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        ghc: ['8.10.1', '8.8.3', '8.8.2', '8.6.5', '8.6.4']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest]
        exclude:
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.3' # fails due to segfault
          - os: windows-latest
            ghc: '8.8.2' # fails due to error with Cabal</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Now that's what I call a build matrix" src="https://mpickering.github.io/ide/images/github-actions-matrix.png" height="300">
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the story of Haskell on Windows is a bit hairy as usual, so there were a few bumps that needed worked around. The biggest and most annoying one by far was hitting the <code>MAX_PATH</code> limit for file paths whenever we tried to build the <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> executable. Admittedly this is a rather long name for a binary, but a combination of the fact that GitHub actions checks out the source directory in <code>D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server</code> and how Cabal’s per-component builds nest build products crazy deep meant that we we’re constantly going over the rather stringent 260 character limit:</p>
<pre><code>Linking D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper.exe ...
55
realgcc.exe: error: D:\a\haskell-language-server\haskell-language-server\dist-newstyle\build\x86_64-windows\ghc-8.10.1\haskell-language-server-0.1.0.0\x\haskell-language-server-wrapper\build\haskell-language-server-wrapper\haskell-language-server-wrapper-tmp\Paths_haskell_language_server.o: No such file or directory
56
`gcc.exe' failed in phase `Linker'. (Exit code: 1)</code></pre>
<p>We tried several things including</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later">LongPathsEnabled registry key</a> to disable this restriction. But it turns out it was already on the entire time and <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/13373">GHC/GCC aren’t using the right Windows API calls</a></li>
<li>Checking out the code in a different root directory, but it doesn’t seem to be possible with GitHub actions</li>
<li>Squashing the build directory with just <code>--build-dir=b</code> – still left us 2 characters over the limit!</li>
<li>Disabling per-component builds – just fails with another build error</li>
</ul>
<p>But at the end of the day, the only reliable solution was just to rename <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> to something shorter whilst building:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Shorten binary names
  shell: bash
  run: |
    sed -i.bak -e 's/haskell-language-server/hls/g' \
               -e 's/haskell_language_server/hls/g' \
               haskell-language-server.cabal
    sed -i.bak -e 's/Paths_haskell_language_server/Paths_hls/g' \
               src/**/*.hs exe/*.hs</code></pre>
<p>There’s still some sporadic issues with <a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6986">Cabal on Windows</a> and GitHub Actions having infrastructure outages so the builds aren’t 100% flake free yet, but it does provide a rather large build …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>What is DevOps?</strong></h2>



<p>The DevOps methodology, a software and team management approach defined by the portmanteau of Development and Operations, was first coined in 2009 and has since become a buzzword concept in the IT field. </p>



<p>DevOps has come to mean many things to each individual who uses the term as DevOps is not a singularly defined standard, software, or process but more of a culture. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/devops" target="_blank">Gartner</a> defines DevOps as:</p>



<p><em>“DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology—especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.”</em></p>



<p>As you can see from the above definition, DevOps is a multi-faceted approach to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), but its main underlying strength is how it leverages technology and software to streamline this process. So with the right approach to DevOps, notably adopting its philosophies of co-operation and implementing the right tools, your business can increase deployment frequency by a factor of 30 and lead times by a factor of 8000 over traditional methods, according to a CapGemini <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/de-de/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/devops-the-future-of-application-lifecycle-automation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>The Right Tools for the Job</strong></h2>



<p>This list is designed to be as comprehensive as possible. The article comprises both very well established tools for those who are new to the DevOps methodology and those tools that are more recent releases to the market—either way there is bound to be a tool on here that can be an asset for you and your business. For those who already live and breathe DevOps, we hope you find something that will assist you in your growing enterprise.</p>



<p>With such a litany of tools to choose from, there is no “right” answer to what tools you should adopt. No single tool will cover all your needs, and will be deployed across a variety of development and Operational teams, so let’s break down what you need to consider before choosing what tool might work for you.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plan and collaborate:</strong> Before you even begin the SDLC, your business needs to have a cohesive idea of what tools they’ll need to implement across your teams. There are even DevOps tools that can assist you with this first crucial step.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Build:</strong> Here you want tools that create identically provisioned environments. The last you need is to hear “But it works for me on my computer”</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Automation:</strong> This has quickly become a given in DevOps, but automation will always drastically increase production over manual methods.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Tools need to provide constant and immediate feedback, several times a day but not all integrations are implemented equally, will the tool you select be right for the job?</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployments need to be kept predictable, smooth and reliable with minimal risks, automation will also play a big part in this process.</li></ul>



<p>With all that in mind, I hope this selection of tools will aid you as your business continues to expand into the DevOps lifestyle.</p>

<h2>3. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Deployment Manager</a></strong></h2>



<p>Much like the tools mentioned above, Google Cloud Deployment Manager is Google’s IAC tool for the Google Cloud Platform. This tool utilizes YAML for its config files, and JINJA2 or PYTHON for its templates. Some of its notable features are synchronistic deployment and ‘preview’, allowing you an overhead view of changes before they are committed.</p>

<h2>4. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a></strong></h2>



<p>Terraform is brought to you by HashiCorp, the makers of Vault and Nomad. Terraform is vastly different from the above mentioned tools in that it is not restricted to a specific cloud environment, this comes with increased benefits for tackling complex distributed applications without being tied to a single platform. And much like Google Cloud Deployment Manager, Terraform also has a preview feature.</p>

<h2>5. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra/" target="_blank">Chef</a></strong></h2>



<p>Chef is an ideal choice for those who favor CI/CD. At its heart, Chef utilizes self-described recipes, templates, and cookbooks; a collection of ready-made templates. Cookbooks allow for consistent configuration even as your infrastructure rapidly scales. All of this is wrapped up in a beautiful Ruby-based DSL pie.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://puppet.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a></strong></h2>



<p>Puppet may be the oldest IAC tool on this list, and with that comes a lot of experience and maturity in its field, and a bustling community behind it. What sets Puppet apart is its approach to IAC setup and automation, as with Puppet, you’ll need to define a declarative state and Puppet will figure out how best to achieve said <a id="1">state</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>22 Jul 2020</span></p><p>In C++11 and later, we have language support for lambda expressions,
so we can write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int count_even( int const * first, int const * last )
{
    return std::count_if( first, last, []( int x )
        { return x % 2 == 0; } );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>char const * find_whitespace( char const * first, char const * last )
{
    return std::find_if( first, last, []( char ch )
        { return ch == ' ' || ch == '\t'
            || ch == '\r' || ch == '\n'; } );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but people
<a href="https://brevzin.github.io/c++/2020/06/18/lambda-lambda-lambda/">aren’t quite happy</a>.
Compared to other languages, that’s a verbose way to express a simple inline
function object, they say.</p>

<p>And you know what? They are right. It is. Here’s how these looked like
in the dark ages of C++03, when we had to use primitive tools such as
<a href="https://www.boost.org/libs/lambda">Boost.Lambda</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int count_even( int const * first, int const * last )
{
    return std::count_if( first, last, _1 % 2 == 0 );
}

char const * find_whitespace( char const * first, char const * last )
{
    return std::find_if( first, last,
        _1 == ' ' || _1 == '\t' || _1 == '\r' || _1 == '\n' );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We kind of went backwards here. How about we recreate the Boost.Lambda
experience in C++14, using <em>modern technology</em>; how many lines would
that take?</p>

<p>I asked a highly representative sample of C++ developers (two people
chosen at random) and they answered “3,000” and “5,000”, respectively.</p>

<p>They couldn’t have been more wrong if they tried. The correct answer is <strong>52</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, implementing a lambda library that makes the above two examples
compile and work literally fits into a blog post, as I shall demonstrate:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;functional&gt;
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;

template&lt;class T, class T2 = std::remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt;
    using is_lambda_expression = std::integral_constant&lt;bool,
        std::is_placeholder&lt;T2&gt;::value ||
        std::is_bind_expression&lt;T2&gt;::value&gt;;

template&lt;class A&gt; using enable_unary_lambda =
    std::enable_if_t&lt;is_lambda_expression&lt;A&gt;::value&gt;;

#define UNARY_LAMBDA(op, fn) \
    template&lt;class A, class = enable_unary_lambda&lt;A&gt;&gt; \
    auto operator op( A&amp;&amp; a ) \
    { \
        return std::bind( std::fn&lt;&gt;(), std::forward&lt;A&gt;(a) ); \
    }

template&lt;class A, class B&gt; using enable_binary_lambda =
    std::enable_if_t&lt;is_lambda_expression&lt;A&gt;::value ||
        is_lambda_expression&lt;B&gt;::value&gt;;

#define BINARY_LAMBDA(op, fn) \
    template&lt;class A, class B, class = enable_binary_lambda&lt;A, B&gt;&gt; \
    auto operator op( A&amp;&amp; a, B&amp;&amp; b ) \
    { \
        return std::bind( std::fn&lt;&gt;(), std::forward&lt;A&gt;(a), \
            std::forward&lt;B&gt;(b) ); \
    }

BINARY_LAMBDA(+, plus)
BINARY_LAMBDA(-, minus)
BINARY_LAMBDA(*, multiplies)
BINARY_LAMBDA(/, divides)
BINARY_LAMBDA(%, modulus)
UNARY_LAMBDA(-, negate)

BINARY_LAMBDA(==, equal_to)
BINARY_LAMBDA(!=, not_equal_to)
BINARY_LAMBDA(&gt;, greater)
BINARY_LAMBDA(&lt;, less)
BINARY_LAMBDA(&gt;=, greater_equal)
BINARY_LAMBDA(&lt;=, less_equal)

BINARY_LAMBDA(&amp;&amp;, logical_and)
BINARY_LAMBDA(||, logical_or)
UNARY_LAMBDA(!, logical_not)

BINARY_LAMBDA(&amp;, bit_and)
BINARY_LAMBDA(|, bit_or)
BINARY_LAMBDA(^, bit_xor)
UNARY_LAMBDA(~, bit_not)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This even generates <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fMM4bs">reasonably</a>
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1sq56o">efficient</a> <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KxM1oe">code</a>.</p>

<p>What’s the trick here?</p>

<p>The trick is that the author of <code>std::bind</code> included, quite consciously,
a few foundational bits that make implementing the above lambda library
trivial, as long as we have function objects corresponding to all the
operators we want to support; and then, in C++14 a different unrelated proposal
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3421.htm">added</a>
the exact function objects we need.</p>

<p>In the corporate circles this is known as “synergy”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not the end of the world, not the end of programming, but the end of the web development industry as we know it. Let me explain.</p>&nbsp;<h2>First glimpse of GPT-3</h2><p>Somebody posted this tweet during last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PevpUBgwpbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWIW</a>. I just brushed it off because I thought it's a project of someone who's messing around with machine learning. It took me a while to realize that the technology underneath is built by <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>. </p>&nbsp;<p>I realized that I was already describing GPT-3 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2WtILkz0fI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my talk</a>, but I thought that it's going to arrive at some distant point in the future.</p>&nbsp;<p>During the TWIW stream, we discussed a couple of things that GPT-3 can do (for now), but I still didn't take it that seriously... until I started reading a bit about it before going to bed. Did you read that correctly? </p>&nbsp;<p>Researching about an AI that's gonna absolutely change web development as we know it - <em>before</em> going to sleep. </p>&nbsp;<p>Worst. Idea. Ever. </p>&nbsp;<p>Of course, I didn't fall asleep easily because THIS MOTHERFUCKER CAN TRANSLATE PLAIN ENGLISH TO SQL.</p>&nbsp;<p>What?!  Why is everybody not losing their frickin' minds over this?!?! I might know why.</p>&nbsp;<h2>The spoiled web industry</h2><p>When the COVID situation escalated and everyone had to start working remotely, there was a tweet (that I couldn't find, obviously) from an engineer at Google who complained that now they would have to make coffee at home. I'm sorry, <em>what</em>? </p>&nbsp;<p>Are we talking about the same old coffee that everyone drinks? The coffee that literally takes a few minutes to make? Or do you have a special Unicorn-Tears-Infused-Double-Googleccino-With-The-G-Logo-Drawn-With-Foam coffee? Wait, who the fuck are you, Madonna? The lead singer of Queen? The goddamn Queen herself?! </p>&nbsp;<p>It's amazing that this industry full of rockstars and ninjas got so spoiled that we cannot even make coffee at home, so of course we got so comfortable in our positions, that we're not even scared of a goddamn AI. </p>&nbsp;<p>But, it is inevitable. The rockstar web developer dream is starting to crack a little bit, and it will be absolutely shattered one day, of course, with the help of no-code tools and AI.</p>&nbsp;<p>I hate when people say this, but... </p>&nbsp;<p>"I'm <em>soooo</em> here for it".</p>&nbsp;<h2>We're code plumbers</h2><p>Web developers get offended when someone takes a jab at their 2 favorite "languages": HTML and CSS. Noticed the quotes? I was trolling, but someone just stopped reading this article and started a tweet because they are offended by it and I'm <em>sooooo</em> here for it. </p>&nbsp;<p>I could give a fuck if you call them languages or not, the funny thing here is the entitlement and pride people take in their webdev work. The most hilarious thing in the world is people putting "senior craftsman of wonderful web experiences" or "web engineer and ninja architect of structural and delightful web adventures" </p>&nbsp;<p>HEY. You. Yeah, I'm talking to you, the person googling "splice vs slice" and "align-content vs justify-content" for the goddamn 3104813th time. AI is not gonna replace <em>your</em> job? </p>&nbsp;<p>YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO COMBINE 4 API CALLS TO MAKE A PERFORMANT LIST OF 15 RECTANGLES EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE SWITCHED 7 FRAMEWORKS IN YOUR CAREER SO FAR. </p>&nbsp;<p>If you browse the entire internet you will literally find only 7 animations in total. Everything else is static, janky, and mostly ugly. You know why? Because the web platform sucks.</p>&nbsp;<p>Our job is to glue together a bunch of random libraries that don't work together and slap them on top of a framework to achieve the same damn layout that we're building for the past 30 years. You're a code plumber, just like me, and just like everybody else that works on the web. Deal with it. </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, but instead of Bootstrap columns, you're using CSS Grid and instead of FileZilla, you're using a CI. So it's <em>totally</em> different now. Congrats, that makes you a senior ninja superstar developer.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>sigh</em></p>&nbsp;<p><em>another sigh</em></p>&nbsp;<p><em>an audible sigh that made my dog close his eyes a little bit because he felt an incoming breeze</em> </p>&nbsp;<h2>History is repeating itself</h2><p>The problem is that most people don't want to let go of the way things <em>are</em> until it's too late. This is not a web developer problem, it's a human problem. </p>&nbsp;<p>I'll ride my horse forever so get the hell out of here with those machines on 4 wheels brought here by the devil.</p><p><img alt="a" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nU8UVOLK4oE/V5hCL4caEYI/AAAAAAAAKpE/7YLXw6924Yw6wX-m6EeyQCKb__bXsvwewCLcB/s1600/Tobacco%2BFactory%2BReaders%2B2.jpg"></p>&nbsp;<p>How about the factory lector who was super confident that he has a stable job and he was reading the newspaper every day until one sunny day the radio was invented and slapped that silly hat out of their head? </p>&nbsp;<p>Anything that could be automated <em>will</em> be automated (unless you know how to fix a printer, that job will exist forever)</p><p>There are tons of similar automation examples throughout history, so it's so <em>obvious</em> that most of the webdev things will be automated. That's why it's so mindblowing how many web devs are ignorant of that fact:</p>&nbsp;<p>AI will take my job? Naaaah, I'll probably keep getting paid an insane amount of money for increasing the amount of <code>9</code>s in <code>z-index</code> <em>forever</em>. AI can't touch this.</p><p>(Actually, when you think about it, it's a goddamn miracle that we convinced a frickin' AI to write CSS instead of burning the entire web platform and starting from scratch, so that's a win for humans)</p>&nbsp;<h2>Moving on and letting go</h2><p>Everyone is scared of the unfamiliar, so they're defending the way things <em>are</em> and they're praying they're going to <em>stay</em> that way. I mean who wouldn't want to continue making a shit ton of money by telling clients they are working on "internal fixes for optimizing performance" while tweaking their precious Vim setup most of the day? </p>&nbsp;<p>I'm noticing this pattern in the webdev world over and over again:   </p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>The first time I introduced Angular 1 to the company I worked for, everyone who mastered jQuery <em>hated</em> it and "didn't see" the benefits of a framework.  </li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>The Angular 1 developers (including me) didn't like JSX at a first glance.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Like many of you, I have come up with (what I thought were) great API business ideas in the past. After a bit of digging, I would always get turned off by the number of necessary features. Or I would get overwhelmed by the amount of options for everything from billing to email to deployment.</p>
<p>My intention is to document my efforts shipping <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>, and will be a multi-part series covering everything from initial user authentication to actual production code deployment. <a href="https://github.com/sphuff/mvp-api">I’ve also made my scaffolding code available on Github</a>, so you can extend the skeleton code to fit your own needs. Keep in mind that I am in no way claiming my approaches outlined here are the “right” way to do it - I am merely documenting what has worked for me (and hopefully will help some others along the way).</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<h2 id="whatwellbebuilding">What we'll be building</h2>
<p>It'll be helpful to start with a high-level overview of what we want to achieve with this project. Rather than rattling off general terms, let's try and think about about our goals in terms of what our users will experience.</p>
<p>First, our users will hit our landing page. It'll contain some copy to explain the product, but more importantly - it will contain a sign up form. This will be a form where they input their email and then are redirected to Stripe checkout.</p>
<p>Next, we will need the billing code to tie together our user information and their purchasing decision. For our purposes, this will be a simple webhook endpoint that Stripe can hit to notify us of checkouts.</p>
<p>One the user has completed their purchase, they are redirected to the app page. From there, they will be able to see API key information. They can then start making API requests, which we'll need to authenticate.</p>
<p>What if the user wants to come back to their app page to view their API keys again? We'll need a way for them to sign back in.</p>
<p>Lastly, we'll need a deployment setup in order to push out future API code.</p>
<p>With all that boilerplate, we should have everything we need for a simple API MVP.</p>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>If you were paying attention earlier, you might have noticed that we need two kinds of authentication. One will authenticate users to the API portal, while the other will authenticate API requests. To keep things simple, we'll create separate data models for both cases. User information will be stored in the <code>User</code> model, while API access information will be stored in the <code>API Key</code> (more on this later).</p>
<h3 id="initialsetup">Initial Setup</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">100</a> <a href="https://auth0.com/">different</a> <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">approaches</a> to user authentication. I personally like being able to touch my own test data, so I opted to spin up a local docker Postgres instance during initial development. The setup is really straightforward - it’s just the Postgres docker image and necessary environment variables. <a href="https://github.com/sphuff/api-mvp/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">You can find the setup here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a> set up, starting the database should be as easy as <code>docker-compose up -d</code> . Since I am using Postgres, I would then check on the database with <code>psql -h localhost -d db_name -U username</code>. It shouldn’t have anything in it, but the practice gives you a good gut check.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll move on to the actual population of user/API key data. I am using <a href="https://sequelize.org/">sequelize</a> as my ORM, because it is well-used and well-documented. Using an ORM is incredibly helpful because it prevents you from having to right the messy SQL commands yourself (been there, wouldn’t recommend it). Regardless of which ORM you choose, this will be the part when you initialize the project and create your User and API Key models. For now, let’s just set up the <code>User</code> model with an email field, and the <code>API Key</code> model with public and private key fields. The API key model will also have a foreign key reference to the User, since each user can have multiple keys. If you’re feeling like an overachiever, you can also add a boolean activity status field to track whether the API key can be used.</p>
<p>Run the following setup commands:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g sequelize-cli # We'll need this to run the init command

yarn add sequelize 

sequelize init # will create a bunch of scaffolding code. If you don't like the default structure, you can move things around and let sequelize know in .sequelizerc
</code></pre>
<p>And create model migrations in the following form:</p>
<pre><code>User{
    "id": 1,
    "email": "test@email.com",
    "createdAt": "2020-07-21 00:26:15.105+00",
    "updatedAt": "2020-07-21 00:26:15.105+00"
}

APIKey{
    "id": 1,
    "publicKey": "myPublicKey",
    "privateKey": "myPrivateKey",
    "userId": 1,
    "isActive": false,
    "createdAt": "2020-07-21 00:26:15.105+00",
    "updatedAt": "2020-07-21 00:26:15.105+00"
}
</code></pre>
<p>After that’s done, we’ll create the DB and and run the necessary migration to add these tables to it. Set up the database with <code>sequelize db:create</code>, and run the migrations with <code>sequelize db:migrate</code>. Now that we’ve got our two main models set up, we can move on to the actual authentication piece.</p>
<h3 id="userauthentication">User Authentication</h3>
<p>Like I said earlier, there are a ton of different ways to handle user authentication. The common approach is to authenticate the user based on their username and password. Password authentication comes with some extra complexity. For instance, you need to make sure the password is securely stored (no plaintext). You'll also usually want to provide a way for the user to reset their password in case they lose track of it.</p>
<p>The other approach (that I have opted to go for) is passwordless authentication. Rather than having them enter their info, my approach would email the user a temporary login link. A big benefit of passwordless login is that you have one less sensitive data point to keep track of. You also don't need to build out a "forgot password" flow, since they no longer need a password. The main drawback is that it can be an annoying user experience, since it is higher friction than a traditional login. Since API clients shouldn't have to login often, we have a strong case for passwordless.</p>
<p>The actual email code we'll get to in another section, so for now we'll just be implementing the login token flow.</p>
<p>To get moving, we'll need to create a new model for the login token, and check against it in tha auth route. The login token itself is a randomly generated string associated with a user - think <code>{"token": "myRandomString", userId: 1}</code>.</p>
<p>You'll create the login token code, and then authenticate against it like so:</p>
<pre><code>router.get('/login', async (req, res) =&gt; {
    const { token } = req.query;
    try {
        await AuthController.validateLoginToken(token);
        
        // ten day cookie keeps them logged in
        res.cookie('login_token', token, { expires: new Date(Date.now() + TEN_DAYS_IN_MS) });
        res.redirect(`/`);
    } catch(err) { handleError(err, res) }
});
</code></pre>
<p><code>validateLoginToken</code> is just checking to see if the generated auth token exists in the database.</p>
<p>Now we've got a way for users to login - a login token is created, and we authenticate against that token. Let's move on to API key authentication.</p>
<h3 id="apiauthentication">API Authentication</h3>
<p>First, we’ll need to set up our basic authentication middleware. In express, this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.use(async (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    // here is where we will check the bearer token to make sure they are a valid user
    
    next();
});

router.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; res.send('You made it past'))
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, our middleware isn't helping us out much, so we'll need to add in that authentication logic. Before we do that, we should talk about bearer token validation.</p>
<h4 id="bearertokenauth">Bearer Token Auth</h4>
<p>Bearer token authentication is an authentication strategy in which the provider checks the <code>Authorization</code> header for some kind of string token, and uses that to extrapolate which valid user (if any) is requesting access. For instance, let's say you have one user for your service, and you really couldn't care less about security. Let's call your one user Jim. Jim could pass <code>Bearer Jim</code> in the <code>Authorization</code> header, and every time you see that token, you know that a valid user is requesting access. If Toby were to snoop on Jim's API call, he would easily see what was happening, and could gain access to your system by sending <code>Bearer Jim</code>.</p>
<p>Actual bearer authentication is a little more clever than that, but comes with the same risks. Clients will need to be using HTTPS, and should only be sending a request from their servers rather than in-browser.</p>
<p>Our implementation will append the public and private keys together to create a cryptographic hash. The authentication code above will now become:</p>
<pre><code>const isValidBearerToken = (bearerToken) =&gt; {
    if (!bearerToken || !bearerToken.includes('Bearer)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // take out "Bearer" piece
    const token = bearerToken.split('Bearer').pop();

    // base64 decoding to public:private
    const bearerTokenStringDecoded = Buffer.from(token, 'base64').toString('utf8');

    // split by colon
    const keyArr = bearerTokenStringDecoded.split(':');
    const publicKey = keyArr[0] ? keyArr[0].trim() : null;
    const privateKey = keyArr[1] ? keyArr[1].trim() : null;
    return publicKey &amp;&amp; privateKey;
}

router.use(async (req, res, next) =&gt; {
    const { authorization: bearerToken } = req.headers;
    if (isValidBearerToken(bearerToken)) {
        // next, check if API key is active
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(401).send('Nope');
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>We would also want to check that the API key is active before we let it through to our API routes. Since our routing code is getting a bit cluttered, now would also be a good time to break out the authentication logic into a separate module.</p>
<p>If you're still following along, we now have a general-purpose way of authenticting API clients and users.</p>
<p>That should wrap it up for the time being. Next time, I'll be talking about how to start collecting payments using <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-1-introduction-and-user-authentication/stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        <p>Published on: 2020-07-24</p>
        
<p>I should start this post by saying that I am a layman when it comes to everything I'm going to be discussing here.</p>
<p>However, I am left in an unfortunate position where all of the focus for applying healthspan-extending interventions in humans is focused on older individuals. This is understandable under "do no harm" medical ethics, the older you are the better your risk vs reward probabilities are.</p>
<p>But when we take a more detached view, young people are the obvious best candidates to fight aging in. Aging needn't be reverse in young people, only stalled.</p>
<p>Thus I had to do a bit of reading up on the subject. As I've been doing that, I realize I've come up with a plan plus some avenues for future investigation (i.e. self experimentation). This article is a distillation of the plan and the thought process that lead me to it, but I am leaving out a lot of details for the sake of brevity. The conclusion is a bit underwhelming, but I at least try to explore relevant areas, instead of wasting time on "longevity lifestyle" type topics.</p>
<h2>I A quick overview of the problem and target</h2>
<p>I will go ahead and assume that you are familiar with various theories around aging. For the purpose of this article, I am going to assume that the epigenetic theory of aging as propose by Guarente, Horvath, David Sinclaire, et al. For more information on this theory a good starting point is the Wikipedia article on the epigenetic clock [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_clock">1</a>], a good followup being a paper by Horvath himself [<a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115">2</a>] and a good reference to carry while reading is [<a href="https://dev.biologists.org/content/146/12/dev169854">3</a>].</p>
<p>The other theory I'm taking into account here is the mitochondrial theory of aging [<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.2174/1874609810801010010">4</a>], both in the form where it speculates that reactive oxygen could cause genetic &amp; structural damage to the cell and in the form where it speculates mitochondria genetic integrity degrades faster than that of the rest of human cells.</p>
<p>In short, aging is an interconnected process that goes something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cell DNA loses structural integrity with continued existence (e.g. when the DNA is read) and with each replication. Over dozens of years, this leads to many/most cells being dysfunctional from an epigenetic standpoint. I.e. not having the correct genes activate/deactivated/promoted in order to express the optimal quantities of proteins that allow them to fulfill their role.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cells suffer genetic and epigenetic damage due to external causes such as radiation damage, physical damage, chemical damage, infection with a virus/bacteria... etc</p>
</li>
<li><p>The mechanisms for repairing and staving off genetic and epigenetic damage seem to get worst as we age and they get worst in cells that have suffered more genetic and epigenetic damage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The mechanisms internal to the cell for destroying cells with too much genetic or epigenetic damage can malfunction due to... genetic and epigenetic damage =&gt; senescence or cancer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The mechanisms internal to the organism for destroying cells with too much genetic or epigenetic damage (e.g. the immune system) lose potency with age. Due to genetic and epigenetic damage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This damage accumulates, partially due to external factors and mostly due to the ways humans are "designed". The accumulation is "exponential", most types of damage cause positive feedback loops that make other types of damage easier.</p>
<p>It should be noted though, that when I say "damage" here I mean that from my selfish point of view, not from a natural selection point of view.</p>
<p>Tissue belonging to the immune system being replaced by adipose tissue is "damage" from an individual's point of view, but it's a "feature" working as intended from natural selection's perspective.</p>
<p>This is not a complete picture of the situation, not even from my layman's perspective, but I think it's a good practical synopsis we can start from.</p>
<p>When do we want to stop these aging mechanisms? If we could have a "static" snapshot of our body we are born anew into each day, how old should it be?</p>
<p>Looking at mortality per age demographic in the UK [<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1186/s12911-016-0342-z">5</a>], a rough answer is somewhere around 12, but anything up to 20 and maybe even 30 should do just fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305886430/figure/fig1/AS:391806765289478@1470425420511/Annual-risk-of-death-from-all-causes-for-England-and-Wales-2010-2012-known-as-the.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>How do we go about doing this?</p>
<h2>II Figuring out the actionable issues</h2>
<p>It's very simple to point at the "cellular" level causes as "genetic and epigenetic damage", but figuring out the mechanisms that can stop this doesn't seem like a solved problem</p>
<p>We can say things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>mTOR inhibition (which inhibits cell division, among other things [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC303352/">6</a>]) seems to increase the lifespan.</li>
<li>Increased sirtuin expression and NAD+ level seems to sometimes help stave off some of the genetic &amp; epigenetic damage.</li>
<li>Telomere length is a decent essay but doesn't hold much water as an actionable-upon target.</li>
<li>Proteins that allow for epigenetic de-aging exist and seem to work in vitro.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's no complete picture one can plug some numbers into to get an intervention plan</p>
<p>Epigenetic aging (and thus it's reversal) can be traced down to the expression of certain genes, e.g. the Yamanaka factors [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell">7</a>], which are used to create pluripotent stem cells from "normal" cell (i.e. reverse the epigenetic "age" of a cell [<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/acel.12877">8</a>,<a href="https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13072-018-0244-7">9</a>]). An easier to understand view on the topic, though one which to me seems to make some mistakes in the way it simplifies, is the book Lifespan: Why We Age―and Why We Don't Have To [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifespan:_Why_We_Age_%E2%80%93_and_Why_We_Don%27t_Have_To">10</a>].</p>
<p>Even more so, reversing the epigenetic age of cells is likely a process that will inadvertently promote the creation of new pluripotent stem cells, depending on the intervention, so it can also serve to help "replace" cells which are to badly damaged with "young" ones. [citation needed]</p>
<p>Genetic damage, assuming it sticks, is permanent. However, most genetic damage is either disadvantageous (=&gt; cell line dies out) or fatal (=&gt; same thing, but faster) and when it isn't, it's usually harmless. In situations where all 3 aren't true, we have something that might turn cancerous or otherwise dangerous, which is why we have the immune system.</p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of which, let's turn to an overview of the "macro" causes/symptoms of aging.</p>
<p>The first thing that concerns me is brain function and associate motor skills. But Warner Schaie [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474018/">11</a>] says I have basically nothing to worry about just yet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474018/bin/nihms10097f3.jpg" alt="enter image description here">
Same goes with motor control [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838968/">12</a>], it seems that up until my 30s I can pretty much ignore both as long as I apply the "use it or lose it rule", which is part of a life well-lived anyway, so it's not that relevant.</p>
<p>As for the rest of my body, most of it is either rather sturdy or somewhat redundant. For example, joint issues seem rather painful, but fixating on preventing them would just have me circle back to the cellular causes.</p>
<p>The things which seem to stand out most as having potential for being viewed as "causal" are the endocrine and lymphatic systems. I think there could be some interesting solutions that pertain to the endocrine system directly, but besides HRT (designed for old people) I haven't been able to find any. So my focus will remain on the lymphatic system, specifically the thymus.</p>
<p>It's actually a bit hard to find a definitive analysis on the topic, but, basically, all the primary literature will suggest the same thing: The thymus and various markers we associate with its function shrink with age starting somewhere in our teen years if not before [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1538100/pdf/clinexpimmunol00264-0060.pdf">13</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2249.2001.01640.x">14</a>]. This shrinking isn't necessarily the case for newborns (e.g. see [<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841859909174401?needAccess=true">15</a>]) and the thymus can regrow to some extent.</p>
<p>This is obviously a very bad thing and seems to be strongly correlated with everything from infectious disease to cancer in all tissue types [<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1883">16</a>]. Going back to our causes of aging, the reasons for this become obvious.</p>
<p>Which is not to say we'd want to have the thymus of a 2-year-old at 20, there's a reason the thymus shrinks. The more pathogens we get exposed to and the more our immune system gets accustomed to various proteins our own mutated cells might be predisposed to accumulate (citation needed), the less need of new immune memory cells we have.</p>
<p>Immune cells are expensive to maintain and known to sometimes accidentally damage or horribly and swiftly murder their host [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm">17</a>]. If you've ever taken an antiinflammatory drug, that's a sign you might at least in part agree with this sentiment.</p>
<p>Regardless, it seems practical to err on the side of "more" for anyone beyond their teen years.</p>
<p>So, as it stands, my position is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am constantly suffering genetic and epigenetic damage, both in my cells and my mitochondria. This damage will get exponentially worst as I age since it comes with positive feedback loops attached</li>
<li>The one organ/system that is most essential at combating this damage, as well as combating external threats to my body, is constantly shrinking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>III The standard nonsense</h2>
<p>Here is where I see most longevity intervention articles fail, in failing to focus on any real solutions because they are risky and uncertain. But focusing on lifestyle advice is pointless because it's a solved problem. Most people don't implement the solutions, but that's mainly a question of willpower. It's ultimately something that the individual must shape for themselves in a way that works for them.</p>
<p>The short-review of this section, if I must give one, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't eat anything with added fructose, glucose, sucrose or dextrose or anything breed to contain large quantities of those.</li>
<li>Don't eat anything with traces of hydrogenated fats, processed meat added fiber.</li>
<li>Keep in mind you can react badly to certain carbohydrate-binding plant proteins, figure out if and what they are.</li>
<li>There's an argument to be made that excessive consumption of omega 6 is bad, and either way you wouldn't want to see where that added soy/sunflower/rapeseed oil in the can came from, so maybe just avoid those unless you really like them.</li>
<li>Take a bunch of supplements depending on what you think your diet and environment might be missing, measure their effect (via daily blood draws looking at specific markers, not via placebo-ing yourself). Personally, I do a very small dose of D3, 100mcg MK7, 100mg …</li></ul></div></div>

Scene from The Joy of Painting.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Bob Ross, Inc.)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>When a shipment of paintings from Bob Ross, Inc. arrived at the <a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/bob-ross-exhibition">Penticton Art Gallery</a>, Paul Crawford realized he was looking at mountains and meadows and "happy little trees" that few, if any, had seen in decades.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It was crazy opening them up," says Crawford, the curator at the PAG. "I don't think they'd seen the light of day since they were put in the boxes. They still smelled of turpentine."</p>  <p>To September 13, Penticton&nbsp;— a city of 33,000 in the Okanagan Valley&nbsp;—&nbsp;will be one of the only places in the world where you can find an authentic Bob Ross. And the solo exhibition, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, is the largest of its kind to happen anywhere to date. Still, with more than 30 Bob Ross originals on view, the selection is nothing — a mere drop in the babbling brook — when you consider the volume Ross produced on <em>The Joy of Painting</em> alone.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'Let's get crazy'</h2>  <p>Between 1983-94, the series taped 403 episodes out of a local PBS station in Muncie, Ind. And beyond the occasional guest appearance — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QWvzEQ69Kw">Bob's son Steve</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpNrn0_97LM">Peapod the Squirrel</a> — the program's lulling, low-budget formula never really wavered.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In half an hour, Ross would conjure an original painting, pictures he actually created in triplicate for each episode. One painting was a reference image;&nbsp;another was for publication (instructional books were a pillar of the original Bob Ross empire, a business that was reportedly worth <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all">$15 million US</a> by 1991). And the third piece materialized as the cameras rolled.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It's those canvases — familiar landscapes of nowhere in particular — that countless viewers have admired from home. But beyond the screen, these original works have rarely, if ever, been on view. Though Ross was known to occasionally donate his work to PBS stations, he didn't sell the paintings made on the program, and Bob Ross, Inc. — the company that manages his intellectual property — has never been in the business of dealing art. Originals are not for sale through BRI. Instead, you can buy Bob Ross jigsaw puzzles, novelty socks, even Fun Dip-style powdered candy (the Bob Ross "<a href="https://experience.bobross.com/2019/11/14/bob-ross-candy-flavor-palette/">Flavor Palette</a>"). On rare occasions, <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/entertainment/art/4684705-Minnesota-couple-learns-painting-bought-40-years-ago-is-Bob-Ross-original">an authentic landscape</a> will appear on the market.

A&nbsp;collection can be found in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., home to the <a href="https://www.bobrossartworkshop.com/">Bob Ross Art Workshop and Gallery</a> since 1992. But the motherlode's stored at BRI headquarters. Last year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/arts/bob-ross-paintings-mystery.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> journeyed to their office in Herndon, Va., and made a charming, bite-sized documentary that solved the mystery of the missing landscapes. (Some 1,165 Bob Ross originals are stashed away in their building.)</p>  <p>Crawford saw that doc last summer. And then he sent BRI an email. He wanted those paintings in Penticton.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Making <em>Happy Little Accidents</em></h2>  <p>"I was really wanting to celebrate the legacy of Bob Ross, and really look at some of the larger questions that Bob presented himself: whose work deserves to be in a museum, and whose work needs to be remembered?" says Crawford.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A few years back, an exhibition devoted to the landscapes of <a href="https://mackenzie.art/experience/exhibition/a-sublime-vernacular-the-landscape-paintings-of-levine-flexhaug/">Levine Flexhaug</a>&nbsp;— Saskatchewan's master of the thrift-store sublime&nbsp;—&nbsp;appeared at galleries around the country. (A companion exhibition about Canadian "<a href="http://pentictonartgallery.com/speed">speed painters</a>," Flexhaug included, is open at the PAG to Sept. 13.) Crawford says he's taken a note from that travelling Flexhaug show in curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, and if there's a strict definition of "museum-worthy," the show aims to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy6J4e1z4Lc">beat the devil out of it</a>," like some old dirty paintbrush.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ross died of lymphoma in 1995, but if a museum retrospective eluded him in his time, he wasn't especially fussed about it. In 1991, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> asked Ross about the subject. Already a low-key icon, he said he wasn't keen on the notion. "Most painters want recognition, especially by their peers. I achieved that a long time ago with TV. I don't need any more." And according to BRI, major arts institutions weren't exactly clamouring to get their white gloves on a Bob Ross painting — at least until last year.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659999.1595507752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-mountain-summit-1987.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross.

Later that year, the <a href="https://www.franklinparkartscenter.org/exhibitions/bob-ross/">Franklin Park Arts Centre</a> (Purcellville, Va.) opened <em>Happy Accidents</em>, a show devoted to Ross's TV paintings. When the PAG came calling, BRI says they were fielding similar requests from galleries around the world. Three paintings are now on view at <a href="https://arkdes.se/en/utstallning/asmr-weird-sensation-feels-good/">ArkDes</a> in Sweden (they're part of a salute to ASMR, the oddly satisfying genre of which Ross is hailed as the permed patron saint). Another solo exhibition is scheduled to open at the <a href="https://www.museummore.nl/en/">Museum MORE</a> in the Netherlands this November. And a <a href="https://minnetrista.net/home/things-to-do/exhibits/bob-ross-experience/">brand new attraction</a>, a shrine to the man himself, will open this October in Muncie, Ind., long-time home of <em>The Joy of Painting</em>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Writes Sarah Strohl, an executive assistant at BRI: "With the recent resurgence of interest and love for Bob Ross in the past few years, we have displayed paintings in exhibits as well as donated four paintings to the Smithsonian." (Oh, yeah — that happened in 2019, too. In addition to the artwork, Smithsonian National Museum of American History&nbsp;acquired an old easel from the show and some production notebooks.) "However," says Strohl, "our focus has always been the same as Bob's on the show:&nbsp;to interest others in creating paintings of their own."</p>  <p>On the surface, yes,<em> The Joy of Painting</em>&nbsp;is designed so folks can dabble along from home. But it's a rare fan who's squeezed out a tube of Prussian Blue. Ross knew it. As he told the <em><a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1990-07-07-9007060122-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a> </em>in 1990: "The majority of our audience does not paint, has no desire to paint, will never paint." Instead, the show's appeal is more abstract. It's less about the art lesson, and more about the mood: cozy, nurturing — an audio-visual pat on the back, coaxing the audience to try something new. For 22 minutes, at least, there's no fear of failure. As Ross used to say, "We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="" sizes="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660007.1595508155!/fileImage/httpImage/bob-ross-happy-accidents.gif"></p></div><figcaption> <!-- -->(Giphy)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But a Bob Ross fan doesn't necessarily get the same huggy vibes when they think about contemporary art. In curating <em>Happy Little Accidents</em>, Crawford says he was thinking about Ross's gift for reaching the masses. "So many people feel they don't have the knowledge that they can engage in art, and that, to me, is appalling. We need to change that."</p>  <p>Even in a pandemic, <em>Happy Little Accidents</em> has likely attracted some first-time patrons to the PAG already. The gallery is keeping extended hours to match demand, and is open seven days a week through the summer. According to Crawford, people have been lining up every morning since the show opened July 4. (Because of COVID-19, only 13 guests are allowed in the exhibition at a time.) Additional programming includes painting classes with a "Bob Ross-Certified" teacher. The first round sold out, and more have been added.&nbsp;(There are <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/bob-ross-instructors_n_56465ea4e4b0603773491281?ri18n=true&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAALON9mL8cT4UC27WdyOWykz8B3iZD94swx7lOm_2zN8aaDgGTklIkFGkyUq5GdWqW8ySYOua-68Wre2bQoYSgvuk0UsZ8yPi13cGZZGZZd6WGas1i9B2WMxtwnuorJ9x9fc42RCRIQrCCesQe5d9roE3ideznBF3IhlaETlpVsb">thousands of these official instructors around the world</a>, it turns out. Says Crawford: "There must be a dozen that are living within a three-hour drive of us here in Penticton.")&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/happy-little-accidents.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/happy-little-accidents.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/happy-little-accidents.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/happy-little-accidents.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5660001.1595507860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/happy-little-accidents.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Installation view of Happy Little Accidents at the Penticton Art Gallery.

("It's a very solemn painting with a sort of dead tree that sort of sits in a very ethereal sort of landscape," says Crawford.) In person, he says the landscapes are more impressive than he'd imagined. "There's a luminosity to them, you know, for as beguilingly simple as they are."</p>  <p>And in researching the exhibition, Crawford says he came across a surprising B.C. connection&nbsp;—&nbsp;one that's only touched on at the museum. Before Ross made his TV debut, he studied with William Alexander, another guy known for painting landscapes on PBS. A former German POW, Alexander moved to North America after the Second World War, and lived all over Canada during his lifetime, including Powell River, B.C. His Emmy-winning series, though, <em>The Magic of Oil Painting</em>, taped at a Los Angeles public-broadcasting station from 1974-82, and it shares plenty of aesthetic DNA with Ross's format, right down to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmWbC2I_Qg">all-black set</a>. "It's remarkable how similar they are," says Crawford. "But he was a rough, gruff-spoken fellow and didn't quite have Bob's smooth way of delivery." Alexander wasn't cool with Ross's fame, though. (As he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/arts/television-bob-ross-the-frugal-gourmet-of-painting.html?pagewanted=all"><em>New York Times</em></a> in 1991: "I trained him and he is copying me.") Despite the bad blood, his influence is briefly mentioned in the PAG show.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659997.1595507676!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/bob-ross-surf-s-up.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Bob Ross.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

July 24, 2020 | https://dashbird.io/blog/5-popular-use-cases-for-going-serverless/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dashbird.io/blog/5-popular-use-cases-for-going-serverless/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Since 2014 when AWS launched <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and kickstarted the serverless movement, going serverless has grown exponentially for organizations of all sizes from one-man start-ups to huge listed global enterprises. While there are <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/challenges-of-going-serverless-2020/">some challenges to this new architecture</a>, the ways moving to serverless can <a href="https://sls.dashbird.io/going-serverless-case-study">transform a business</a> often far outweigh these.</p>
<p>Before looking at the use cases for serverless, let’s start from the basics and define what it actually means. While obvious, it’s important to clarify that there are still servers and data centers involved, however, they are now managed for you. Cloud providers, like AWS, offer managed off-the-shelf services on their own servers, both of which they are responsible for in terms of security, provisioning, updates and everything else you were previously responsible for on-prem servers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, a good way to think of serverless is “pay-per-use computing”, i.e. when you’re not using it, there are no costs. It’s then down to you - the user - to be responsible for the code, what you put into the managed services, and how you use them. It is also your code that stitches the chosen managed services together to create your unique application; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Below are a few of the best use cases for going serverless. This is by no means an exhaustive list as the opportunities and solutions really can be endless, however, the examples below offer some of the most popular and most common reasons serverless architecture is being adopted. You might also want to check out our <a href="https://sls.dashbird.io/going-serverless-case-study">case study on going serverless</a> based on Shamrock Trading Corp example.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases:</h2>
<h2 id="building-restful-apis">Building Restful APIs&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One of the most popular use cases for going serverless is the ease at which to build RESTful APIs. Within AWS, Lambda functions alongside <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/api-gateway/what-is-an-api-gateway/">API Gateway</a> provide a seamless way in which to create a scalable endpoint that processes data in real-time. Its ability to scale and fluctuate as demand changes without the need to maintain the servers it sits on is, understandably, a developer’s dream come true.</p>
<p>Being able to configure service integrations with API Gateway, AWS has made it simpler to implement asynchronous processing and, helpfully, reduces the need for additional Lambda functions.</p>
<h2 id="websockets">Websockets</h2>
<p>We are in an age where real-time two-way communication, such as live chat functionality, is not only more common but increasingly expected by customers and users. Websockets are perfect to enable this capability or in fact any time you’re needing communication of data between the user’s interface and a server.</p>
<p>Again, looking at AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda, connections between the user and server can be created and maintained with only a Lambda function being triggered when the user sends a message. This avoids the need to continuously poll the server for a reply reducing uptime.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-compute">Parallel Compute</h2>
<p>Using AWS Lambda, one of the mainstays within serverless, users are able to implement parallel computing. AWS Lambda uses a single concurrency model which essentially translates as one Lambda function handling only one request at any one time. This <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/scalability-and-concurrency/">coupled with its scalability</a> means that should thousands of requests come in at the same time, the equivalent of Lambda functions will be automatically spun up.</p>
<p>This ability to break down large requests into concise and independent ones means each request can be executed simultaneously and therefore more quickly. Lambda charges are based on duration and so even at the highest memory, if those thousands of requests only take a few minutes to run and execute, the costs will be incredibly small each time.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-processing">Asynchronous Processing&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier in this article, going serverless encourages <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/message-queue/">asynchronous processing</a>. To sum up, asynchronous processing distributes the processing required between systems in an intercommunication environment. In real terms for an application, it enables the behind the scenes tasks to remain in a well-connected and considered background, which has a wealth of benefits.</p>
<p>For example, the end-user is not affected by the requests running in the background and can still interact with the application. This means that a critically enjoyable user experience is maintained while your business reputation stays high. Other great benefits of this method is a reduced idle or waiting time and greater concurrency between components, which ultimately saves time and reduces costs.</p>
<h2 id="development-velocity--more-value">Development Velocity &amp; More Value</h2>
<p>While scalability and reduced costs are substantial reasons to go serverless (as we mentioned a few times already), ultimately the biggest argument for going serverless is development velocity. Development velocity is the speed and use of the full potential at which you can deliver additional value units, either through providing existing value to new customers or new value (e.g. new features) to existing customers.</p>
<p>Going serverless provides developers with a better environment to innovate by removing some of the crucial but non-value-adding tasks, such as server maintenance and provisioning. This responsibility shift naturally realigns a developer’s focus to continue to add greater business performance and as a result, increased revenue. According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance#">McKinsey research</a>, top-in-class developer tools that enable greater productivity, visibility, and coordination are the main contributors to business success.</p>
<p>For all organizations, development velocity needs to be considered as a long game. While some gains can be made in a short space of time, the greatest wins will come from considered development.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Going serverless can seem confusing and at times a little over-hyped, particularly if the way your business and its infrastructure currently works for you. This said, given the development velocity and business value serverless offers, shown through the few examples offered above, dipping a toe into the serverless water to trial could be well worth it and open up opportunities not otherwise considered. The key is to start off small and considered, and set realistic expectations on the results and on the workload to get it started.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of ways to introduce some of the benefits into your organization without going all in, straight away with serverless. Hybrid cloud options are becoming more common and in fact, making more sense for increasing numbers of organizations due to their flexibility and getting the best out of everything out there. Find the best use case that applies to your application and give it a go.

        <div>
            <p><a href="https://riggraz.dev/">..</a></p>
<p>A couple of days ago I was surfing GitHub when I stumbled across something that caught my interest. A little notification box was telling me that I earned a badge for being an “Arctic Code Vault Contributor”.</p>

<p>I had no idea what it was, so I googled it and found out about the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">GitHub Archive Program</a>. Basically, it is GitHub’s plan to preserve open source software for a long long time. The Arctic Code Vault is just a part of the Archive Program, specifically aimed at storing data for 1000 years from now in a decommissioned coal mine near the North Pole.</p>

<p>GitHub first put the most important open source software there, then, on 2 February 2020, added to the storage every active<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Some of my repositories are there.</p>

<p>I get a strange feeling when I think that something mine is stored 250 meters deep in the permafrost and is supposed to stay there for at least 1000 years. That <em>my name</em> will be there for at least 1000 years.</p>

<p>To date, this will be by far the most long-lasting memory of me. I hardly believe anything else about me will survive that long. A bunch of (bad?) lines of code will be the only things left to define me.</p>

<hr>

<p>I want to draw a parallel with a historical tradition. Emperors used to build commemorative statues to show their power and to be remembered after their death. I am not a historian, however I suppose that a lot of these statues have either gone lost or destroyed or damaged. Probably some emperors are unknown today because everything about them got lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our code will survive for at least 10 centuries, probably much more. Powerful emperors’ memories have been more ephemeral.</p>

<p>However, they were far more suggestive, evocative, strong. Compare the evocative power of a mighty celebrative statue that portrays the ideal representation of somebody with a dry, emotionless collection of bits.</p>

<p>We might feel like the most enduring memory of us will be pretty boring and inaccurate at describing who we were. We might have hoped for leaving behind something else, something more meaningful. But is it really so?</p>

<hr>

<p>You can think of the Arctic Code Vault as a giant, secure, resistant museum, and something yours is stored inside it. It is thrilling to think that in the distant future somebody may enter this museum and take a look at some of your work.</p>

<p>Your name will be remembered alongside artifacts you produced.</p>

<p>Sure, code may not be the best medium to portray one’s memory, however I think it can say at least something about the author’s personality. For instance, a clean piece of code reveals a certain attitude in its author, whereas a messy piece of code another one. The simple fact that you are a programmer tells something about you.</p>

<p>Moreover, as opposed to a celebrative statue, your code is far more authentic: you probably wrote it for some inner reason, not as a way to be remembered. In particular, the fact that you built that exact thing says a lot about <em>you</em>, it <em>defines</em> you<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Maybe it is not an inadequate way to be remembered, after all.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BadChinaTake">@BadChinaTake</a> is actually just a vehicle for ethnographic research needed to complete my second PhD. Yes, you did sign the Institutional Review Board waiver.</p>



<p>The following four broad categories are useful for anyone who wishes to navigate the cesspit of public opinion on the English-speaking Internet. While there are of course interdisciplinary individuals whose takes transcend categories, if not the very bounds of reason and logic, nevertheless, the following is sufficient as a primer to acquaint oneself with the varieties of garbage available to any aspiring to become a fabled China Watcher.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please keep them to yourself! I am very, very busy knowing things about China!</p>



<p><strong>Mystic China Knowers (MCKs)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: More or less any cultural consultant, Martin Jacques (who is also a tankie, detailed below, and does not even speak Chinese</em>)<em>, and really most people besides actual specialists in Eastern philosophy who insert quotes from Confucius</em> <em>into their writing</em></p>



<p>Most MCKs are not ethnically Chinese, BUT, they often have been to China and/or other places in the exciting <em>Sinosphere</em>, maybe for even up to a few years or more, and speak some Mandarin! Most often, though, theirs is of the mellifluous “<em>waw hway shwah zhawng-win</em>” variety, which they are entirely unaware of because the bar for non-native/heritage speakers (especially white ones) who learn Chinese is not low, it is just fully on the ground. MCKs are big fans of <strong>“phrenology for words,”</strong> an obnoxious genre of take based on an extremely superficial reading of some random Mandarin phrase, which they think they can divine like tea leaves with their HSK 3 level skills of cross-culture communication. For instance, from a consultant in India:</p>

<p><em>The notion of “goodbye” was indeed unheard of until brought to the subcontinent by the East India Trading Company and later to Qing China by the Royal Navy during the First Opium War</em>.<em> Everyone was just always, like, together before that</em>.</p>



<hr>



<p>From the relatively few MCKs whose attention spans and Mandarin reading ability  allow them progress from singular words or phrases into the realm of entire books, we get the “<strong>I once read this Chinese thing</strong>” subtype. Their genesis begins with the subject’s consumption of one, or maybe even a few, venerable Chinese texts. These texts might be a classic (probably read in translation, which is normally fine, unless you’re constructing a Unified Theory of China on it, in which case you need to suck it up and learn Classical Chinese). It might also be something like, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-05/is-the-u-s-in-a-new-cold-war-china-has-already-declared-it">I dunno, the Three Body Problem</a>, because that was on sale at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>



<p>Whatever the text, upon consumption it renders unto the MCK a bounteous insight regarding literally anything you can think of about China and the Chinese; usually, this is also whatever topic is easiest to get placed in an op-ed or decent blog. Through feats of exegesis and interpretation that would put St. Augustine or Maimonides to shame, the MCK extracts meaning that, coincidentally, will also be critical for you to know if you want even the slightest chance of your line of spandex infant lederhosen to take off in Peking this fall. Their fee is $4,998.00 per briefing.</p>



<p>While rarer in the Twitterverse, there are certainly Chinese people whose views fall under the MCK category. One might argue that the Communist Party of China’s continued harping emphasizing 5,000 years of Chinese history puts it in this territory on occasion as well. (Archaeologist Michael Storozum has a good piece on why that claim relies on some pretty… liberal interpretations of what exactly constitutes a reliable historical record <a href="https://radiichina.com/china-5000-years-history/">here in Radii</a>.)</p>



<p><strong>Death 2 CCP Squad (D2CS)</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Rob Spalding, Chris Balding, Steve Bannon &amp; Miles Kwok, presumably all members of Committee on the Present Danger: China, management and most reporters of the Epoch Times</em></p>



<p>D2CS is to China as Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz are to Iraq. They are <strong>the inverse of a Tankie</strong>, in way; China cannot do anything that is not a pernicious threat to the civilized world, freedom, love, beauty, and truth. The D2CS cheapen legitimate, pressing concerns about China on security, economic, and human rights fronts by instantly transforming any discussion thereof into a Manichaean battle of the Utterly Good United States et al. versus the People’s Republic of Evil and its ilk. Particularly noxious because of the influence many of them have in the US government at present (or <em>had,</em> before getting kicked out, in the cases of Spalding and Bannon.)</p>

<p>D2CS types are <strong>predominantly, but not exclusively, right-wing.</strong> Their backgrounds are diverse—some (like Miles Kwok a.k.a. Guo Wengui) were burned by Beijing and flipped their relatively mundane anger at losing everything they had in some power struggle into a self-righteous crusade; others (like Spalding) were spurned by some part of The Beltway establishment for being nincompoops and are convinced there is a conspiracy against all good patriots; and some are justifiably aggrieved Hong Kongers who have placed their hopes on the American right to deliver them, which, in all seriousness, really sucks to see. Then there’s the Epoch Times. Remember when their editorial board <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-unsolicited-paper-spreads-outlandish-covid-claims/103-9290495e-a501-44fa-b7df-0bb0e385328b">suggested</a> people afflicted with COVID-19 should consider denouncing Chinese Communist Ideology as a potential cure? Great crowd over there. Quality stuff.</p>



<p>The <strong>relatively small left-wing D2CS contingent</strong> seems to be primarily composed of Extremely Online pro-Taiwan independence advocates, the kind who make Tsai Ing-wen look like Chiang Ching-kuo. It’s not clear to me how many are even Taiwanese. Their wrath also stems from kernels of concern about the security and wellbeing of the place they genuinely have come to love, but frankly, it just gets cringey, and they seem to lack an understanding that their rhetoric is frequently appropriated by the right to advocate for hawkish policy that if anything may put <em>more </em>Taiwanese people in danger.</p>



<p><strong>Tankies</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: Employees of </em>Grayzone<em> (especially editor <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton">Norton)</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/qiaocollective">Qiao <s>Beehive</s> Collective</a>, and upwards of 90% of people with ☭ in their Twitter display name)</em></p>



<p>A classic type whose name is derived from the Soviet tanks that rolled through either Czechoslovakia in 1968, Hungary in 1956, or even the tanks at Tiananmen Square in 1989, depending on who you ask. The Tankie is an unapologetic Western apologist for authoritarian violence and repression regularly deployed by the CCP against dissidents and activists it deems a threat to Party rule. The tankie will probably tell you those dissident and activists were counterrevolutionaries anyway. Many appear to be literal teenagers, which is telling.</p>



<p>Through extremely ahistorical and elementary readings of a smorgasbord of left-wing texts, or at least the screenshots of said texts they see on Twitter, Tankies collate around an “<strong>Identity Politics for Stalinists,” </strong>a ludicrous worldview the functionally renders the very idea of imperial colonialism exclusively to the domain of white-majority countries (except the USSR, of course, which was not imperialist, and Hong Kong democracy protestors, who are, because one of the waved a Union Jack that one time) and by extension does not countenance the idea that China could ever engage in similar offenses. Interestingly, there are degrees of Tankie-ism, or in other words, there are some Tankies that are too Tankie even for other Tankies:</p>

Kim Jong-un is just misunderstood.  It’s all very charming.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Politically, they are much less powerful on the whole than the most prominent D2CS type, probably because they are too obnoxious to be around in real life, making organizing grassroots actions hard. Yet they are subtly pernicious in that their presence is extremely corrosive for the left writ large; if I’m a Ukrainian-American at my first New York DSA meeting, I’m going to get pretty pissed when someone gets up and tells me my <em>babusya’s</em> death was actually faked for CIA agitprop or whatever. Ditto re: any Hong Konger who might otherwise organize on the left (speaking of which, shout out to <a href="https://lausan.hk/">Lausan</a> , which everyone should read).</p>



<p>Indeed, the tell-tale sign of Tankie-ism is the belief that the CIA/other Western intelligence agencies are several orders of magnitude more effective, discreet, and competent than they actually are, which is probably pretty embarrassing for the CIA. Another tell-tale sign is just views of history that sound like they come from a weird fairytale:</p>

<p><strong>CCP Bootlickers</strong></p>



<p><em>Examples: <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlZha">Carl Zha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunrein">Shaun Rein</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Fowdy">Tom Fowdy</a>, that one fratbro you studied abroad in Shanghai with for a semester and who really hit it off with the nephew of the Deputy Chair of the District Party Committee when you all went out clubbing once and then decided he was never going back to Arkansas, ever</em>,<em> because this place is great</em></p>



<p>Unlike Tankies, the Bootlicker is not convincingly Marxist, although they may nominally claim to be for the sake of convenience. They prefer to expound upon the superiority of the People’s Republic in more platitudinous terms, like pictures of ethnic minorities dancing happily. They generally have direct experience living and working in China, or are from there themselves, which helps explain why they are not real Marxists, because if they were, they might get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_incident">steamrolled by the CCP</a>. In reality, the bootlickers just subscribe the what may be termed <strong>“Socialism with Suck-up Characteristics.”</strong></p>



<p>The Bootlicker can be driven by any combination of motives, such as financial interest in China, nationalism, and/or contrarianism. For Shaun Rein, for instance, it appears to be a combination of all three. There’s also the fact that his mother-in-law is the daughter Marshal Ye Jianying, who was a member of the CCP Politburo in the 1970s and 80s. </p>

Two-way Binding for Custom Components</a></h2><blockquote><p>Allows a custom component to customize the prop and event used when it’s used with v-model. By default, v-model on a component uses value as the prop and input as the event, but some input types such as checkboxes and radio buttons may want to use the value prop for a different purpose. Using the model option can avoid the conflict in such cases.</p></blockquote><p><code>v-model</code> is well-known for two-way binding. <code>input</code> is the default update event. The value can be updated via <code>$emit</code>. The only limitation is that the component needs an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag to bind with the <code>value</code> prop.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-checkbox</span> <span>v-model</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>val<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-checkbox</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

Different to <code>v-model</code>, it doesn't require your component to have an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag and bind the value to it. It only triggers <code>update:&lt;your_prop&gt;</code> to mutate the prop via event system.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>custom-component</span> <span>:value.sync</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>value<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="7-component-lifecycle-hook"><a href="#7-component-lifecycle-hook">7.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>There's another simple solution to this. You can use the <code>@hook:mounted</code> instead. It's used within the Vue internal system.</p><pre><code>

                    <blockquote>Note: this post is about defensive security that helps developers build secure applications as opposed to offensive security.</blockquote><p>Much ink has been spilt to describe and praise the recent DevOps (developer + operations) phenomenon. The development community rejoiced as we tore down the walls between dev and ops teams. We cried tears of joy and product-owners hifi'd each other as DevOps shortened the software development lifecycle and provided continuous delivery with high software quality.</p><p>However, in this brouhaha, we seem to have forgotten (or ignored) an element of Ops that is a crucial part of software development - Security. Many corporations (there are of-course exceptions) seem to have delegated security to a secondary status that is viewed more as a blocker than an enabler. There are good reasons for this:</p><ol><li>Developers are still not actively taught about secure coding practices when they learn a programming language or framework. It's akin to teaching them how to drive a car but not teach them how to put a seatbelt on or how to change lanes safely. It's something they are expected to learn on their own or by following their organisations "coding standards".</li><li>The security team/culture either doesn't want to evolve or is not empowered to change to match the cadence of the modern continuous delivery process. The classical approach - doing pen testing after the fact, or doing application security review days before go-live - doesn't scale and slows the team down. If a process introduces blocking, then it will be ignored, not embraced.</li><li>Security is still thought of as an after-the-fact task. It is not as crucial as shipping a functional product. This attitude also applies to security testing. Many startups don't have dedicated security engineer(s) on their team until they have x number of members in the organisation, or y number of customers or z millions in revenue.</li><li>Over-reliance on a particular framework to do the work for you. Many teams believe that if use a framework that promises baked-in security, then they're covered and don't have to worry about application security. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a secure language or app framework.</li><li>Doing security right is hard. Primarily in teams where devs push code to production 100 times a day - how do you ensure what's being pushed is secure and follows best practice without being a blocker? It's like trying to build a parachute after you've jumped and before you hit the ground.</li></ol><p>Given these challenges, is it even possible to create a culture where security is an enabler and not a blocker? The short answer is yes, but it requires a massive shift in attitude and incentives linked to delivery (see the long answer below).</p><p>The solution lies in extending the principles of DevOps (i.e. remove silos and organisational blockers, focus on good communication and collaboration) by incorporating security since it faces the same challenges as Ops.</p><p>An oft-repeated cliche in the security industry states - <strong><em>Security is everyone's responsibility</em></strong>. It's like saying <strong><em>He who controls the spice, controls the universe.</em></strong> It's evident and meaningless. Unless you make cultural and fundamental process changes and provide the right kind of incentives to promote security, it will NOT be everybody's responsibility.</p><p>I don't claim to have all the answers, but here are a few things I've learned that will help you set up a DevSecOps process that might help:</p><h3 id="start-with-culture">Start with culture</h3><p>Security is as much a people problem as it's a technology problem. Historically, we didn't discuss the need for positive security culture. The approach to security was more technical and less human - we tried and failed to solve the security problem by building or buying tools to detect, fix and deter security issues.</p><ul><li>Hire a dedicated security team. Pro-tip: make sure the team is diverse. Depending on your requirements and budget, you can have engineers, pen-testers, security architects.</li><li>Embed designated security engineers and architects in your product/project team squads. This approach is a simple extension of embedding Ops engineers as part of the team. The security engineer is involved in sprint planning, design session, code reviews (where possible), building personal relationships, educating the peers on security best practice, and creating graphs/stats to track security metrics. By making security part of the development lifecycle, you</li><li>The security engineer should act as an enabler (they should be incentivised based on this criteria), and help build tools or use off the shelf tools that will allow them to keep up with the development cadence.</li><li>Remove the barrier to interact with the OpSec team - make them accessible and visible a.k.a don't put them in the basement.</li></ul><h3 id="be-data-driven">Be Data-Driven</h3><p>Collect data and metrics to understand the ROI of your security investment.</p><ul><li>Number of tickets/user-stories that impact access control, handling sensitive data</li><li>The number of defects related to security. Use these to compare which feature set of the platform has more issues and do a root cause analysis to understand if there is a fundamental problem with the development methodology for the application framework, e.g. android app has more bugs than the iOS app</li><li>Bug bounties (from external users or security researchers)</li><li>The number of known breaches per day/week/quarter. It will make the need to have a more secure approach explicit</li><li>Real-time monitoring of attacks (e.g. DDoS)</li><li>Evolve the rules and process as the company, and the product evolves. Ensure that your best practice reflects the latest and the best approach to securing applications</li></ul><p>The data serves two purposes -</p><ol><li>Helps you to learn from your mistakes and therefore evolve your security posture</li><li>Makes security incidents explicit so that everybody can see why we need to be proactive about security</li></ol><h3 id="management-exec-support">Management / Exec Support</h3><p>The culture change to be more security-minded needs to be driven top-down. Hire a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) if you can. Don't (under any circumstances) give the CISO responsibilities to someone who is also responsible for technical delivery to avoid conflict of interests. Keep the two roles separate and incentivise the CISO to be an enabler for the tech/delivery team.</p><p><strong>Blameless postmortem:</strong> When a security incident does happen, ensure that the postmortem is blameless. These postmortems aim to identify and understand the root cause, instead of trying to find a scapegoat. The learnings from the postmortems must flow back to the implementation team to prevent similar issues in the future.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The security industry still has a long way to go to be seen as a crucial part of the development lifecycle. There is reason to be optimistic, however. The DevOps approach is gaining traction, and it will be the default mode of building products and applications soon. It paves the way for treating security the same as Ops, and inserting it as part of the delivery will be easier. The suggestions in this post are one way of doing this, more effective and nuanced approaches will evolve, and it will benefit everybody - developers, end-users, and the organisation's bottom line.</p>

One such specialty is calculating the 8-digit root of a 13th power of 100 digits. Achieving record times historically required massive memorization and calculating speed, racing through a procedure that remains a mystery to most people. Part I of this essay provides a historical overview of the extraction of 13th roots, including the methods used by a few mental calculators, methods that largely rely on a mix of intensive mental calculation and large-scale rote memorization. It demonstrates the creativity and drive of these&nbsp; marvelous people.</p>
<p>In Part II of this essay we will propose a new method for 13th roots like those posed to lightning calculators that is relatively easy to learn, one that makes this feat feasible for those of us with basic mental math capabilities and a desire to do something amazing. A printer-friendly PDF version of Parts I and II is linked at the end of this essay.</p>

<p><strong>Why 13th Roots?</strong></p>
<p>It is generally known that the difficulty of mentally solving for integer roots depends on the number of digits in the root rather than the number of digits in the power. So why did the 13th root of a 100-digit number become the standard?</p>
<p>First, the appeal of a prime power must be acknowledged. Square root extraction is another popular category in itself. Composite roots such as the 4th root or 12th root can be calculated as a sequence of roots of their factors (two square roots to get a 4th root, followed by a cube root to get a 12th root). In fact, for a given number of digits in the root, even-numbered roots are more difficult because the final digit of an odd root can be found from the final digit of the power. It turns out that orders of powers that are one more than a multiple of 4 (such as the 13th power) have a root with the same final digit, while orders of powers that are one less than a multiple of 4 (such as a cube) have a root with a unique final digit relative to the final digit of the power. So here we have the first clue: the final digit of a 13th root will be the same as that of the power.</p>
<p>Second, 100 is an impressive round number of digits, and this produces a 13th root consisting of 8 digits. This number of digits proves to be non-trivial while not beyond the capabilities of the best mental calculators. If there were only 3 digits in the root of an odd power, the problem is easy. The final digit is found from the rules just described. The first digit can be inferred from memorized or estimated ranges of the powers. The properties of modular arithmetic can reveal the middle digit; here the root and power are replaced with remainders after division by an integer while still retaining the 13th power relationship, and we can deduce the missing digit.</p>
<p>For example, consider the 3-digit root of an odd power such as 24137569. Since 200<sup>3</sup> = 8000000 and 300<sup>3</sup>=27000000, we know the root has a 2 as the first digit. Since 3 is one less than a multiple of 4, the final digit of the root will not necessarily equal that of the power, but there will be a unique mapping—in this case 9<sup>3</sup> ends in 9 so the last digit is in fact 9 and we are left with 2b9, where b is unknown. The remainder when a number N is divided by 11 (or N mod 11) can be found by subtracting the odd-place digits from the even place digits and repeating, adding 11’s until the result lies between 0 and 10. Here 24137569 mod 11 = (9+5+3+4) – (6+7+1+2) = 5. Now (2b9)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 must equal 5 as well. So [(9+2) – b]<sup>3</sup> mod 11 =&nbsp; (11 – b)<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5. As noted above, for cube roots there is a unique mapping between n and n<sup>3</sup> mod 11 and this mapping would be memorized by the mental calculator. Here we can see that 3<sup>3</sup> mod 11 = 5 since 27 = 22+5, so 11–b = 3 or b = 8. So the cube root of 24137569 is 289.</p>
<p>For the 13th root of a 100-digit number, the first digit is always 4, and we know the last digit is the same as the power. But the 13th root has 8 digits and 7992563 possibilities so there is much more ambiguity, even when the performer has memorized long tables of 2-digit or 3-digit sets of beginning and ending digits. For this reason, the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> created the category of 13th root extraction of 100-digit numbers, recording in the eleventh edition of 1972 a time of 23 minutes by Herbert B. de Grote of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Methods</strong></p>
<p>In the years since de Grote’s initial record, great efforts have been taken to solve 13th roots, and as a result the times required for it have steadily decreased. Here we will discuss three of the major players in this field: Wim Klein, Gert Mittring and Alexis Lemaire.</p>

He eventually attained a record time in 1981 of 1 minute 28 seconds to calculate the 13th root of</p>
<p>88008443440489299575219015772236417859411720052615<br>
65487280650870412023307854274990144578442271602817</p>
<p>He found the answer to be 48757377.</p>
<p>How did he calculate these roots? Klein used logarithms to find the first five digits, and then used his knowledge of 13th root endings and modular arithmetic to deduce the last three digits. To find the logarithms he would factor the initial digits and add up those 5-digit logarithms from memory, interpolating between values as needed for offsets. Then he would divide by 13 and use the reverse process to find the antilogarithm, the number whose logarithm would be that value. This would be the initial five digits of the root. It is far easier said than done.</p>
<p>Smith [1983] discussed with Klein his method for finding the 13th root of</p>
<p>14762420839370760705665953772022217870318956930659<br>
27236796230563061507768203333609354957218480390144</p>
<p>Here is Smith’s account of Klein’s procedure:</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the root are fixed through the use of logarithms. Klein has memorized to five places the logs of the integers up to 150; this, coupled with his ability to factor large numbers, allows him to approximate the log of the first five digits of the power, which is usually sufficient to determine the first five digits of the root, though, as he says “the fifth digit is a bit chancy.”</p>
<p>Klein began by factoring 1,476 into 36 times 41 and taking the (decimal) log of each: log 36 = 1.55630 and log 41 = 1.61278; adding the mantissas yields 0.16908, but this is, of course, too little. Through various interpolations Klein estimated the mantissa of the log of 147,624 as 0.16925 (it is more nearly 0.16916).</p>
<p>Klein now had an approximation of the log of the 100-digit number above – 99.16925. This must be divided by 13 to obtain the log of the 13th root. Since 99=13 × 7 with a remainder of 8, to obtain the mantissa of the antilog of the 13th root he divided 8.16925 by 13, which is approximately 0.62840. He estimated the antilog to be about halfway between 4.2 and 4.3 and decided to try 4.25. The result was exact, so the first five digits of the root should be 42500, as indeed they are.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to determine the last three digits of the root. This he does from an examination of the last three digits of the power. In the case of odd powers, these uniquely determine the last three digits of the root, but in the case of even roots, like this one, this method yields four possibilities; in the case of 144 they are 014, 264, 514, and 764. (The choices always differ by 250.) To select the correct one Klein divides the original number by 13 and retains the remainder. In the case of 13th roots, the root remainder and the power remainder must be the same. The power remainder is 7; only 764 as the final three digits of the root will yield 7 as the remainder. Thus the 13th root is determined to be 42,500,764.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we will see, there are multiple endings possible when the 13th power ends in 2, 4, 6, or 8, so these are not going to be record attempts. In fact, the above account appears to be unique; other accounts of 13th roots are limited to odd final digits, and the method described in Part II of this paper is also limited to odd final digits.</p>
<p>Here is Klein’s account for another 13th power, also from Smith:</p>
<p>75185285487713563581947553291145079861723813162341<br>
53935861550997297991815299022662358976308065985831</p>
<hr>
<p>The first five digits of the power are 75185, which is nearly 7519, and 7519 is 73 times 103. The mantissa of the log of 73 is 0.86332 and that of 103 is 0.01284. Their sum is 0.87616. Dividing 8.87616 by 13 yields 0.68278. This falls between the mantissas of the logs of 48 and 49, but is much closer to 48. Since 481 is 13 (mantissa 0.11394) times 37 (mantissa 0.56820), the mantissa of its log will be 0.68214; close, but still a bit low; 4,816 can be factored into 16 (mantissa 0.20412) times 7 (mantissa 0.84510) times 43 (mantissa 0.63347). This gives a mantissa of 0.68269. Then 4,818 factors into 66 (mantissa 0.81954) times 73 (mantissa 0.86332), which yields a mantissa of 0.68286. Thus, in the interpolation we want 9/17 of 20 which is about 10 1/2. The first five digits of the root should be 48170 (48160 + 10). This, in fact, is correct.</p>
<p>When Klein actually did the calculation he made a minor error (he was looking for the antilog of 0.68277 instead of 0.68278) and first took 48169 for the first five digits of the root. In this case, however, since the root is odd, the last three digits are uniquely fixed—since the power ends in 831, the root must end in 311. Upon dividing the power by 13 Klein got a remainder of 7. But dividing 48,169,311 by 13 gives a remainder of 8. To make these two remainders come into line he changed his solution to 48,170,311, which is correct.</p>

<p>I’ll confess: I use a GUI for Git. Not always, and not even most of the time. The CLI is usually quicker, and I’m usually in the terminal anyway, but yet I also use a GUI. Why? Primarily for reviewing diffs and history, or for performing rarely used operations. I mean, I can google “cherry pick” for those rare times I use it, or I can choose it from the menu and not worry about mangling things in Git history.</p>



<p>I’m a long-time user of <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/mac">Tower</a> on macOS. It’s beautiful, intuitive, feature-rich, and powerful. Updates come frequently, and they even have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/">cool merch</a>. I have <a href="https://stuff.git-tower.com/products/the-dev-manifesto">this</a> hanging by my desk at the office I haven’t seen since mid-March. I assume it’s still there. They also offer <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/windows">Tower for Windows</a>. What they <em>don’t</em> have, however, is a Linux version (preemptive snark: “That’s because people who use Linux don’t use GUIs!”).</p>



<h2>Closed Source: GitKraken</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/242/~best-graphical-git-clients-for-linux">asked Slant what Linux Git GUI was best</a>, sifted through some editor plugins and “minimal” clients, and decided to try <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>. I’d tried GitKraken on macOS years ago, and thought it had promise. Back then, though, I’d already cast my lot (and my money) with Tower, so I never dug into GitKraken. Now, it was time.</p>



<p>I installed GitKraken and began using it. It ticked all the boxes for me: intuitive, beautiful, and feature-rich. After a few days using it, I decided to show my support by purchasing a license (preemptive snark: “People who use Linux don’t pay for software!”). GitKraken offers three flavors:</p>



<ol><li>Free (“For open source developers”)</li><li>Individual (“For individual developers” — $29/year)</li><li>Pro (“For teams and companies” — $49/year)</li></ol>



<p>See more information on <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing">their page</a>. Among other things, Individual lets you access private repositories. Pro adds enterprise features: user management, GitHub Enterprise, etc. The tiers and features make sense. It’s a reasonable approach. Since I have no enterprise needs, but I <em>do</em> want to work with private repositories, I paid $29 for an Individual license. And I continued to use GitKraken.</p>



<p>After some days or weeks of use, I decided to really dig into GitKraken’s settings and understand its suite of offerings. I found the Preferences screens, and saw I could configure an External Editor and a Default Terminal. When I tried to select a different editor, I saw that my only option was “&lt;None&gt;”:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences.png 484w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-300x99.png 300w, https://www.grailbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/preferences-320x105.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"><figcaption>GitKraken Preferences</figcaption></figure>



<p>I poked around a little bit in the UI, ran a few google searches, and came up empty on how to resolve this. I saw a menu item in GitKraken, though, that said, “Send Us Feedback,” so I sent the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m using GitKraken 7.0 on Pop!_os 20.04. In Preferences -&gt; General, both the External Editor and Default Terminal dropdowns have &lt;None&gt; as the only option. How can I configure these?</p></blockquote>



<p>The reply came back:</p>



<blockquote><p>Thank you for taking the time to reach out to support. We currently do not provide support for free accounts. For guaranteed support please upgrade to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing"><strong>GitKraken Pro</strong></a>. Additionally, it’s important to note that the GitKraken Git GUI does not support Pop!_OS. Our team does not test again this distro and we cannot guarantee that the GitKraken Git GUI will behave properly. If you have installed the GUI via snap please try one of the alternative install options detailed here, https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install/#linux-deb-rpm-and-targz-files. If you require additional assistance please upgrade to GitKraken Pro.</p></blockquote>



<p>I assumed a mistake had occurred — true, I didn’t have a Pro account, but nor was I using a Free account. I started to reply that I wasn’t a Free user, but first I checked the features of the different pricing tiers. Indeed, they provide email support only for the Pro edition. A customer paying at the Individual level has no support recourse. The support individual hadn’t made a mistake (other than getting my license wrong) — he had followed protocol. Now, I felt a little miffed. Dismissed. At the least, they could have said something like: “Thanks for pointing this out. We are developing a support document that addresses where this information comes from to help you troubleshoot,” or something that sounded like they cared. Still, I hadn’t done my homework when I made my purchase. The terms were right there. I should have paid more attention.</p>



<p>I briefly considered throwing them $20 more just so they’d have to fix this for me, but realized they’d almost certainly stand firm on not supporting Pop!_OS. So I reformatted my hard drive and installed Ubuntu . . . just kidding. I kept my $20. And I tried to solve this myself. Things I tried:</p>



<ul><li>Find the configuration file: check</li><li>Add good-guess entries to the configuration file: didn’t work</li><li>Install VS Code to see if it it would show up in the dropdown: didn’t work</li><li>Install and configure GitKraken on my MacBook Pro with an External Editor and see what the configuration file should <em>really</em> look like: check</li><li>Duplicate the configuration file on my Linux box: didn’t work</li></ul>



<p>At this point, I ran out of steam. GitKraken is an Electron app, if I’m not mistaken, so I suppose I could have tried digging into obfuscated JavaScript. I’ve seen what WebPack can do, though, and I also figured the license I’d agreed to prevented such action, so I surrendered and looked for another Git GUI.</p>



<h2>Open Source: Guitar</h2>



<p>I don’t remember how I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar">Guitar</a> — I assumed Slant, but I don’t see it now on the list so must have been a random Internet search that led me to it. I installed it, used it, and liked it. Not quite as intuitive or beautiful as GitKraken, but I soon got the hang of it and I was off and running.</p>



<p>One day, though, I wanted to amend a commit. In Tower, the commit dialog has a checkbox for amending a commit. Guitar has no such checkbox. I poked around a little, then dashed to the command line to amend the commit and made a mental note to follow up.</p>



<p>When I got around to following up, I found <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/issues/53">this issue</a> asking for an option to amend a commit. The response from the developer pointed out that the option existed, albeit using a different interface mechanism: a context menu. I right-clicked one of my commits in the Guitar GUI and didn’t see the “Edit message…” option. I didn’t understand why. This time, though, I could do something about it.</p>



<p>I cloned the Guitar repository, fired up <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools">Qt Creator</a>, followed <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/blob/master/docs/build_guide-en/build_guide_origin.md">the build instructions</a>, and was able to launch Guitar in the debugger. I looked through the code, which was clean and straightforward. Easy to follow — and this, for a guy who only recently learned that <a href="https://ariya.io/2009/01/qt-not-qt">Qt is pronounced “cute.”</a> (Note: I find that pronunciation more unsettling than Jay-Double-you-Tee being pronounced “jot,” but no one consulted me on either.)</p>



<p>I soon found the part of the code that draws the context menu in question, set a breakpoint, and stepped through the code. I learned that it adds that menu item to the context menu of a commit if:</p>



<ul><li>It’s the latest commit</li><li>There are no uncommitted changes in the working copy</li><li>The commit has not been pushed to a remote</li></ul>



<p>So the feature works as the developer designed: you can edit the message, but not the content, of the commit. In other words, you can’t add a file to a commit to amend it. And I could figure all that out because the code was open source. I could see it. Step through it. Know exactly what was happening. And I can change that behavior, if I want, and offer it to others who want the same behavior.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Here’s where I say that Open Source is categorically better than Closed Source. I can’t do it, though. It’s not categorically better. It’s better in some ways and worse in others. It optimizes some things at the expense of others. It worked in my favor, above, allowing me to troubleshoot and resolve my own issue.</p>



<p>As commercial software, however, GitKraken generates sufficient revenue to have (presumably) developers, designers, product owners, and support staff working on it full time. It’s more intuitive and better looking than Guitar. It offers ticket tracking boards and project timelines and integration with other tools. And as long as you pay $49/year and run a supported operating system, you can get email support for it. In contrast, I’m guessing that Guitar is a side project for <a href="https://github.com/soramimi">its developer</a>. They get no money from it. It puts no food on the table. They work on it as they have time. And I keep saying “they” because English has no genderless singular third-person pronoun, but you can see <a href="https://github.com/soramimi/Guitar/graphs/contributors">soramimi does most of the work</a>. It’s a labor of love, and a gift to the community. </p>



<p>This is where the pedant points out that you don’t have to be closed source to be commercial. That’s true only in theory, as the recent <a href="https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/4111">hapi flap</a> reminds us.</p>



<p>Life is full of trade-offs. Software is one of them. I’ll go on using some closed source and some open source, paying for some software and using some for free. I’m going to thank the developer of Guitar for all their work. I’ll be writing a patch for Guitar that allows you to amend a commit by adding a file. I’ll check it in using a Git GUI. I’ll let you guess which one.</p>

<h2>Fair Use and Exigent Circumstances</h2>



<p>

*<em>The opinions and scholarship communicated on this website are the author’s own, expressed in his personal capacity.*</em></p>



<p>If you work in any of the higher ed institutions that are preparing to move online – maybe your copyright world has exploded in a range of questions on fair use, e-reserves, online access, scanning, digitization, and more! I am sure many of you, especially in the library community, are working towards the best solution for students, faculty, staff, and patrons in this time of crisis. </p>



<p>To help you navigate this process, over the next few posts  (working as I go) I will offer reminders of all the super awesome legal tools libraries have for copyright as “stewards of access” in our communities.</p>



<p>As I have often messaged, libraries and archives have “superpowers” under the copyright law that allows us to supply our communities with access to materials for research, scholarship, and study. Most notably, these statutory exemptions were granted to libraries and archives by Congress to ensure our continued public mission. Further, libraries can utilize technology to <em>enhance</em> access to materials. Adapting and utilizing technology for the benefit of our patrons is something that libraries and archives have been successful at for decades – from the first photocopiers in libraries, microfiche, computer labs,  to 3-D printers! </p>



<p>So, in times like this COVID-19 crisis, let’s continue to harness both law and technology to help!</p>



<p>Before I get to the TEACH Act, Section 108, or any other superpower – first and foremost, we must talk about <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107">fair use</a>. While this isn’t a library superpower – <strong>fair use is for everyone!</strong> – it certainly falls to the libraries and archives, in many circumstances, to be the champions of fair use on campus (and bust any fair use myths!)</p>



<figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-1024x557.jpg 1024w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-300x163.jpg 300w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie-768x418.jpg 768w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fair-Use-Rosie.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In questions I’ve received, tweets I’ve been following, and posts to the Copyright First Responders lists about libraries’ responses to COVID-19, what is pervasive is the sense that this isn’t a normal “par for the course” moment. These are exigent circumstances with a limited timeline, and we, as libraries, have a strong mission and public purpose. In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and ensuing campus closures, we can make use of the “release valve” that fair use offers. We have a lot of space to support our communities in this moment as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of instructors and students for the rest of the semester. In doing so, we are applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly. We are not crafting permanent policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, copyright law does not always restrict uses. In many cases a solid understanding of fair use can help ease fears, provide legal alternatives to a particular request, or help educate the higher education community at large. </p>



<p>Again, as long as we’re being thoughtful, <em>providing good copyright information when asked</em>, and limiting our activities to the&nbsp;specific, <em>time-bound needs</em> of our communities for the rest of this timeline, we are in a good place to have a strong fair use analysis. <br></p>



<p>Yes, we are still applying fair use prudently and managing risk sensibly, but we can do that and clearly meet our user’s needs!  </p>



<p>Just to be clear: Fair use is a flexible limitation on copyright which states “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106” (the copyright owner’s rights) “the fair use of a copyrighted work…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research” is not an infringement of copyright. And then we are given the famous four-factor test to make that risk determination.</p>



<p>Again, let me emphasize “<strong>flexible!</strong>” Fair use is flexible and, as the Supreme Court stated in<em> <a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</a></em><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/assets/files/2LiveCrew.pdf">, 510 U.S. 569 (1994)</a> “permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute.” So, if fair use is found, it is, according to the Copyright Act, “not an infringement of copyright.”</p>



<p>The
mechanics underpinning fair use were codified in the Copyright Act with the
famous four factors: 1) the purpose and character of the use, 2) the nature of
the work copied, 3) the amount and substantiality of the work used, and 4) the
effect on the market for the original. One has to examine all four factors for
each individual use to make a fair use determination. </p>



<p>For
the purposes of this blog post, let’s explore a fictional request to scan some
materials for a class that is forced to move to online as a result of a
COVID-19 closure. Below we will make our way through each of the four factors with
an eye to ask some questions and gain an understanding of making a fair use determination
for this sort of scenario.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four.jpg 296w, https://kylecourtney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fair-use-four-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor One – Purpose and Character:</strong> The first fair use factor, “purpose and character of the use,” is illustrated by the examples that is part of the fair use statute preamble: <em>criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.</em> Clearly our colleagues working at non-profit educational institutions have a good start for a fair use determination right away. Our use is clearly for the benefit of research and education!  </p>



<p>Additionally, let’s put this first factor in the context of the COVID-19 closure scenario. Well, this particular “purpose” is allowing faculty and students to access the materials they need in a public emergency where they are facing quarantines, social distancing, or campus/library closures. This is strong evidence, I believe, for favoring fair use in the “purpose and character” factor. </p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Two – Nature of Copyrighted Work:</strong> </p>



<p>When
determining whether our COVID-19-related scanning request is a fair use under
the second factor, we must ask ourselves a couple of questions about the work
at hand: Is it published or unpublished; and how “creative” is the original
work?</p>



<p>While
the law is more protective of unpublished work, because authors have right to
decide whether and when they will make their work public, courts have largely
ignored this factor, with some calling it “neutral” in many recent decisions.
Certainly, many higher ed courses use both factual works and creative works.</p>



<p>Certainly do not see this factor as dispositive of the entire fair use test – let’s move forward to the next factor!</p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Three – Amount and Substantiality Used:</strong> The third factor receives major discussion in both court cases and scholarship surrounding fair use. A common question that examines this factor derives directly from the critical facts in most fair use cases: <em>How much is being used?</em> If it’s a smaller amount of a copyrighted work, it favors fair use. But what about a request for an entire work?</p>



<p><strong>Well, despite any myths you may have heard, it can be fair to use an entire work</strong>. However, it must be a justified fair use. The important thing to remember is that the law favors using the right amount necessary to serve the users purpose. There are no bright lines when it comes to what percentage of the copyrighted work is too much and typically, the higher the percentage, the more likely this factor is to count against fair use.</p>



<p>However, let’s apply this to a new common COVID-19 scenario: The use of a book when the campus moves online. Maybe we consider that we do not scan the whole textbook, unless it is absolutely necessary. And it may be absolutely necessary! And it also may not be! The factor is assessed based on the facts of the scenario.</p>



<p>For example, a class may have already covered Chapters 1-7 for the first part of the semester – and now, moving online, they need chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester. The library may have used fair use analysis to tailored this request to the needs of the faculty and students. This action is employing part of the fair use rationale that states that one should use only the amount necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>The syllabus certainly helps with calculating the need and amount used. I have observed recommendations making materials available to students that are measured by the class syllabus <strong>from the “move online” moment </strong>to the<strong> end of the semester.</strong> Now, that might be more than any library policy “rules of thumb” that normally exist. But again, this is not the normal policy – and wouldn’t be representative of the factual scenarios we are being presented with now with the COVD-19 crisis. Fair use decisions are rendered case-by-case, thankfully, and we can look to amount needed as necessary to serve the purpose.</p>



<p>Now, here’s another novel issue. What if the student needs access to the book for studying for the final test? Chapters 1-7, which were previously only available on reserve (or left behind in the abandoned dorm room) are now inaccessible. Can we expand the digitization request beyond chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 to finished out the semester ? Again, we have to look at the limited use, timing, and exigent circumstances of this scenario. Use the same standard as always used under factor three: <em>the use should use only copy the amount necessary to serve the purpose </em></p>



<p><strong>Fair Use Factor Four – Market Effect:</strong> This is another factor that gets a lot of discussion both in the fair use court cases and commentary. The question often revolves around whether the proposed use will cut into the potential market or value of the work. And we have seen court cases stating that using a copyrighted work in a way that means lost sales to the copyright owner will weigh against fair use.</p>

July 24, 2020 | https://alexkuc.github.io/articles/create-remote-dev-server-part-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkuc.github.io/articles/create-remote-dev-server-part-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts#requirements">repository</a> contains a concise summary. It contains the bare minimum required to get started. The aim of this article is to provide more in-depths tutorial.
      </p>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          In <a href="https://alexkuc.github.io/articles/create-remote-dev-server/" target="_blank">part one</a>, I have shown how to create a remote development using DigitalOcean and rsync. In part two, I will show how to automate the entire process using Bash script.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get started, you will need to install and configure the dependencies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>DigitalOcean account</li>
          <li>Bash, at least version 4</li>
          <li>doctl</li>
          <li>rsync (<code>do.sh sync</code>)</li>
          <li>fswatch (<code>do.sh watch</code>)</li>
          <li>scp (<code>do.sh copy</code> <code>do.sh scp</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once that is done, clone <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts" target="_blank">the repository</a>. You can either set it up as a sub-module or as a standalone repo. To make <code>do.sh</code> be accessible from anywhere, copy it or symlink it into your <code>PATH</code>, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The droplet can be configured using either Bash or yaml configs where examples of both are available in the repository. You would need to call the script either from one level up from <code>do.sh</code> or export environment variable <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> with a different path.
        </p>
        <p>
          This script allows a certain degree of flexibility via <a href="#env-vars">environment variables</a>. For instance, the config used can be specified via <code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code>. If you require a greater degree of customizability, you can either submit a PR or fork the repository.
        </p>
        <hr>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <ul>
            <li>one-button solution, to get started, do: <code>do.sh start</code></li>
            <li>suport command chaining, e.g. <code>do.sh up prep sync</code></li>
            <li>overwritable settings (environment variables)</li>
            <li>separate command <code>cmd</code> to rewrite path in output</li>
            <li>ssh socket to avoid constant reconnection</li>
            <li>singleton pattern: avoid creating more than 1 droplet at a time</li>
            <li>a number of useful built-in commands to type less</li>
            <li>for more details, please see <a href="https://github.com/alexkuc/remote-dev-server-scripts" target="_blank">the repository</a></li>
          </ul>
        <hr>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          Using <code>do.sh</code> is very simple. To get started, type <code>do.sh help</code> which will show you a list of available commands. <em>Some</em> commands support chaining, e.g., <code>do.sh up prep sync</code> which will run in sequential order. Generally, you can chain commands which have a fixed number of arguments such as <code>up</code> or <code>down</code>. Commands like <code>ssh</code>, <code>cmd</code> and <code>copy</code> can have any number of arguments so these do not support chaining. A good workaround is to add these commands at the very end, e.g. <code>do.sh up copy file1 file2 file3</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a list of available commands: <code>up         create dev server *
down       destory dev server *
reset      re-create dev server *
sync       rsync from local to remote *
watch      watch local for changes and sync
deps       install Node deps on remote *
prep[are]  shortcut for sync -&gt; deps -&gt; watch
ssh        start interactive ssh session
ssh &lt;cmd&gt;  execute command on droplet
cmd &lt;cmd&gt;  ssh &lt;cmd&gt; and replace cwd with local
scp &lt;path&gt; copy from remote to local (cwd)
copy&lt;path&gt; copy from local to remote (~/.repo/)
cp &lt;path&gt;  alias to copy command
dist       shortcut to copying dist/ from remote *
host       show public ip of remote *
config     create config from env var CLOUD_CONFIG *
help       show available commands

* these commands support chaining, e.g. do.sh up prep sync</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of my workflow. I start with <code>up</code>, followed by <code>prep</code>. As this script supports chaining, here is what I do: <code>do.sh up prep</code>. If I need to run a command after copying files, I execute <code>do.sh sync cmd &lt;cmd&gt;</code>. Path re-write is useful if I want to be able to copy and paste path from the error stack straight away (<code>cmd</code>). For instance, I use iTerm which supports semantic history and with path re-write, I can open files directly from console on my local system.
        </p>
        <hr>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          This script supports so-called settings via environment variables overrides. Here is a list of supported overrides:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>NAME</code> name of the droplet, defaults to <code>dev-server</code></li>
          <li><code>IMAGE</code> os (image) to be used, defaults to <code>ubuntu-20-04-x64</code></li>
          <li><code>SPECS</code> droplet specs, defaults to <code>s-2vcpu-2gb</code>; find out more specs by running <code>doctl compute size list</code></li>
          <li><code>REGION</code> droplet datacenter, defaults to <code>lon1</code></li>
          <li><code>CLOUD_CONFIG</code> location of cloud config, defaults to <code>./dev-server/cloud-config.yml</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_KEY</code> local path to private ssh key, defaults to <code>~/.ssh/developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_USER</code> ssh user, defaults to <code>developer</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST</code> ssh host, defaults to none; the value is configured at runtime when <code>up</code> command is run and saved to <code>SSH_OUTPUT</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_SOCKET</code> local path for ssh socket, defaults to none; once <code>SSH_HOST</code> is available, the value becomes <code>${HOME}/.ssh/sockets/$SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on remote host, configured at runtime</li>
          <li><code>LOCAL_CWD</code> value of <code>pwd</code> on local host</li>
          <li><code>SSH_HOST_FILE</code> local path where <code>SSH_HOST</code> value is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_host</code></li>
          <li><code>SSH_CWD_FILE</code> local path where <code>pwd</code> of remote host is saved, defaults to <code>/tmp/dev_ssh_cwd</code></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>If you ever tried to make a Geo-location service (e.g. define a user country based on user IP address), most likely you heard about <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/">MaxMind</a>. </p>
<p>MaxMind - is probably one of best companies who provides Geo IP databases and services. </p>
<p>However, there is a number of limitations: if you're making a side-project, most likely you do not want to pay extra $$$ for geolocation services. And for this case MaxMind offers GeoLite2 database, however you'll be in charge of hosting this database on your server and making regular updates of the database. You also need to make sure your project is compliant with MaxMind's License.</p>
<h2>Why to use Cloudflare Workers instead of AWS Lambda?</h2>
<p>In this particular example, I needed a simple geo-location service which will be used in embeddable javascript code (similar to Google Analytics or other tracking service), so the response time is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In my first attempt I tried to use Serverless framework to host simple geo-location function on AWS Lambda (this function uses MaxMind GeoLite2 database). However, I quickly realized that the response time isn't what I've expected - on average the response took somewhere between from 200ms to 500ms. So I started looking for other options.  </p>
<p>So, I thought - if I could not host it on AWS Lambda, where else I could host my serverless function? The next service I tried - is <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>. I created a simple function to test the reponse time, and it was really impressive - on average it was between from 30ms to 80ms, I've got almost x10 better performance in comparison to AWS. </p>
<p>However, this solution had one really big caveat - MaxMind GeoLite2 database does not work on Cloudflare Workers due to some runtime limitations.</p>
<h2>MaxMind alternative</h2>
<p>And then I thought - hey, wait a second, as Cloudflare provides DDoS protection services, they might provide some interesting features in Cloudflare Workers. And after exploring their documentation, I realized that the <code>Request</code> object in function have an access to <code>cf</code> object, which contains some useful information about the visitor, including visitor's country!</p>
<p>That's exactly what I was looking for, within a few dozens of lines of code I got my geolocation function up and running.</p>
<h2>The source code</h2>
<p>If you haven't worked with Cloudflare before, you need to signup at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare.com</a> and go to Workers directory.</p>
<p>Then, create a new worker with the following source code:</p>

<p>Then you can start making requests to your Worker's endpoint.</p>    </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>React Native for Windows released latest stable <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-windows/v/0.62.2">0.62.2</a> with Fast Refresh, RTL support, RedBox and thread safe property storage APIs.</p>
<!--truncate-->
<p>Aligning with our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/releases">releases strategy</a>, we are happy to announce the general availability of stable latest <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-windows/v/0.62.2">0.62.2 version</a> of React Native for Windows. You can try it out using our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started">Getting Started Instructions</a>. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/releases/tag/react-native-windows_v0.62.0">release notes</a> for highlights and breaking changes, more details below. A corresponding update for React Native for macOS is in progress.</p>
<h2>Fast Refresh</h2>
<p>Fast Refresh is a great developer productivity feature introduced in React Native in 0.61 as a new and improved version of "hot reloading" and "live reloading". Read more about this : <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh">Fast Refresh in React Native</a>. With 0.62, we have brought Fast Refresh to React Native for Windows:</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="fast-refresh-on-windows"></p>
<h2>Microsoft.ReactNative APIs</h2>
<p>Several updates have been made to provide thread safe, higher performance instance management on React Native for Windows through new Microsoft.ReactNative APIs. The deprecated ReactUwp framework is no longer supported with 0.62. Read our documentation on these for more, few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/reactapplication-api">ReactApplication</a> : Base Application class for use in applications that are entirely written in react-native</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/reactnativehost-api">ReactNativeHost</a> : Entry point to create a new react-native instance</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/reactinstancesettings-api">ReactInstanceSettings</a> : Provides configuration of the react-native instance</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/ireactcontext-api">ReactContext</a> : Given to native modules to communicate with other native modules, views, application, and the react-native instance</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/ireactpropertybag-api">ReactPropertyBag</a> : Provides a thread-safe property storage</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/xamluiservice-api">XamlUIService</a> : Provides access to XAML UI specific functionality. See <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/view-managers">Native UI components</a> for more details on the changes to <code>ViewManager</code> APIs.</li>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/iredboxhandler-api">RedBoxHandler</a> : Provides an extension point to allow custom error handling within the react-native instance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alignment with core</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing alignment with React Native core we have added Windows support for several new APIs introduced in ReactNative 0.62. Few callouts here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/appearance">Appearance</a> module is now supported on Windows. You can use this module to get information on the user's dark/light theme preferences and apply the right styling as needed. Windows previously had <code>AppTheme</code> APIs that are now deprecated in favor of aligning with React Native core.</li>
<li><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#focusable">focusable</a> prop is now supported on <code>View</code> and <code>TextInput</code>. You can use this prop to indicate whether a component can be focusable (participate in tab order) when navigating with keyboard. Windows previously had an <code>acceptsKeyboardFocus</code> prop that is now deprecated in favor of aligning with React Native core.</li>
<li><strong>RTL Support in Windows</strong> : Windows now supports <code>forceRTL</code> and <code>allowRTL</code> modules. Auto-detect and applying RTL when app is running in RTL locale is in progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/rtl.gif" alt="rtl"></p>
<h2>WinUI 3</h2>
<p>The Windows UI Library (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI</a>) is the native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and UWP applications. WinUI is the path forward for all native Windows apps. React Native for Windows is layered on top of WinUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/">WinUI 3</a> is the next version of WinUI, completely decoupled from the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/">Windows 10 SDK</a> to enable faster shipping of UI features, more backward compatability and to simplify building of version adaptive apps. We are working in close alignment to add WinUI 3 support for React Native for Windows in order to ensure we are always tracking against the latest in native Windows platform. If you are curious, you can try out an experimental preview of this work using the optional flag <code>--useWinUI3</code> when running <code>react-native-windows-init</code>. You can read more about this effort <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/winui3">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Coming up next</h2>
<p>We will continue to keep up with React Native core versions: 0.63 upgrade for Windows is ongoing with a planned preview for August 2020. In addition, several updates are coming up for React Native for Windows core including support for <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking-libraries-ios#automatic-linking">automatic linking of community modules</a> and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#logbox">LogBox support</a>.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to add Windows support to key community modules, ongoing work includes <a href="https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation">react-navigation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-slider">react-native-slider</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/progress-view">react-native-progressview</a> and several others.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Since the GPT-3's demos have stormed Twitter, more and more devs are getting anxious about how this would affect their jobs in the future. I think the tweet that has struck the developers the most is the one by Sharif Shameen</p>

<p>If anyone can create UI and generate React code just by describing it in plain English, why would any company hire a Frontend Developer anymore? </p>
<p>Let's start by getting a little more context about GPT-3</p>
<h2 id="what-is-gpt-3-">What is GPT-3?</h2>

<p><strong>Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) — 3,</strong> in simple words, is a pre-trained model that can explore the internet for answers and generate responses in a contextual way. This is why it is able to start giving predictions even when provided with a small input. You can check out Paul's demo for more context.</p>

<h2 id="how-gpt-3-will-help-evolve-your-jobs-rather-than-taking-it">How GPT-3 will help evolve your jobs rather than taking it</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Products like <a href="http://debuild.co/" target="_blank">debuild.co</a>, should we even bother learning Frontend development?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fear of AI taking on all our jobs has been the topic of discussion for years now, and since GPT-3, developers are able to see this happening to them sooner than later.  This is the same situation when people were of the impression that firebase will kill backend jobs, and products like Netlify and Vercel will kill Cloud engineering jobs, but on the contrary, all these services have played a role in increasing the job market. It has been empowering more and more startups to rise up with low initial investment, and these startups in turn hire more engineers when they want to scale up.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one should consider GPT-3 to be the milestone in AI which will lead us to the next evolution of the way we work. </p>

<h2 id="the-concept-of-priming-in-gpt-3-models">The Concept of Priming in GPT-3 models</h2>
<p>The biggest reason why GPT-3 is a potential game-changer in AI tech is that anyone can use this without having to find a dataset for the ML to start predicting as expected, few inputs will help you get exceptional results. That being said the quality of input is definitely a factor for the results that you get. This is where the concept of priming comes up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Priming is giving the model a series of input and expected outputs which should be easy for the model to calculate context and create a guide for itself for future inputs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend you to look into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@IntuitMachine">Carlos' pieces</a> if you want to dive deeper into how priming works starting from the one mentioned below</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3-bc12f67c9777">The Subtle Art of Priming GPT-3</a></p>
<p>According to the material that is out there as of now, it seems that using GPT-3, it would become extremely easy to create a super tool for a niche use-case, but there is still time for it to be mature enough to replace a whole field of work. </p>

<p>You can follow Swyx's repo to be up to date with all things GPT-3</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sw-yx/gpt3-list">sw-yx/gpt3-list</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is the closest we can get to have something like Jarvis from Iron man so that should be something that can be exciting</p>
<p>I think the best way to handle this new progress in AI is to sit tight and be curious about how this can change the way developers would be building products in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> is now beta. This is the first usable incarnation of our vision of moldable development. We still have plenty of things we want to do, but now we can say that the large technical challenges are behind us.
</p>
<p>
Many things have changed since our previous release from a year ago. The GitHub repository says we addressed more than 900 issues spanning from deep technical issues to creating a whole new visible user interface. Essentially, much of the current system has been developed or redeveloped during last year.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a tour through the highlights.
</p>
<p>
Before we look at the cool technical details, let's pause for a second and consider our goal of making the inside of software systems explainable. To reach this goal, first and foremost, we focus on reimagining how developers read code. Glamorous Toolkit does bring innovations in how we write code, but it is the reading where we make the most difference. Developers alone spend 50+% of their time reading code. That is the single largest activity in software development and we reimagine how this effort is being spent from the ground up. The result is what we call moldable development and we are now confident in saying that it is a novel way of approaching programming. 
</p>
<p>
To get a feeling of what it means, please scroll down and look briefly at the screenshots. Notice how they look rather distinct from one another. Software is highly contextual. We want the environment to mold to that context and depict it distinctly, too.
</p>
<p>
Ok, enough of that. Let's go on with the show.
</p>
<p>
A good chunk of the effort went into making Glamorous Toolkit run in native windows reliably. We are now happy to announce that it now works for Mac, Windows and Linux.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-home.png" alt="The home tab of Glamorous Toolkit">
	<figcaption>The home tab of Glamorous Toolkit</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
This is an important step not only for the looks of it, but also internally. If until now we were bootstrapping inside the graphical support from Pharo, now we get to control the complete rendering. We are still able to spawn the old Morphic World interface on demand. In this way, people that are used to Pharo can enjoy the interface of the new environment while still being able to rely on old tools when needed.
</p>
<p>
To be able a high degree of moldability, the environment's frame must impose little constraints.
</p>
<p>
In our case, the frame essentially knows a home tab that we can easily mold, a menu that we can make moldable, and a way to search that is already moldable. This is it. No elaborate global menus. No hardcoded views. We can do this because the actions are bundled with the context in which they apply.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Glamorous Toolkit offers a tabbed interface</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder offers the means through which we manipulate static code. The work on Coder started from the need to mold  the experience for the smallest unit of code organization: the method. We started from the editor for a single method and built the rest of the experience around it.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see a search through the system revealing methods that can be individually viewed and modified in place. In this particular case, we expand one inner method only to look for references of an instance variable, and this, in turn, opens another list on the right. Using this simple mechanism we can transform any Playground into a powerful code query tool and a scoped code browser.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-playground-search-two-filters.png" alt="Example of a queries and previews as method snippets">
	<figcaption>Example of a queries and previews as method snippets</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Coder can be molded in several ways. For example, below we see the baseline defining the dependencies of the Bloc project. Each dependency is defined through a string denoting the name of the dependency. Coder recognizes the API and allows us to expand the string right in place to browse the corresponding dependency.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-coder-baseline.png" alt="Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies">
	<figcaption>Example of a baseline method with expanded dependencies</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The environment is classically seen as being specific to a language. We believe moldability must be much finer grained:  all tools must be made adjustable within the context of code. In our case, we bring that ability to the individual instruction.
</p>
<p>
Playground and Inspector are the core tools that enable live exploration. They were significantly consolidated. The core mechanism remained the same, but now they are complemented with a few abilities.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-playground-inspector.png" alt="Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground">
	<figcaption>Example of a Playground, connected Inspectors and an object Playground</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
First, error handling. Inspector is extensible by third party code. At the same time, as it is the most basic tool we have in the environment, it is critical that these extensions cannot  break the inspector. So, now we have a fine grained handlers that gracefully show errors without breaking the Inspector.
</p>
<p>
Another part is preserving the history in Playground. On each code execution we store the Playground's content on disk. This also works for code we are writing in the context of an object.
</p>
<p>
But, perhaps most important is that we brought the full coding experience into both Inspector and Playground. When inspecting an object, the Meta view offers a Coder on the class of the object. Particularly interesting is that the value of <code>self</code> is bound to the inspected object. This ability allows us to promote programming in Inspector in the presence of live objects. More recently, we went a step further and extended the Playground coding experience as well. This includes the ability to create classes and methods right in place.
</p>
<p>
A consequence is that we can now use the expansion mechanisms to peek into code wherever we are, including the Playground and Inspector. Through this, we do not go to where the code is. The code shows up where we are. That is the humane way.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>
Spotter is the moldable search interface.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-spotter.png" alt="Example of a Spotter search">
	<figcaption>Example of a Spotter search</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Just like how an object can tell the Inspector how it can be viewed, it can also tell Spotter how it can be searched. This simple ability can then be combined in many different ways to support various use cases from navigating through code or the file system, to pasting external urls to open them within the environment.
</p>
<p>
While Spotter is prominently available globally, we also integrated it with Inspector and Coder. For example, when editing a class, Coder offers a Spotter to search within the context of that class.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Searching within the context of a class from within Coder</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Debugger saw significant improvements, too. The stack is made of the same snippets as found in Coder or in Playground. And it can be seamlessly integrated in the inspection flow.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-debugger-inspector.png" alt="A debugger and an inspector on a variable">
	<figcaption>A debugger and an inspector on a variable</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter is the engine with which we assemble narratives. We use it for documenting classes, or we use it for describing business cases or architectural descriptions. For example, here we see a Coder with a document as a class comment. Clicking on a link opens up another document, essentially transforming the whole image into a wiki.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-documenter-faces.png" alt="Browsing through live documents">
	<figcaption>Browsing through live documents</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Documenter saw several developments, and it became faster and more usable. We achieved this by making the previews render lazily.
</p>
<p>
The different tools are wired together in a broader flow we call Pager that embeds tools as pages connected in a Miller columns interface. The novelty is that tools are now first class and can appear at arbitrary locations in a larger flow.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-pager.png" alt="Example of a Pager showing three different tools (Documenter, Coder, Inspector) in a single flow">
	<figcaption>Example of a Pager showing three different tools (Documenter, Coder, Inspector) in a single flow</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Beside documents, another pervasive medium to express narratives are slideshows. Presenter offers exactly that, only in our case, the slides are live. Each slide is essentially a scoped environment and can be used for various purposes. For example, the Tour slideshow offers an overview of Glamorous Toolkit, each slide exemplifying a separate concept or tool.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-presenter.png" alt="The Glamorous Toolkit Tour slideshow. The preview offers the slides as navigation.">
	<figcaption>The Glamorous Toolkit Tour slideshow. The preview offers the slides as navigation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
A narrative can take multiple forms. In the environment we already have  documents or slideshows. And now we have a hybrid: A way to combine text with a target graphical scene and offer seamless links between the two.
</p>
<p>
For example, below we see an explanation text on the left. On the right, we see a piece of code denoting the definition of an inspector view and a preview of the rendering for a specific object. Hovering over the highlighted words visually link to the corresponding parts in the code and in the scene.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-explainer-columnedList.png" alt="Example of using Explainer to document how the code of a view maps on the visuals">
	<figcaption>Example of using Explainer to document how the code of a view maps on the visuals</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Visualizer makes visualization a first-class citizen in the environment. It contains a few programmable engines including Mondrian, for drawing graphs, an initial Plotter for drawing charts, or Connector, for identifying connections between various objects.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/glamorous-toolkit-v0-7-1214-beta-2uv9ne4vyynvcv08kcm07cihz/pictures/gtr-visualizer.png" alt="Examples of visualization">
	<figcaption>Examples of visualization</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Transcript is a basic console. Now, text is quaint, but we have to outgrow it. And, you should not use Transcript for debugging purposes either. But if you must, at least you can do it with style. For example, if you have an exception that you want to print, the whole exception stack is inspectable right from the Transcript. Why? Because we can, and because doing it any other way would be not glamorous enough.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Example of using the Transcript API</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The first non-Pharo language fully supported by Glamorous Toolkit is the one of SmaCC with which we define parsers for other langauges. For example, below we see the definition of the C# parser presented similarly to how we present Pharo code. Beside the editing abilities, the integration also comes with various debugging and inspection abilities, such as a simulator. Through these tools we make the construction and evolution of parsers innexpensive.
</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>The parser for C# expressed in SmaCC and a live simulator testing a given input</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
PetitParser2 is another parsing framework. A top-down one. This is a different parsing technology than SmaCC and it is particularly interesting for more casual parsers for discovering structure in what appears less …</p></div></div>

This is my opinion, and you're welcome to disagree with it. Don't advocate over-engineering without a purpose and don't spread bad advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my previous entry, <a href="https://0xff.nu/speed">Pursuing Speed</a>, I feel like even though I got my point across (I'd like to believe I did) I didn't articulate my thoughts in a sufficient manner.
In this addendum, I'd like to further elaborate about the state of the web.</p>
<p>In today's world -- a world of abundance and plenty, it's easy to get lost in the plethora of available resources and fast connections and become lazy and dependent on these resources, all while forgetting your craft and why is it you started doing whatever it is you're doing in the first place.</p>
<p>People like Colby Fayock saying <a href="https://www.colbyfayock.com/2020/07/youre-allowed-to-overengineer-your-blog/">you're allowed to over-engineer your blog</a> couldn't be more wrong (at least in the current phrasing), basically saying you can just do what-fucking-ever because it's educational for YOU.
While yes, you can use React, jQuery and whatever fucking library you wish to hone YOUR skills, dumping all these overkill libraries, frameworks, trackers and huge fucking images on your visitors is NOT okay.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-fuck-is-accessibility-even">What the fuck is accessibility, even?<a href="#what-the-fuck-is-accessibility-even"> <i></i></a></h2>
<p>What people like Colby Fayock are saying, is that websites like <a href="https://merichard123.github.io/">this</a> are okay. That it is, in essence, okay to force your visitors to load 1.6Mb of resources just to show them 1084b (yes, bytes) of relevant information (on the front page). That's 0.06%.</p>
<p><img src="https://0xff.nu/i/Tubby-ae0ddc24569cabab.png" alt="Holy fucking unreadable font, Batman!" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Somehow loading FontAwesome Brands font, an image with no added value and honestly an unreadable Google Font is more fucking important than adding a dark theme to your website, properly designing for mobile, or, you know, if you <strong>truly</strong> want to be hip, fucking researching about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API">Network Information API</a>.</p>
<h2 id="glorious-overkill">Glorious overkill<a href="#glorious-overkill"> <i></i></a></h2>
<p>Broken HTTPS cert aside, websites like <a href="https://cs.ambadiritik.tech/">this</a> are completely fucking useless if you can't (or don't want to) load JavaScript. So you know what? Fine, let's load JS.
What did we get? We're loading 256kb for this much fucking content:
<img src="https://0xff.nu/i/Cold-2a380d37a67d0e9c.png" alt="Image showing disproportionate content to page size" loading="lazy">
Fucking great. 622b of mostly irrelevant data. <strong>That's 0.24% of what you're actually fucking loading.</strong>
But hey, having a fucking shiny React website is more important, right? For personal development, yeah?</p>
<h2 id="i-can-t-even">I can't even<a href="#i-can-t-even"> <i></i></a></h2>
<p>As a last example, we have people like Miranda Limonczenko who preach about <a href="https://dev.to/mlimonczenko/why-clean-code-is-still-a-classic-3n3a">Clean Code</a> who's website is, ready for it? <strong>8 point fucking 3 megabytes large</strong>.
That's for the front fucking page. The <strong>entirety</strong> of Shakespeare's works only occupy about 5.6mb.</p>
<p><img src="https://0xff.nu/i/Real-d9294c8a9bce95b1.png" alt="20 seconds to load on Fast 3G" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>I'm not even going to talk about the fact SquareSpace is being used here. Or that it's ridden with trackers. Or that it would take me fucking 18 seconds to load this monstrosity with a Fast 3G connection just to see promotional garbage on the front page.</p>
<h2 id="over-engineering">Over-engineering<a href="#over-engineering"> <i></i></a></h2>
<p>Go on, listen to people like Colby, over-engineer ahead, shove 10 frameworks, 5 million libraries and all the fucking tracking scripts you want - at <strong>your own</strong> expense.
Your visitors are <strong>not</strong> your testing group. Their time is not free and nor is their data plan.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>LinkedIn profiles have become a powerful place to gather data on individuals. Different parties will have their own usage of LinkedIn profiles, such as LinkedIn data mining, profile research or leads generation.</blockquote><p>There are many methods out there to procure the information we need. In this tutorial, we’ll be using one of the more simple ways to obtain the data we need, which is to use <strong>Python</strong> to simulate a Google search and get ahold of the URLs returned from the search results. Further processing can be done, either manually or via automation, as we discuss in our other tutorial, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/tutorial-how-to-build-linkedin-automation-tools-with-python-with-a-code-example/">How to Build LinkedIn Automation Tools with Python With a Code Example</a>.</p><p>The main reason for this is to get familiar with one of the most common methods of web scraping, which is browser-based scraping. For those unfamiliar, this is where we simulate human behaviour on the web by using a browser. We will utilize a tool called <strong>Selenium</strong>, which is an open-source testing framework for web applications, which allows us to start a browser through the script. Its usage goes far beyond testing, however, as we will soon demonstrate.</p><h3 id="setup-">Setup:</h3><p>Before we start, we need to set up the project and download the dependencies we need:</p><ol><li>Python 3</li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/"><code>selenium library</code> with chrome webdriver</a></li></ol><h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3><p>Let’s simulate a Google search. We will be making use of one of the more unknown Google search features, which is Google search operators, also referred to as advanced operators. These are special characters and commands that help to provide a more strict criterion for our search term, hence narrowing down our search results. You can read <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">here</a> for a comprehensive list of operators.</p><pre><code>def create_search_url(title, location, *include):
    result = ""
    base_url = "http://www.google.com/search?q=+-intitle:%22profiles%22+site:linkedin.com/in/+OR+site:linkedin.com/pub/"

    quote = lambda x: "%22" + x + "%22"

    result += base_url
    result += quote(title) + "+" + quote(location)

    for word in include:
        result += "+" + quote(word)

    return result
</code></pre><p>We first start by defining our base URL. As you can see, there are search operators already present. The <code>-intitle</code> operator tells the engine to find pages with the word 'profiles' in the title tag. We also use the <code>-inurl</code> operator to ensure we only want pages with LinkedIn profile URLs. We can specify the default profile URLs that starts with <code>linkedin.com/pub/</code> or personalised URLs that start with <code>linkedin.com/in/</code> using the <code>OR</code> operator.</p><p>Then, we narrow our search even more by using double quotation marks to use exact-matching. Since we can’t enter double quotations in a Python string, we should either use the escape character (“\”) before the quotes or use the Unicode-equivalent in the URL which is <code>%22</code>. We enter the desired title/position and the country we passed as arguments into the quotes. To make our function less rigid, we allow additional arguments if you want to specify more criteria. Anything passed as <code>include</code> will be added for exact matching.</p><p>You can test this function yourself by printing out the result and pasting that result in your browser search bar. You can actually generate more specific Google search URLs by using free online tools like <a href="https://recruitin.net/">Recruit’em XRay Search</a>.</p><h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3><p>Now we will make use of Selenium’s WebDriver to spin up our own automated browser. We can use any of the browsers supported by Selenium (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, etc), but for now, we will use Chrome. Here we can also specify if we want to run this browser in headless mode, which is to say without the browser window popping up (no GUI), by adding <code>options.add_argument('headless')</code>.</p><pre><code>max_page = 5
all_urls = []

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
# options.add_argument('headless')

# specifies the path to the chromedriver.exe
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# always start from page 1
page = 1

driver.get(create_search_url("software engineer", "singapore", "developer", "nubela"))

while True:
    time.sleep(3)

    # find the urls
    urls = driver.find_elements_by_class_name('r')
    urls = [url.find_element_by_tag_name('a') for url in urls]
    urls = [url.get_attribute("href") for url in urls]
    all_urls = all_urls + urls

    # move to the next page
    page += 1

    if page &gt; max_page:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1))
        break

    try:
        next_page = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("a[aria-label='Page " + str(page) + "']")
        next_page.click()
    except:
        print('\n end at page:' + str(page - 1) + ' (last page)')
        break

print(all_urls)
</code></pre><p>We then navigate to the URL returned by the previous function using <code>driver.get()</code>. This will open the page on the browser. Then it's time to get our hands on the profile URLs that are on this page of Google. We can use the browser 'Inspect' developer tool to see the HTML tag of the page links. For every link on the page, the class name of the HTML <code>div</code> will be <code>r</code>. As per convention, the hyperlink, or the profile URL, will be embedded within the <code>hrefs</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> tag.</p><p>Every time we finish scraping the Google page for URLs, we navigate to the next page by finding the button using <code>driver.find_element_by_css_selector()</code> and simulating a click action. Here we specified a counter for the number of pages and a maximum page which you can set a reasonable number for. If the next page doesn't exist, then we stop our crawling and return our results.</p><h3 id="additional-steps">Additional steps</h3><p>You have now obtained the LinkedIn profile URLs that you need. Easy, right? All you have to do now is to gather data available on these profiles. Unfortunately, bulk web scraping LinkedIn itself won’t be this easy because LinkedIn has measures in place to prevent this from happening. Read our other article, <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-linkedin-automation-tools-using-your-own-account/">Why You Shouldn’t Use LinkedIn Automation Tools using YOUR OWN Account</a>, to understand that even using some LinkedIn automation tools might danger your LinkedIn account.</p><p><strong>Good news, you can now scrape LinkedIn profiles <em>WITHOUT</em> risking your account with <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/">Proxycurl</a>!</strong> You can read the <a href="https://nubela.co/blog/introducing-proxycurls-linkedin-api/">introduction to Proxycurl's LinkedIn API here</a>.

<![CDATA[Is Open Source Even Relevant in Serverless]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Open source has been intertwined with enterprise software for more than two decades and, with the increased adoption of cloud computing, the role of open-source software has only been increasing. If we look at the hype around containers, it is completely driven by open source. As <a href="https://talkingserverless.com/serverless/">Serverless</a> gains traction, driven mainly by the higher-level abstractions, the key question in the minds of industry watchers. When the underlying nuts and bolts have limited meaning from the point of view of its end users, does open source have any meaning? Do developers even care about open source?</p>



<p>When cloud computing gained traction, driven by the success of AWS, there were questions about the viability of open-source software. We had open source projects like OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, competing against the Infrastructure as a Service offering from AWS. They failed miserably because the advantage of cloud computing was in the outsourcing of data center capital expenditure and operations. Open-source IaaS software didn’t provide this advantage and all they could offer was better resource utilization and programmatic access to the infrastructure. However, in the early days of cloud computing, the public cloud was not a runaway success among enterprise customers and the hybrid cloud was the path taken by these users.</p>



<p>Even though open source failed in providing an equivalent to AWS EC2, we saw the reverse happening in the PaaS layer. While Heroku, Google App Engine stagnated after getting initial developer mindshare, OSS offerings like OpenShift and CloudFoundry gained developer traction as well as enterprise adoption. Their success could be adopted to the fact that enterprise customers wanted to have a PaaS like abstraction that could span both on-premises as well as public cloud. This was followed by the huge success of Docker as the container engine and Kubernetes as the container orchestration plane. At this point, talking heads were so confident about the importance of OSS in cloud computing. But we need to keep in mind that the success of OSS in the PaaS layer was driven by two main reasons:</p>



<ul><li>PaaS services in the public cloud had a legacy cost structure based on compute units similar to virtual machines</li><li>Hybrid cloud was still the focus of enterprise customers due to unnecessary concerns about moving to public cloud providers</li></ul>



<p>In the last 2-3 years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the enterprise adoption of public clouds and most organizations are taking a cloud-first approach.</p>



<p>So, when AWS released AWS Lambda with a new pricing model based on service invocations, we saw a shift similar in importance to what happened when they released compute and storage as a service with a pricing model where user paid only when the service was used. Functions as a Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda, <a href="https://go.zoho.com/yIl">Catalyst</a>, Azure Functions, etc. provide a breakthrough in the cost model similar to the pay per use model unleashed by early cloud services like AWS S3 and EC2. This is what makes FaaS uniquely attractive to both developers and enterprises. A fundamental shift in a cost structure that lowers the barrier to adoption and the cost of innovation. FaaS levels the playing field for smaller companies to build innovative services to compete with large organizations with great financial muscle. This is entirely driven by the cost model of FaaS alone and the cost savings are the reason why FaaS is still attractive in spite of certain architectural limitations imposed by the abstraction.</p>



<p>The key question is whether open-source can compete with FaaS offerings in the cloud. There is no straightforward binary answer and it is a bit more nuanced. OSS cannot compete head to head with FaaS. Developers would rather not have any operational overhead than managing the open-source serverless layer. FaaS is a clear winner against open source equivalents just like how IaaS made open-source cloud infrastructure software irrelevant. However, open-source may still be important in some niche areas:</p>



<ul><li>There could be higher-order developer frameworks on top of FaaS that could be open source in order to get developer mindshare. Serverless.com is a good example of this</li><li>Multi-cloud is fast becoming the de facto strategy for many organizations. Organizations may want to provide the same developer abstractions across multiple cloud providers. Open source serverless platforms will be relevant in this scenario. Data is spread out among multiple cloud providers and the compute for the applications using the data should lie closer to the data. Many organizations may want to provide a standardized developer interface to their developers. Open source serverless platforms will be useful in such scenarios. This is similar to the success of OpenShift and, to a lesser extent, CloudFoundry in the PaaS layer</li><li>Kubernetes is fast gaining traction among the enterprises for deploying containers. As organizations deploy apps using multiple encapsulations and deployment models like containers and FaaS, they may want to have a Kubernetes based serverless layer. Knative and serverless frameworks on top of Knative may be relevant in such scenarios</li></ul>



<p>While it doesn’t make sense to use an open-source FaaS layer while using a single cloud provider for deploying the applications, it may still be relevant in multi-cloud scenarios and toolkits around FaaS. Thoughts?</p>

        <p><span>We often see luminous flux or illumination data on the packaging of light bulbs or other lamps. Maybe you know these two parameters are used to describe the brightness of light. But what are the specific definitions of luminous flux and illumination? What's the difference between them?</span></p>
<h3><strong>What is Luminous Flux?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Luminous flux is a measure of the total amount of visible light emitted by a lamp. It's different from the radiant flux. Radiation flux is the measurement of all electromagnetic radiation emitted (including infrared, ultraviolet and visible), which is the total amount of objective light. Luminous flux is the amount of light that the human eye senses. It reflects the sensitivity of the human eye by weighting each wavelength with a luminosity function. So that it is the weighted sum of all wavelengths of power in the visible light band, excluding infrared and ultraviolet.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6401/files/F11_grande.jpg?v=1555568158" alt=""></span></p>
<h3><span><strong>What is the Luminosity Function? </strong></span></h3>
<p><span>The luminosity function describes the relative sensitivity of human eyes to light of different wavelengths by subjectively judging the brightness of light of different colors. It shouldnâ€™t be considered perfectly accurate, but it is a good representation of visual sensitivity of the human eye and it is valuable as a baseline for experimental purposes.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6401/files/F22_grande.png?v=1555568163" alt=""></span></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Photopic (black) and scotopic (green) luminosity functions</strong></p>
<h3>
<strong>The Unit of </strong><strong>Luminous Flux</strong><strong>â€”â€”<span>Lumen</span></strong>
</h3>
<p>TheÂ&nbsp;SIÂ&nbsp;unit of luminous flux is theÂ&nbsp;lumenÂ&nbsp;(lm). The lumen is defined in relation to theÂ&nbsp;candelaÂ&nbsp;which is the unit of luminous intensity as</p>
<p><em>1 lm = 1Â&nbsp;cdÂ&nbsp;</em><em>â‹…</em><em>Â&nbsp;sr</em></p>
<p><span>That is, when the luminous angle of a light source is one </span>solid angle<span> and the luminous flux is 1 lumen, its luminous intensity is 1 candela. When the luminous flux of a light source is also 1 lumen, but the luminous angle becomes 1/2 </span>solid angle<span>, the luminous intensity of this light source is considered to be 2 candelas. </span></p>
<p><span>Conversely, when the luminous intensity of a point light source that emits light in all directions is 1 candela, as a full sphere </span>has aÂ&nbsp;solid angleÂ&nbsp;of 4Ï€Â&nbsp;steradians<span>, the luminous flux of this light source is 4</span><span>Ï€ lumens, or 12.56 lumens.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6401/files/F33_large.png?v=1555568178" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: A graphical representation of 1 steradian.</strong></p>
<h3>
<strong>What is i</strong><strong>lluminance?</strong>
</h3>
<p>In photometry, illuminance is the total luminous flux of light incident per unit area. In other words, luminous flux represents the total amount of light emitted by the source, while illuminance refers to the total amount of light received by an object.</p>
<p>The relationship between illuminance and luminous flux is similar to that between Irradiance and <span>radiation flux</span>, that is, the radiation flux received per unit area. However, the illuminance is weighted according to the sensitivity of human eyes to light of different wavelengths, which represents the light intensity perceived by human eyes.</p>
<h3>
<strong>The Unit of </strong><strong>Illuminance</strong><strong>â€”â€”<span>Lux</span></strong>
</h3>
<p>TheÂ&nbsp;SIÂ&nbsp;unit of illuminance is the luxÂ&nbsp;(lx). It is equal to oneÂ&nbsp;lumenÂ&nbsp;per square meter.</p>
<p><em>1Â&nbsp;lxÂ&nbsp;= 1Â&nbsp;lm/m<sup>2</sup>Â&nbsp;= 1Â&nbsp;cdÂ·sr/m<sup>2</sup>.</em></p>
<p>In photography, there is also a non-metric unit of illumination, foot-candle. Foot-candle means "the illumination of a candle source on a surface one foot away." Thus, one foot-candle is equal to one lumen per square foot or about 10 lux.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0344/6401/files/F44_grande.jpg?v=1555568185" alt=""></p>
<h3>
<strong>Both Distance an</strong><strong>d Tilt affect</strong><strong> Illumination</strong>
</h3>
<p><span>Illuminance is the number of lumens per square meter. It means that when a light source of 1000 lumens illuminate an area of 1 square meter, the illuminance on this plane is 1000 lx. When a light source of 1000 lumens illuminate an area of 10 square meters, the illuminance on the plane becomes 100 lx. </span></p>
<p><span>So that, when we buy light bulbs, we should not just choose them based on the number of lumens. This is because when bulbs of same lumen number are installed in sitting room and toilet, as a result of the different size of rooms, the illuminance distinction that eyes perception can be greatly.</span></p>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>– It’s not natural.</p>



<p>– None of your ancestors ever needed it.</p>



<p> – It’s new, so there haven’t been any studies on the long-term risks.</p>



<p> – The rich will have more of it than the poor, which contributes to inequality.</p>



<p> – Whites will have more of it than blacks, which contributes to racism.</p>



<p> – The inventors might get rich, even though the world has many hard-working, poor people. That’s not fair.</p>



<p> – Someone who doesn’t want it might be pressured into using it, and that would impinge on personal freedom.</p>



<p> – If it doesn’t save labor, it’s frivolous; if it does save labor, it will put people out of work.</p>



<p> – What if criminals, dictators, or other bad actors used it for evil purposes?</p>



<p> – People are used to the old way of doing things, and why should they have to change?</p>



<p> – It needs to be tested more thoroughly.</p>



<p> – Not having to do things the hard way will make everyone lazy.</p>



<p> – It’s not perfect, and it won’t solve all of our problems.</p>



<p> – Nobody would really want it anyway.</p>



<p> – The whole idea is just ridiculous.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In more recent machine learning benchmark tests, such as <a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks">Linguistic Acceptability</a>, I started to see Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), instead of more traditional accuracy or F1 score, being used as an evaluation metric. This Matthews Correlation Coefficient sounds familiar to me because previously I studied crystallography and there is a <a href="http://www.ruppweb.org/mattprob/default.html">“Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities)”</a> in crystallography which estimates probabilities for the occurrence of (protein) multimerization states in crystal. So I was very curious to see whether the two Matthews are the same person, what the correlations between Matthews Correlation Coefficient and Matthews Coefficient is, why a correlation coefficient would be used as a classification metric, and how Matthews Correlation Coefficient was derived. Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</a> hardly mentioned any of these.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to present my shallow archaeological investigation on Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>

<h3 id="confusion-matrix">Confusion Matrix</h3>

<p>Matthews Correlation Coefficient is computed entirely based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a>. It is necessary to understand the confusion matrix before we talk about Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>This is the confusion matrix for binary classifications. I will also restrict the discussion of the topic in this blog post to binary classifications.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2" rowspan="2"></th>
    <th colspan="2">$\boldsymbol{S}$</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$1$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">$\boldsymbol{P}$</td>
    <td>$0$</td>
    <td>$TN$</td>
    <td>$FN$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$1$</td>
    <td>$FP$</td>
    <td>$TP$</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Where $\boldsymbol{S}$ is the label of the data, and $\boldsymbol{P}$ is the prediction of the data. $TN$ is “True Positives”, $FN$ is “False Negatives”, $FP$ is “False Positives”, and $TP$ is “True Positives”.</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-matthews-correlation-coefficient">Definition of Matthews Correlation Coefficient</h3>

<p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</a>, it sounds like that this magic correlation coefficient was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Matthews_(biochemist)">Brian Matthews</a> in the paper <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1180967">“Comparison of the predicted and observed secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme”</a> published in 1975.</p>



<p>The original form of the expression revised from the paper, as described on Wikipedia, are</p>



<h3 id="derivation-of-matthews-correlation-coefficient">Derivation of Matthews Correlation Coefficient</h3>

<p>Wikipedia never mentioned anything about how this coefficient was derived and why this expression is called as a “correlation coefficient”. So I looked into the paper.</p>



<p>In the paper, the author said the (Matthews) correlation coefficient was a special case for this correlation coefficient given by a book “Statistical Methods for Research Workers” authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>.</p>



<p>Where $S_n$ is the observation value (label) for sample $n$, $P_n$ is the predicted value (prediction) for sample $n$, $\bar{S}$ and $\bar{P}$ are the mean values of $S_n$ and $P_n$, respectively.</p>



<p>Wait, does this correlation coefficient look familiar? I immediately realized that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson Correlation Coefficient</a>, which is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables $X$ and $Y$! The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was developed in the 1800s which was way before Matthews Correlation Coefficient was born!</p>



<p>As a special case for Pearson Correlation Coefficient, in Matthews Correlation Coefficient, $S_n$ and $P_n$ could only be binary values $0$ and $1$, which is typical for classification problems. With this assumption, we could derive the original form of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>It might be a little bit brain-twisting, but we have the following facts from definition or slight math tricks.</p>



<p>We used the above facts to further derive the numerator and denominator.</p>



<p>For numerator,</p>



<p>For denominator,</p>



<p>Similarly, we could derive</p>



<p>Thus, the whole denominator is</p>



<p>Taken together, we have</p>



<h3 id="anecdote">Anecdote</h3>

<p>It turns out that Brian Matthews is the author for both “Matthews Correlation Coefficient” and “Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities)”. However, the physical meanings for these two are entirely different. People who do not study crystallography would probably never hear or use Matthews Coefficient (Probabilities).</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Matthews Correlation Coefficient is nothing special but applying Pearson Correlation Coefficient to binary classification problems where two random variables are prediction and label. That is to say, Matthews Correlation Coefficient is a discrete case for Pearson Correlation Coefficient.</p>



<p>When Pearson Correlation Coefficient or Matthews Correlation Coefficient is more close to 1.0, this means that more predictions match labels; When Pearson Correlation Coefficient is more close to -1.0, this means that more predictions disagree with labels; When Pearson Correlation Coefficient is more close to 0, this means that more predictions and labels do not have strong correlations, i.e., the predictions seem to be random.</p>



<p>I am very surprised that after so many years Pearson Correlation Coefficient was published, Pearson Correlation Coefficient was not used for binary classification problems until Brian Matthews’s work. If there are people who used Pearson Correlation Coefficient for binary classification problems, probably Matthews Correlation Coefficient has to change names.</p>
