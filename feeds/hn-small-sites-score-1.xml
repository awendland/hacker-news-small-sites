<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Generating APIs is becoming more and more popular. Especially the GraphQL community is "suffering" from this trend.
Production-ready APIs with authentication and caching in minutes, define the schema, and you're almost done.
As we all know, everything comes at a cost.
This post takes a critical look at generated GraphQL APIs, the benefits as well as the tradeoffs you're going to make.</p><h2>History and Trends<a href="#history-and-trends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generated GraphQL APIs look like a hot trend nowadays. Some venture backed companies push this topic hard to make it mainstream.
We hear praises of the amazing developer experience and how productive people are.
However, is this really a sustainable business?</p><p>If we look back a few years you might remember the term "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), established by companies like Parse.
The impact of parse, nowadays seems to be diminished. A lot of others jumped on the BaaS train, but except Firebase, you don't hear much on the topic nowadays.</p><p>Then came GraphQL and companies tried the same thing again.
If we look at the graveyard of failed companies you might find some familiar names like Reindex, Graphcool, etc...</p><p>Today, we have tools like Appsync and Hasura leading the pack, followed by many smaller companies who imitate them and try to diversify in various ways.</p><p>Appsync might be an outlier because their goal is not only BaaS but making AWS products easy to integrate, which is a different value proposition than their competition.</p><p>Another emerging trend is (Serverless) Databases as a Service.
dgraph offers a native GraphQL Database.
FaunaDB offers a Serverless Database which also comes with a GraphQL interface.
Then there's edgeDB which also offers a GraphQL interface.
I guess if you search for a while you'll find more.</p><p>Another quite popular category is Content Management Systems with GraphQL APIs.
The distinction from just BaaS is that these tools allow non-technical people to create content while developers can consume the content via GraphQL APIs.</p><p>How comes that the idea of BaaS/generated APIs keeps coming up while most of the implementations fail?</p><p>We might be able to look back in time to better understand why this approach is failing.
If you ask Prisma, the makers of Graphcool, they refer to this tweet:</p><blockquote><p>Exposing the database schema 1:1 via a generated graphql api totally misses the point of graphql - or an api as an intended abstraction.</p><p>-- <cite>Manuel Schoebel</cite></p></blockquote><p>We'll come back to this citation later.</p><h2>Developer experience of generated APIs<a href="#developer-experience-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One feature of generated APIs you cannot deny is the developer experience.
If you're an experienced Full-Stack developer you're able to start new projects in minutes.
Spin up a database, define the schema, API done. You're now able to start building the frontend.</p><p>Some of the services allow you to build the schema using a user interface only.
This allows even less experienced Frontend developers to build their own "APIs".
You click a few buttons and your API with authentication is ready to use.</p><p>But what about maintenance?
How do you evolve applications built using this approach?
What if you don't just have one API consumer?</p><p>Let's have a look at possible use cases.</p><h2>Use cases of generated APIs<a href="#use-cases-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generating APIs can be an amazing time-saver if you're a single developer, working on a small project.
You don't have to expose the API to other developers. It's just you using them.
You understand the tradeoffs, e.g. leaking some business logic into the client.
You're still happy because you saved a lot of time not having to build a backend.</p><p>Another good example where generated APIs can be very helpful is prototyping.
You want to bring an idea to life. You don't care about the quality of your API.
All you need is some CRUD methods to demonstrate an application to a prospect.</p><p>What about larger teams and projects? Are generated APIs also a good fit for enterprise use cases?</p><p>In order to answer this question, let's first have a look at what an API is.</p><h2>What is an API?<a href="#what-is-an-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I'll not go into much detail of this topic, as I want to stay focused.
If you're interested to learn more about what an API is, I can highly recommend Erik Wilde <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYeU2T4v2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talking about the topic</a>.</p><p>Too long, didn't watch:</p><p>An API is an interface, abstracting away an implementation of a contract.
In Eriks example, he explains how a weather forecast company exposes their forecasts through an API to other developers.</p><p>GraphQL is a Query language, offering one way of implementing APIs.</p><p>APIs make integrations scalable because we can rely on standards and don't have to understand every detail of a system.
E.g. if an API speaks GraphQL, clients know already how to interact with the system.
We can understand the API by issuing an introspection Query and from there on use the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema.</p><p>Without tools like GraphQL, we had to invent custom contracts and integration tooling for every API.</p><p>One important aspect of the success of an API is its design.
APIs must be able to cover common use cases of API consumers.
E.g. a weather API is useless if it's almost impossible to get forecasts for the next few days in a very easy way.</p><p>Next, we'll look into API design to further understand why generated APIs don't scale.</p><h2>On good API design<a href="#on-good-api-design" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going back to the weather forecast service, we talked about success factors of the API.
An API can also be seen as a product as it serves a specific purpose.</p><p>How can a weather forecast API be successful?
As with any other product, you have to talk to your users and adapt to their needs.
You have to re-shape your product to serve your customers well.</p><p>In case of an API, re-shaping means finding a good API design.</p><p>And with that, we're at the core of the problem of generated APIs.</p><p>It's impossible to design an API when all you do is deriving it from e.g. database tables.
A good API is not just making raw data accessible. A good API is driven by use cases, making it easy to integrate.
It doesn't have to be a public facing API. If you're providing an API to other developers it should be designed around their use-cases.
Deriving APIs from database schemas, tables or whatever it is means, you're not designing, you're not focussing on your users.</p><p>The consequences are well described by Erik:</p><blockquote><p>If you're designing an API by avoiding designing it, you end up with the design you deserve.</p><p>-- <cite>Erik Wilde</cite></p></blockquote><p>If you skip the design phase, you'll end up with unhappy users.
If your company depends on the success of your APIs, this could be a deal breaker.</p><p>Imagine you're an engineer and your task is to build a new steering wheel for a car.
You'll take the whole description of the CAN-BUS (internal communication system) description of the car and "generate" a panel of knobs from it.
This steering wheel might have thousands of buttons and is barely usable.</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out how people would want to steer a car?
What knobs they need on it to control the radio without losing control of the car?
Once you have figured out the requirements you could then start mocking a few designs.
With those designs you'd then go to users and test if they work they way you expect.
You'll then iterate your ideas until you find a good design.
Only then, you'll actually build a real steering wheel.
One that you're confident will solve the problem of your user.</p><p>What's different from a steering wheel and the API of your service?
Why is it not obvious that generated APIs don't solve the problem.</p><p>You'd be much faster generating a steering wheel because you don't have to spend time designing and implementing it.
If you're the only user of your steering wheel, this might work because you know all about CAN-BUS systems.
However, this approach won't scale if you want to build APIs for other teams and companies.</p><h2>Information hiding principle<a href="#information-hiding-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Another important aspect of APIs is abstraction and information hiding.</p><p>API consumers should not have to think about the implementation.
But what if the API is leaking implementation details?</p><p>Let's have a look at this simple example:</p><p>Even if the language is GraphQL, it's clear that we're talking to a relational database and SQL is used behind the scenes.</p><p>Should an API consumer have to think about primary keys? Isn't that a concern of storing data, a completely different layer?</p><p>How about JSON selectors as arguments?</p><p>Isn't the implementation leaking information on how data is being stored?</p><p>Here's another example where GraphQL is being abused as an ORM.</p><p>The consequence of these examples is that it's almost impossible to make changes to the implementation.</p><p>Developers who know some basics on databases might see another problem with this approach.
In case of complex WHERE clauses (hello SQL) or aggregations, you have to make sure that the required indices exist on the database.
Otherwise, you'll run into full table scan problems.</p><p>I think it's clear that all these examples violate the principle of information hiding.</p><h2>Implementing APIs<a href="#implementing-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In the very beginning, we were looking at the developer experience of generated APIs and how much time you can save by not implementing the API but generating it.
We then learned that generated APIs generally don't scale well beyond personal projects because they are not driven by use cases.</p><p>Now, let's have a look at what actually makes a good API implementation.</p><p>A good API implementation decouples the API contract from data storage and other aspects like e.g. authentication.
A good API implementation allows you to change how you store data without breaking the API contract.
A good API also allows you to easily evolve and extend the contract for new use cases.
These three requirements are impossible to accomplish with generated APIs that are tightly coupled to infrastructure.</p><p>But there's one additional component that tops all of them: Business logic or state machines.
A good API doesn't force API consumers to implement their own state machine to interpret the data of the API.
Forcing API consumers to interpret raw data and derive state is prone to errors and should be avoided.</p><p>Let's have a closer look at state machines.</p><h2>State …</h2></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J.

<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>

<p>Of this third group, people rated the cheap wine a 60.0 and the expensive wine a 58.5.

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al.

<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine. Of the 346 people, 170 people (49.1%) preferred the regular wine and 176 (50.9%) preferred the reserve—rates that are virtually the same as picking one of the wines at random (50.0%).<span id="easy-footnote-7-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-65224613" title="Weil, R.L.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

			<p><span>T</span>his past summer, my wife and I ventured to an area near Mount Adams in southwestern Washington state to census bumblebees. We camped there over the weekend as we took part in the Pacific Northwest Bumblebee Atlas survey. Scientists want to fill gaps in their knowledge about the bees. Learning about the relative number of different species, and their floral resources over a broad area, provides invaluable information, particularly when some species are in decline. I was helping to determine where conservation efforts may be needed. Survey participants choose a territory where they capture and photograph bumblebees on two occasions. I still marvel at the variety in the photos we took—bees with coloration incorporating rusty bands of hair, black stubby hairs, white patches, orange bands, and a brilliant, lemon-yellow covering of long hairs. <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/the-fungal-evangelist-who-would-save-the-bees" target="_blank">Bumblebees</a> are really quite beautiful when observed more closely.</p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18113_ca9eac0c76de0cab71d5b50951fe4c5f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>FIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE:</strong> A 2017 global study found that one-third of assessed bumblebee species were in decline. The U.S. is studying whether to place the western bumblebee on the endangered species list.</span><span>Stephen Ausmus, USDA ARS / Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is some risk involved, of course. Bumblebees have a painful sting and, unlike the honeybee, with its barbed stinger, the sharp, smooth bumblebee stinger can sting multiple times. Insect stings may serve two purposes. The first is to incapacitate prey. The second is to ward off predators. Bumblebees feed solely on pollen and flower nectar. So they would not sting to subdue prey. A bumblebee nest full of honey and nearly immobile larvae, though, is highly attractive to predators. The bumblebee sting is a weapon used for defense—a mechanism to escape predation from animals that may be 50,000 to 100,000 times their size.<sup>1</sup> And judging by the way most people respond, it works pretty well. The sting of the honeybee has been used as a reference point by sting pain connoisseur, Justin Schmidt. He rates the bumblebee and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/3/in-transit/tracking-honeybees-to-save-them" target="_blank">honeybee</a> stings as a pedestrian 2 on his scale of 1-4.<sup>2</sup> But that’s a sufficient wallop for people to keep their distance from these bees—and that’s the way the bees like it.<br></p><p>The unparalleled success of insects as a group of organisms results from their ability to escape existential threats. They’re escape artists. They’ve evolved multiple means of eluding the larger animals that endanger them—by stinging, biting, flying, jumping, running, startling, hiding in crevices, and using camouflage as well as chemical defenses. Yet these masters at evading far larger animals face a threat more pernicious than predation today. The resulting decline in the number of insects and in the number of insect species is increasingly well documented. Why should this be alarming? Insects play significant roles as food or in the growth of food for many organisms, including human beings. Insects are also recyclers, decomposing plant matter and animal dung and contributing to the organic content of soils.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not all honey and butterflies in our relationship with insects.</p> </blockquote><p>It’s been said that if human beings disappeared, we would not be missed. Insects and other organisms would thrive. Yet we and many other animals <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/73/play/we-need-insects-more-than-they-need-us" target="_blank">would not survive were insects to disappear</a>. The plight of the island marble butterfly (<i>Euchloe ausonides insulanis</i>) and the western bumblebee (<i>Bombus occidentalis</i>) exemplify the multiple stressors on insect survival in the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/dawn-of-the-heliocene" target="_blank">Anthropocene</a>, the proposed name for a new epoch in which human-generated change outstrips the effect of natural forces on the Earth. What responsibilities, if any, do we bear toward these insects? And what can each of us do to stem the tide of global insect decline?<br></p><p>In my recent book, <i>Nature Underfoot</i>, I argue that we crush, poison, and destroy insects and their habitat at our own peril. Yet reasons for acting to prevent insect decline run much deeper than self-interest. Humans cause habitat loss, produce pesticides, and import non-native species. We bear, according to certain strands of philosophical and religious thought, responsibility for the catastrophic losses insects experience today. Some say that insects have moral value since they strive to achieve their ends, just as we and other animals do. Others argue that insects have <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">moral value as a part of God’s creation</a>. Scientists point to the value of insects in global ecosystems, or the value implied by tens or hundreds of thousands of years involved in the evolution of an insect species.</p><p><span>T</span>he insect apocalypse has captured headlines, but the situation is more nuanced than that. Scientists find an increase in the overall numbers of arthropods in the Arctic, but a decline in diversity. Certain habitats in the Arctic are also affected more than others.<sup>3</sup> In Puerto Rico, insect declines initially attributed to climate change may have resulted instead from hurricanes.<sup>4</sup> Some insect species have even increased in numbers—mainly those that are tolerant of human activities or that benefit from associating with humans or from <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/78/atmospheres/is-net-zero-emissions-an-impossible-goal" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</p><p>Despite that, the general trend is negative as climate change, habitat destruction (in the form of deforestation, urbanization, and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/herbicide-is-whats-for-dinner" target="_blank">intensification of agriculture</a>), and pesticides take their toll. These forces are overtaking the insects. They are coming so quickly that even these spectacularly successful evolutionary improvisers do not have time to escape. It’s often difficult for scientists to identify a single contributing factor. A new paper, introducing a special issue on the plight of insects, published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, referred to the decline of these tiny creatures as “death by a thousand cuts.”<sup>5</sup></p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18112_d05c25e6e6c5d4898161e0aaf700d9c7.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><strong>EDGE OF EXTINCTION:</strong> The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger its prairie habitats remain.</figcaption></figure><p>There is a paucity of long-term records for insect populations. The best historical records are for moths and butterflies in Europe and North America. The story of the island marble butterfly, a grassland species, illustrates the myriad forces arrayed against insects. It was declared endangered in the United States in May of 2020. It is charmingly small—mostly white on the tops of the wings and mottled green, yellow, and white on the undersides. Perhaps its colorful camouflage is a way of escaping predation. This little butterfly was thought to be extinct since 1908, when it was last collected on Gabriola Island, British Columbia. Quite by accident 90 years later, while conducting a survey of butterflies in Puget Sound prairie habitats, a Washington state biologist, John Fleckenstein, collected two of these butterflies on San Juan Island. Neither Fleckenstein, nor his colleague, Ann Potter, could identify the butterflies as they reviewed his collection. So, Potter took the butterflies to a butterfly conference in Corvallis, Oregon, where experts were ecstatic to see the butterfly once thought extinct!<sup>6</sup><br></p><p>The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger it remain. The prairie habitats where the butterfly is found have been farmed, used for pasture, and developed for housing, destroying much of its original habitat. The butterfly caterpillars feed and develop on plants in the mustard family. The native mustard, Menzies’ pepperweed (<i>Lepidium virginicum</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>), that must have originally supported the butterfly, is often found surrounding lagoons on San Juan Island. These plants and the island marble butterfly are damaged by winter storm surges, which will become more serious as climate change causes sea levels to rise. Fortunately, the butterfly has adapted to feeding on two non-native plants, field mustard (<i>Brassica rapa</i>) and tumble mustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>) that grow elsewhere on the island.</p><blockquote><p>We and many animals wouldn’t survive if insects disappeared.</p> </blockquote><p>Other invasive species have had a more deleterious effect on the island marble butterfly. The brown garden snail (<i>Cornu aspersum</i>), brought from Europe to the west coast as a source of escargot, competes with the island marble butterfly in consuming field mustard and tumble mustard. The European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) develops large populations in the San Juan Islands and also feeds on butterfly host plants. Deer, though native in the San Juans, are destructive of prairie habitat. Deer numbers are very high there because their predators, such as wolves, cougars, and bears, were eliminated by European settlers. Deer not only destroy island marble butterfly habitat, but they may ingest eggs and caterpillars in the process. Island marble butterflies also suffer from predation by native spiders and by a European paper wasp (<i>Polistes dominula</i>).<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>A vigorous and widely distributed population of butterflies could withstand the <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/fear-is-good-for-the-forest" target="_blank">pressure of predation</a>, but it poses a significant risk for the tiny, localized population of island marble butterflies. Death by a thousand cuts. Habitat destruction, loss of food plants, invasive species, climate change, and predation are primarily human-driven problems. Fortunately, what is believed to be the last island marble butterfly population falls within the boundaries of the San Juan National Historic Park. Here, the park service is actively rearing and releasing butterflies and making a significant effort to preserve their habitat. The island marble butterfly is in a fragile state but hopefully its new endangered status will yield another amazing recovery.</p><div>

<img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/qtanim2.gif" width="174" height="145" alt="(Animation) Ban the Drawer">
As part of their effort to mimic the appearance of the hand-held consumer device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> employed "drawer-like" interface elements.  The most notable of these, and unquestionably the single biggest blunder in the design of the application (other than attempting to mimic a physical device) is the <strong>Favorites Drawer</strong>.  The Favorites Drawer is intended to provide the user rapid access to his or her favorite multimedia files.  By that concept alone, it <i>should</i> be a useful interface feature.  Unfortunately, by virtue of attempting to mimic real-world devices, and due to a complete lack of familiarity with basic design principles, the Favorites Drawer in <i>QuickTime</i> is a dismal failure.
<p>The designers provided a smooth animation to give the appearance of the drawer opening at the bottom of the device, much like, one supposes, a panel might open on a hand-held device, and very much like the phone number "drawer" used in IBM's <a href="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/phone.html"><i>RealPhone</i></a>.  The drawer demonstrates one distinct problem of translating real-world phenomena to the computer desktop: <strong>real-world phenomena are not subject to the constraints of screen size</strong>.  The extent to which the drawer can "open", and therefore the number of items visible in the drawer, is a function of where the player is located in relation to the bottom of the screen.  If you want to hold more than a few items in the drawer, you'll have to first position the player near the top of the screen.  If you want to hold a lot of items in the drawer, you'll have to increase the resolution of your monitor.  If the player is positioned too close to the bottom of the screen, the drawer will simply not open.
Similarly, the current size of the player can interfere with the user's ability to access items in the Favorites Drawer; if the size of the player is increased, there is less screen real estate into which the drawer can open and therefore, fewer items in the drawer are accessible.  These problems would not exist if the designers had employed a standard pop-up window to contain the user's favorites.  These problems are the direct, expected results of dogmatic adherence to a faulty design philosophy.  By restricting themselves to the real-world metaphor, and not availing themselves of the dynamic features that computers provide, the designers needlessly restricted the utility and usability of the software.
</p><center><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/favs.gif" width="347" height="193" alt="Could not have been made any worse"></center>
<p>A look at the arrangement of items in the drawers demonstrates another fundamental problem with the translation of physical devices to software.  The favorites are arranged in a matrix, the number of elements of which is limited by the size of the screen.  A physical item is limited by its physical size.  A virtual item, such as a list of phone-numbers or favorites, is limited only by the amount of computer memory.  If the designers had provided a standard list box there would be virtually no limit to the number of favorites that a user could maintain.  Furthermore, by availing themselves of other standard GUI elements, the designers could have provided a great deal of additional functionality such as organizing favorites by whatever constructs the user wishes to employ, or creating a PlayList of items to be played successively.  Computer software is the ideal platform on which to offer such functionality, but because of their adherence to the physical device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i>, like other RealThings apologists, have made their software woefully inept in an area in which it should greatly excel.
</p><p>The images in the Favorites Drawer, despite their appearance, are not entirely meaningless.  The <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> assigns an image to those items that represent <strong>sound</strong> files.  All sound files however, will be assigned the <strong>same image</strong>, and the program provides no means by which the user can substitute a meaningful image.  On the other hand, the image used to represent a given movie is a thumbnail image of the first frame of the movie.  On the surface, this may seem appropriate, until one looks at a collection of movies: most of the movies we downloaded, especially those from Apple, begin with a <strong>blank, black screen</strong>.  The first frame of the remainining movies constituted a copyright notice which is especially unrecognizeable when reduced to thumbnail size. <strong>What were they thinking?</strong>
</p><p>The images in the drawer indicate little more than the fact that the drawer contains items.  For some completely inexplicable reason, the designers did not feel that it was important to display a title or other description of the item itself, nor did the designers provide any secondary means in the drawer itself, such as tooltips, balloon help, or a message in a status bar to distinguish various titles.  This is not a result of the inappropriate application of a real-world metaphor; this is simply pitiful design.  Balloon Help would certainly help the user,  but it would still require the user to pass the cursor over each image until the desired target could be located.  Since Balloon Help requires intervention of the user to be effective, it should be regarded as little more than a quick fix and not a substitute for an appropriate design of the Favorites function.
</p><p>The lack of meaningful descriptions for the items forces the user to rely on the physical position of the item in the matrix.  Unfortunately, if the user resizes the player window, the number of images in each row of the drawer may or may not change. The end result is that the user can no longer rely on image position as an aid to identification.  An item that was the third row from the bottom, might, after resizing, appear in the second row.  Because of the lack of labels and reliable positioning information, selecting a particular movie or sound file from the favorites drawer is not unlike trying to find a caramel-filled chocolate from a sampler box of chocolates.   As expressed by Forest Gump in the movie bearing his name:
</p><center><p><strong><em>
Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates,<br>
you never know what you are going to get.</em></strong>
</p></center>
<p>The only reliable means of finding a particular type of chocolate is to either bite into each, or at least press your thumb into the bottom of each and hope that nobody notices later.  Similarly, the only reliable means with which the user can identify a file of choice in the favorites drawer is to open several until he or she <em>happens upon</em> the file of interest.  If the designers had been concerned with the users' objectives at this point of the interaction with the <em>QuickTime 4.0 Player</em>, specifically, the ability to rapidly locate and open a particular file of interest, the favorites drawer would never have seen the light of day.  Unfortunately, the designers were far more interested in form over function, where "looking good" is considered more important than working well.
</p><p><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/orgfav.gif" width="257" height="198" alt="An old standby to the rescue">The application does provide additional means to determine the names of one's favorite media files, but the user must <strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  The application's menu bar offers a function labelled "Organize Favorites", which when selected provides a <strong>standard listbox</strong> containing the names of the favorites.  The listbox allows the user to rename favorites, delete favorites from the list, and reorder items in the list; these functions are notably unavailable from the Favorites Drawer itself.  The Organize Favorites dialog is not without its own design problems.  Surprisingly, the Organize Favorites dialog does not allow the user to Add favorites to the list, for that, the user has to ...<strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  Items in the list can be reordered, but no indication is provided that this is possible.  Further, as an example of a failure to pay attention in <strong>GUI 101</strong>, the designers do not allow the user to make multiple selections in the listbox; you cannot delete more than one item at a time, nor move more than one item at a time.  (Additional design inadequacies of the dialog are discussed below).
</p><p>Those limitations aside, all the designers need to do is add the ability to launch a favorite from the Organize Favorites dialog, change the title of the dialog to "Favorites", and burn the source code for the drawer. In so doing, they will exponentially improve the utility and usability of the Favorites function.  Then, after the designers complete <strong>GUI 201</strong>, they might want to provide the user the ability to <strong>organize the favorites</strong> into categories, <strong>export groups</strong> of favorites to share with others, add the ability to <strong>create a playlist</strong>, and open a favorite in a <strong>new window</strong>.  When you are dealing with a computer and not a real-world physical device just about anything is possible.

Typically we assume that if we get more things done each day, we’re highly productive. But the assumption couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.</p><p>When we think of someone productive, a friend or colleague, we tend to picture someone “busy” pushing through those tasks ticking them off one by one, trapped under an ever-growing pile of work. </p><p>It’s easy to think that busy people with a lot of output are productive, but the actual work they produce might be of little use. Being busy with many tasks, work-responsibilities, and long working hours does not mean that you are productive.</p><p>To become more productive, focus on the tasks that bring you closer to your goals, and consistently do so. Not everything is essential. No matter what you’re working on, there are tasks that you shouldn’t do or delegate, and only a few that are truly important.</p><p><strong>James Clear</strong>, the author of bestseller Atomic Habits, puts it in this way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum on everything.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong>, author and productivity guru, says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>“Productivity is when you focus on relevant output, getting the right things done. Things that improve your career, business, organization.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-does-productivity-mean-to-you">What does productivity mean to you?</h2><p>Before you put your head down and start thinking about becoming more productive, think about “why” you have this urge, what’s driving you. A standard answer that you might think of is; having more free time to do the things you enjoy doing. </p><p>If you can do more with less, surely you can reach your goals sooner, leaving you with time to focus on other goals in life. Is it a career goal you have, more time to read books, more time with your family or friends? Having clarity around what’s driving your actions will help you when things get tough.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-increasing-personal-productivity">What are the benefits of increasing personal productivity?</h2><p>We all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to each of us to determine how we want to use those hours. Productive people get more done with less effort, allowing them to focus on what was driving them in the first place. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.”</span> - <a href="https://ctt.ac/O20ad">Tweet this</a></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are clear benefits of improving your personal productivity, focus on the tasks with the most impact, the right things, and you’ll achieve more, and get better results.</p><p>Other benefits can be:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>When you become more organized and start to achieve your most impactful tasks on time, you will feel less stressed. Instead of running around trying to accomplish everything, you can focus on what matters the most. Your personal well-being increases, e.g., you feel happy and comfortable.</li><li><strong>Increase Engagement</strong><br>Increased productivity and engagement are closely related to each other. More productive people are usually also more passionate and engaged in the work they do. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more">Harvard Business Review</a> pointed out that higher engagement leads to a 22% increase in productivity. </li><li><strong>Improve self-confidence</strong><br>Improving productivity also allows you to learn more in less time. And, when you get better at what you do, you’ll also increase your confidence. In other words, productive people will learn more, get better at what they do, and become more self-confident.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-become-more-productive">How to become more productive</h2><p>As highlighted earlier in this article, it’s a significant difference between “movement” and “achievement.” Checking off tasks will allow you to feel more accomplished, but it won’t ensure that you move closer to your goals. Whatever strategy or technique you go with, and there are plenty to choose from, the most important thing to remember is to go with the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Like everything else in life, to make a change, it requires time and focus. So you need to look for a strategy that you can stick with and create a habit around.</p><p>To get you started, <strong>here are some of the most common and practical productivity strategies:</strong></p><h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">The Pomodoro Method</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most known and researched methods out there, and for a good reason, it’s simple and it works. This method can help you keep focus by getting things done in shorter bursts. </p><p>In-between, you take frequent breaks that can either be short or long, depending on how many tasks you’ve completed. You don’t need any particular tools to get started, all you need is a timer. In short, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Start on a task that you want to accomplish</li><li>Set the timer on 25 minutes (This block is referred to as the “Pomodoro”)</li><li>Work on the task until the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper</li><li>Take a 5-minutes break</li><li>After completing 4 “Pomodoros” take a 15-20 minutes break</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this popular technique is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, allowing you to keep focused and not give in to distractions. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/">Learn more about the Pomodoro Method.</a> </p><h2 id="eat-that-frog-method">Eat That Frog Method</h2><p>Mark Twain once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Applied to the real world, the “frog” would symbolize the most impactful and essential task you have to complete on a given day, week, or month. </p><p>If you eat that frog in the morning, or when you are the most productive, then you’ll get more done. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Learn more about the Eat that Frog method.</a></p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h2><p>Former President and five-star general, Dwight Eisenhower, had an extraordinary capability of being productive for more extended periods. One of his most essential productivity strategies is called the Eisenhower Matrix (or Box), and it’s a simple decision-making tool that you can easily incorporate in your daily routines. </p><p>The matrix labels tasks, depending on their level of importance and urgency. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/">how to use the Eisenhower Matrix in this article.</a></p><h2 id="focus-on-one-thing">Focus on ONE thing</h2><p>A productive person doesn’t necessarily do more work, they focus their work on the right things. And If you then focus your energy on “one” right thing after the other, you’ll accomplish more, and you’re likely to achieve your goals quicker. </p><p>This is, however, not just about focusing on one thing in your life period. It’s about being critical of what you choose to focus your energy on, where you have the most impact, and eliminate waste. Hone in on what matters and let go of everything else. This technique is not as simple as it may sound, but if you learn to master it, you can achieve almost anything. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">how focusing on one thing can help you.</a></p><h2 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h2><p>This 100-years old, 15-minutes method has been used by many professionals to increase their productivity. Why does it work? It’s dead simple. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>At the end of each day, write down the six most important tasks that you need to complete the following day. Not more than six.</li><li>Prioritize and stack rank these tasks in order of importance</li><li>Next day, start with your most important task and don’t more to the next task until you’ve completed the first one.</li><li>Work through the list of the tasks in the prioritized order. If you have unfinished tasks from one day, move them over to the new list next for the next day.</li><li>Every day you rinse and repeat this process. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/">Learn more about The Ivy Lee method, and how it can help you. </a></li></ul><h2 id="the-15-minute-anthony-trollope-routine">The 15-Minute Anthony Trollope Routine</h2><div><p>How did Anthony Trollope, a prolific English novelist and civil servant of the Victorian era, manage to write 47 novels, an autobiography, 2 plays, short stories, travel books, and countless of articles? </p><p>How can you possibly do all that while also maintaining a career at the Post Office as well? The answer lies within the system he setup for himself, a routine better knows as the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-15-minute-anthony-trollope-routine/">15-minute Anthony Trollope routine</a>. &nbsp;</p></div><h2 id="other-more-simple-techniques-to-try">Other more simple techniques to try</h2><p>Experts in this field have a tendency to overcomplicate things.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1
❯ ls -alh
Permissions Size User     Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--   167 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  control.ts
.rw-r--r--   183 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  info.json
drwxr-xr-x     - cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  node_modules

.rw-r--r--   35k cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  yarn.lock</code></pre>
 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",
  "install_mod": "run-s clean:install copy:install",
  "watch": "chokidar …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  		<p><span>I spent a significant amount of my career in the role of a dedicated testing specialist. I worked at Microsoft leading a variety of cross-company initiatives when we had 10,000 testers at the company. We worked closely with development teams and, at the time, made a difference in product quality. For most of that time, developers generally did a small bit of testing, but our test teams performed the vast majority of all testing efforts, including extensive suites of verification tests enhanced with a flurry of diagnostic tools and a healthy dose of exploratory testing and investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Somewhere in my tester journey, Microsoft moved from a mix of testers with and without programming experience to a model where all testers knew how to program, and I was a fly on the wall when we came up with the title for the infamous <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2018/11/06/the-software-engineer-in-test/">SDET</a> role. There were many good (and some not so good) reasons for this move that are outside the focus of this post. One thing I remember from some folks opposed to the move was a notion that testers who knew how to program could not do effective testing because they were “skewed” by their understanding of how the code works. The feeling of these people was that the testing mindset is separate from the developer mindset 🧠 – that if you had one, you couldn’t have the other.</span></p>
<p><span>My experiences showed a different story. While I certainly ran across testers who tried too hard to solve every testing challenge with code, most readily and easily took on the role of tester and did deep exploration and investigation in order to understand and evaluate risk. Often, as expected, they would write programs or utilities to accelerate their testing. Their programming skills didn’t </span><i><span>hurt</span></i><span> their testing – their programming skills </span><i><span>enhanced</span></i><span> their testing. The idea of a skewed mindset was a myth.</span></p>
<p><span>For the last several years, I’ve been working on teams without dedicated testers. While these teams often have a few folks (including myself) who have some responsibility for helping the development team do better testing, the developers are responsible for fully testing their code – not just for functional correctness, but for all aspects of quality.</span></p>
<p><span>A few people have stated to me recently that developers are unable to perform testing because “they lack the mindset for skilled testing”. This statement – like the statement I heard many years ago about skewed mindsets is flawed and incorrect.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mindsets and Skill Sets</strong></h2>
<p><span>Some voices in software development believe that building a product demands a certain mindset, while testing it demands a different mindset.</span></p>
<p><span>The book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322"><i><span>Mindset</span></i></a><span> by Carol S. Dweck says that mindset shapes how you learn and relate to others – and states that you have one of two mindsets – a </span><i><span>fixed</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe your abilities are unchangeable, and a </span><i><span>growth</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe the abilities you’re born with are a starting point for learning and advancing.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> coined the term, </span><i><span>knowledge work</span></i><span> to differentiate work that requires problem-solving and critical thinking from rote factory work. Authors such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717">Daniel Pink</a> (</span><i><span>A Whole New Mind</span></i><span>) have elaborated on the impact of creative thinking in knowledge workers.</span></p>
<p><span>Software development and software testing are knowledge work. Both require multiple skillsets, constant learning, and problem-solving. While developing and testing software may require different problem-solving approaches or skill sets, they are both part of </span><i><span>the same (growth) mindset</span></i><span>, and the best people I know in software can switch between their development/builder and tester/investigator </span><i><span>skill sets </span></i><span>rapidly and fluidly. While I agree that it’s not </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> – with <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/14/habits-plus-deliberate-practice-equals-mastery/">deliberate and frequent practice</a> shifting between these skill sets, most knowledge workers I’ve worked with can – and have become quite successful in developing this flow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Creators Skill Set&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span>I studied music composition as both an undergraduate and graduate student 🎶 Like building applications and writing, composition requires creation, bound by rules – which are sometimes intentionally broken in order to achieve the creator’s intent – as well as deep analysis and evaluation. As a composer, I constantly had to switch from putting notes on the page to looking at the passage or entire piece as a whole to make sure it achieved my intent. This analysis ranged from verifying notes and voicing were correct to examining every nuance of dynamics and orchestration. Like all metaphors, this one breaks down at some point, but composition skills require both creative (builder) and analysis skill sets (I took multiple courses in each), and the act of composition includes ample amounts of both.</span></p>
<p><span>For most of the last decade, I’ve spent a significant amount of my time helping developers expand their testing knowledge. I’ve watched hundreds of developers grow their knowledge about testing, and then almost immediately apply what they have learned. To be fair, I’ve also seen them make many of the same mistakes that new testers also make, but they’re eager to learn and constantly adjust. Many of these developers are at least as good at <a href="https://testproject.io/">testing</a> as the best testers I know. With no prompting or mindset shifts, most find a way to fluidly shift from the microscope view to the 10,000-foot view and back again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I’ve found in nearly every case is that initially, developers lack the skill sets that experienced testers have mastered. I’ve also seen that developers are completely capable of learning a wide variety of deep testing and investigation skills. I’ve also found that teams where developers have testing skills deliver more quickly, more predictably, and with higher quality.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Making the Shift</strong></h2>
<p><span>I’m not advocating for any software team to eliminate the testing role (although I believe testing expertise is much more suited embedded into the team than in a dedicated test team). But I am firmly against the idea that developers <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/12/09/quality-assurance-is-everyones-responsibility/">shouldn’t do testing</a> or can’t be good testers. I’ve proved that myth wrong dozens if not hundreds of times and colleagues in the industry have shared at least as many examples. <strong>Developers are </strong></span><strong><i>capable</i> of testing, can do testing and we should <i>expect</i></strong><span><strong> them to do testing</strong>. The expert testers of today would be well served by helping them learn and improve these skills.</span></p>
<p><span>We can start by recognizing that we’re all knowledge workers and that a big part of our job satisfaction and growth comes from learning and taking on harder and more challenging tasks. We should also recognize that software development requires a variety of unique skills</span><span>, but not a change in mindset. <strong>We don’t all have to master every skill, but learning, growth, and skill development is something we all can do</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>We just have to put our minds to it 😉</span></p>

      The Duck Hunt gun, officially called the NES Zapper, seems downright primitive next to today’s technology. But in the late ’80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder.</p>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

<p>His name was William James Sidis, and his IQ was estimated at between 250 and 300 [8, p. 283]. At eighteen months he could read The New York Times, at two he taught himself Latin, at three he learned Greek. By the time he was an adult he could speak more than forty languages and dialects. He gained entrance to Harvard at eleven, and gave a lecture on four-dimensional bodies to the Harvard Mathematical Club his first year. He graduated cum laude at sixteen, and became the youngest professor in history. He deduced the possibility of black holes more than twenty years before Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar published An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure. His life held possibilities for achievement that few people can imagine. Of all the prodigies for which there are records, his was probably the most powerful intellect of all. And yet it all came to nothing. He soon gave up his position as a professor, and for the rest of his life wandered from one menial job to another. His experiences as a child prodigy had proven so painful that he decided for the rest of his life to shun public exposure at all costs. Henceforth, he denied his gifts, refused to think about mathematics, and above all refused to perform as he had been made to do as a child. Instead, he devoted his intellect almost exclusively to the collection of streetcar transfers, and to the study of the history of his native Boston. He worked hard at becoming a normal human being, but never entirely succeeded. He found the concept of beauty, for example, to be completely incomprehensible, and the idea of sex repelled him. At fifteen he took a vow of celibacy, which he apparently kept for the remainder of his life, dying a virgin at the age of 46. He wore a vest summer and winter, and never learned to bathe regularly. A comment that Aldous Huxley once made about Sir Isaac Newton might equally have been said of Sidis.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the price Newton had to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb [5, p. 2222].</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a time when all precocious children were thought to burn out the same way that Sidis did. The man most responsible for changing this belief was Lewis M. Terman. Between 1900 and 1920 he was able to carry out a study of about a hundred gifted children, and his observations convinced him that many of the traditional beliefs about the gifted were little more than superstitions. To confirm these observations, he obtained a grant from the Commonwealth Fund in 1922, and used it to sift a population of more than a quarter of a million children, selecting out all those with IQs above 140 for further study. That group has been monitored continuously ever since. Many of the previously held beliefs about the gifted did indeed turn out to be false. The gifted are not weak or sickly, and although the incidence of myopia is greater among them, they are generally thought to be better looking than their contemporaries: They are not nerds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his rush to dispel the erroneous beliefs about the gifted, Terman sometimes made claims not supported by his own data. In fact, in some cases, the data suggests that exactly the opposite conclusion should have been drawn. Terman’s own data shows that there is a definite connection between measured intelligence and mental and social maladjustment. The consequences of misinterpreting these data are so grave that it will pay to re-examine them in some detail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422152937im_/http://216.224.180.96/~prom/oldsite/images/gof/terman.jpg" width="294" height="466"></p>
<p>Terman’s longitudinal research on the gifted included a constant assessment of mental health and social adjustment. Subjects were classified into three categories: satisfactory adjustment, some maladjustment, and serious maladjustment. Terman defined these categories in the following way.</p>
<p>1. Satisfactory. Subjects classified in this category were essentially normal; i.e., their “desires, emotions, and interests were compatible with the social standards and pressures” of their group. Everyone, of course, has adjustment problems of one kind or another. Satisfactory adjustment as here defined does not mean perfect contentment and complete absence of problems, but rather the ability to cope adequately with difficulties in the personal make-up or in the subject’s environment. Worry and anxiety when warranted by the circumstances, or a tendency to be somewhat high strung or nervous–provided such a tendency did not constitute a definite personality problem–were allowed in this category. 2. Some maladjustment. Classified here were subjects with excessive feelings of inadequacy or inferiority, nervous fatigue, mild anxiety neurosis, and the like. The emotional conflicts, nervous tendencies and social maladjustments of these individuals, while they presented definite problems, were not beyond the ability of the individual to handle, and there was no marked interference with social or personal life or with achievement. Subjects whose behavior was noticeably odd or freakish, but without evidence of serious neurotic tendencies, were also classified in this category. 3. Serious maladjustment. a.) Classified as 3a were subjects who had shown marked symptoms of anxiety, mental depression, personality maladjustment, or psychopathic personality. This classification also includes subjects who had suffered a “nervous breakdown,” provided the condition was not severe enough to constitute a psychosis. Subjects with a previous history of serious maladjustment or nervous breakdown (without psychosis) were included here even though their adjustment at the time of rating may have been entirely satisfactory. b.) Classified as 3b were those subjects who had at any time suffered a complete mental breakdown requiring hospitalization, whatever their condition at the time of rating. In the majority of cases the subjects were restored to reasonably good mental health after a brief period of hospital care [6, pp. 99-101].</p>
<p>In 1940, when the group was about 29 years of age, a large scale examination was carried out. Included in that examination was a high level test of verbal intelligence, designated at that time the Concept Mastery, but later re-named the Concept Mastery test form A. Terman found the following relationship between adjustment and verbal intelligence. (These are raw scores, not IQs.)</p>

<p>The data show three things. First, that there is a definite trend for the maladjusted to make higher scores on the Concept Mastery test. Second, that women show symptoms of maladjustment at lower scores than men. And third, that 21 percent of the men and 18 percent of the women showed at least some form of maladjustment.</p>
<p>During 1950-52, when the group was approximately 41 years old, another examination was made using a new test, the Concept Mastery test form T. Test scores were again compared to assessments of adjustment. (CMT-T scores are not interchangeable with CMT-A scores. They have different means and standard deviations.)</p>

<p>Similar conclusions can be drawn from these data as well. Again, there is a definite trend shown for the maladjusted to make higher scores than the satisfactorily adjusted. Again, women show symptoms of maladjustment at lower scores than men. But the most alarming thing of all is that the percentage of maladjustment shown for both sexes rose in the 12 years since the previous examination. The percentage of men showing maladjustment having risen from 21 percent to 29 percent, and the figure for women having risen from 18 percent to 33 percent! Nearly double what it was before!</p>
<p>How did Terman interpret these data? Terman states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although severe mental maladjustment is in general somewhat more common among subjects who score high on the Concept Mastery test, many of the most successful men of the entire group also scored high on this test [7, p. 50].</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Terman deliberately tried to give the impression that the relationship between verbal intelligence and mental and social maladjustment was weak and unreliable. He did this by misdirection. He gave a truthful answer to an irrelevant question. Terman failed to realize that a small difference in means between two or more distributions can have a dramatic effect on the percentage of each group found at the tails of the distribution. The relevant questions should have been “what is the percentage of maladjustment found at different levels of ability, and does this show a trend?” Terman’s data can be used to find answers to these questions.</p>
<p>The method used to solve this problem is a relatively simple one but tedious in detail. (See appendix.) The results, however, are easy to understand. Using CMT-T scores for men as an illustration, and pooling the data for some maladjustment and serious maladjustment, the following percentages can be obtained.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Triple Nine Society averages 155.16 on the CMT-T, and the average score for Prometheus Society members is 169.95 [1, 2]. The implications are staggering, especially when it is realized that these percentages do not include women, who show more maladjustment at lower CMT-T scores than men do. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why super high IQ societies suffer so much from schisms and a tendency towards disintegration. In any event, one thing is certain.

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.

	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.

            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.
          </p>

          <p>
            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

<h3 id="Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently">Data Integrity Errors Fail Silently<a href="#Data-Integrity-Errors-Fail-Silently"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

<h3 id="Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code">Technical Debt: <code>No Tests == Legacy Code</code><a href="#Technical-Debt:-No-Tests-==-Legacy-Code"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

<div>
<p>Statistical typing extends the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">logical data types</a>
to the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type">statistical data types</a>
and, ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">probability distributions</a>.
Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>What if you can specify the set of acceptable values that a variable can take,
from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>

<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>

<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>

</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>

<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>

    <p>I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing.</p>
<p>But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>
<p><em>“A carbon tax is the most straight-forward and efficient strategy for quickly
reducing greenhouse gas emissions”</em> - Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT)<label for="b1f4d654302ad3f9065ea4f63103ba604fdb4ad6f1809e4488b966a398d887e8"></label><span>This quote is from his <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-we-need-a-carbon-tax_b_5571408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 op-ed in the
HuffPost</a>.
Senator Sanders’ had previously proposed a bill that priced carbon emissions at
$20 a ton, and returned 60% of the income to Americans.
</span></p>
<p>Thank you Senator Sanders! Stay warm out there.</p>
<p>Like I said, I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing. It
used to be the policy issue that could get Bernie Sanders and <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26082018/john-mccain-climate-change-leadership-senate-cap-trade-bipartisan-lieberman-republican-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John
McCain</a>
rubbing ideological elbows, but no more, and not because conservatives left the
table. As carbon pricing has gained purchase with <a href="https://www.clcouncil.org/media/2017/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-Carbon-Dividends.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate
conservatives</a>,
it seems to have lost even more among progressives.</p>
<p>Some evidence for my concern:</p>
<h4 id="I"><a href="#I" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>At the start of this essay, I quoted Bernie Sanders’ full throated support of a
carbon tax. That was 2014. Two years later, Senator Sanders hammered Hillary
Clinton in primary debates for her reticence to back a carbon tax. And then
after losing the nomination, he semi-successfully lobbied to give emissions
pricing a mention in the party platform. And then the 2020 Democratic primary
rolled around and…nothing? His campaign was completely silent on emissions
pricing. No mention of it in his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14,000+ word climate
plan</a>.</p>
<h4 id="II"><a href="#II" title="II."></a>II.</h4><p>Whenever discussion around a Green New Deal gets into specifics, some of its
supporters seem to lightly chafe against emissions pricing, usually by omission
but sometimes outright.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HR
109</a> and
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SR 59</a>,
the pair of congressional resolutions which establish the spirit of the Green
New Deal, don’t mention any form of emissions pricing. Critiques of the language
of these resolutions have been met with the gentle reminder that they’re
resolutions, not specific plans. They’re meant to establish urgency and vision,
not get into details. And yet, into detail they get! Surely if “<em>‘smart’ power
grids”</em> and “<em>proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage, such
as land preservation and afforestation”</em> are not too granular to mention,
something as simple as a price on carbon might merit a bullet point?</p>
<p>This is especially true as carbon pricing schemes that direct their revenue
towards green investments or return them to Americans as checks fit very well
into the key insight of the Green New Deal: to focus not on obscure climate
policy, but on tangible markers of prosperity like jobs and growth.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Sunrise Movement gets a lot of press as a prominent, young
advocacy group who’ve basically staked their entire platform on the principles
laid out in HR 109. They don’t seem to prioritize carbon pricing much. For
example, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317124840/https://scorecard.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Democratic primary
scorecard</a>
chiefly rated candidates on how their climate plan aligned with the tenets of a
Green New Deal. Out of the many specific policy dimensions candidates were
ranked against, no mention of emissions pricing<label for="61b6a510e04d569dd009f697e716ddae2825deb0dbaa0ca724e29aa589c6da5c"></label><span>Actually, they did have one dimension in the “How They Talk About It”
section: “Proposes solutions beyond taxes and regulation” which seems…kind of
anti-carbon-pricing? Warren and Sanders got 4/4, Biden got 2/4. Out of those
three, Biden is the only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly support carbon
pricing</a>.
Warren is “open to it” and Sanders is a no. The analysis on Biden’s score was
that his “plan relies heavily on market-mechanism solutions such as tax
incentives and regulations” while Senator Warren’s plans are “are not unduly
limited to reliance on traditional market mechanisms” and Senator Sanders’
“plans rely heavily on direct investment and direct intervention at the federal
level through a total of $16.3 trillion of federal funding.”
</span>.</p>
<h4 id="III"><a href="#III" title="III."></a>III.</h4><p>There’s fatigue from weak and byzantine carbon pricing schemes like
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California’s cap-and-trade
system</a>.
And there’s a wariness among the progressive left towards anything market based
in general.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez captures this mix of fatigue and anti-market
sentiment pretty well,
<a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting</a>,</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For far too long, ideas
like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to
climate change.</p><p>While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND
resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.</p><p>The pipes in
Flint weren’t a “market failure.”</p></div>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February
10, 2019</a></blockquote> 


<p>It is a long road from Bernie Sanders’ centerpiece climate policy to “could be
part of a solution”. Bewilderingly, this fall from grace is set against a
backdrop of consistent support from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/climate/carbon-tax-united-nations-report-nordhaus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific and economic
communities</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is not good. In moving away from emissions pricing, we are
discarding one of our most valuable tools, not just for combating climate
change, but for building the political will needed for the fight.</p>
<p>In the following, I’ll make the case that emissions pricing—in the form of a
carbon dividend—is good policy, in a climate sense, in a progressive sense, and
in a political economy sense. This is true for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the <em>very</em> <em>least</em>, a carbon dividend can be thought of as a wealth
transfer from the fossil fuel industry and the wealthy to low and middle
income households, and one that also reduces emission by anywhere from a
little to a lot.</li>
<li>There is no better policy for getting people invested in climate change than
to compensate them directly for the damage fossil fuels are doing to their
world.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should establish common ground on what a modern plan for carbon pricing looks
like. The state of the art has moved well past cap-and-trade systems, and
real-world data from other countries is giving us a better idea of what works
and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Vast oceans of argument rise or fall on fairly technical policy choices, so we
want to be precise here. The more correct term is probably emissions pricing, as
what we’re talking about is raising the cost of emitting a whole host of
greenhouse gases<label for="e10a095059e8611aa37caae4ab96865b5846538baf7f378a7a68f962e3ebea5a"></label><span>For example, we want it to be very expensive to emit methane, which the
IPCC highlights as a critical target for reduction.
</span>, but because of carbon’s existence as a shorthand for many
pollutants, I’ll use emissions and carbon pricing interchangeably.</p>
<p>There are many policies that fall under emissions pricing. For example,
California has a cap and trade policy, which sets a cap on statewide emissions
and then lets companies trade permits that represent their slice of the
emissions pie. In a somewhat roundabout way, this effectively sets a price on
carbon. However, for a myriad of reasons, cap and trade is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really hard to get
right</a>,
especially with the ever present lobbying of Oil and Gas. Another common policy
is a carbon tax, though for reasons we’ll get to, it has some politically
pernicious effects. What I describe in the following paragraphs are the
fundamentals of a <em>carbon dividend</em>, a radically effective approach to emissions
pricing.</p>
<h4 id="I-1"><a href="#I-1" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>First and foremost, emissions pricing is not a cure-all. But it sits at the
heart of pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Climate change is a many-headed hydra. We need<label for="b8d55523d6a79612bdd6b30e5246de1e8b8fd158451e5a633fea885620a0e88e"></label><span>Non-exhaustive list incoming, but loosely sourced from some of the top
solutions from <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project
Drawdown</a>.
</span> reliable, renewable energy at
a competitive price, we need to reduce emissions from agriculture, transit,
housing, and refrigeration, and at the same time, keep people fed, employed,
housed, and cool in ever-hotter summers. And while the suburban homeowner might
be the first to install solar panels and better insulation, she’ll fight you on
density and transit. And while France promises to decarbonize, her former
colonies, reliant on colonially-imposed, export-oriented monocultures, have
inherited colonialism’s plunderous economic model.</p>
<p>No, there is no silver bullet for this. But there is a common thread. It is
cheap to emit. But emission itself is not cheap—hurricanes and wildfires
supercharged by a changing climate are testament to that. This disparity
underlies virtually all the facets of the climate crisis. The suburbs can
sprawl, because it is cheap to drive everywhere and heat huge homes. We can have
our grass-fed<label for="6c3e273de5c1427c5f55beb6db4d797da0c0bd0aac7cf8729737d7d1392843ff"></label><span>Grass fed cows <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/13/746576239/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-the-planet-heres-the-science#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20past%20studies,belches%20over%20their%20longer%20lifespans." target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce more methane over their lifetime than feedlot
cows</a>
since they take longer to grow to full size. However, the grasslands they graze
on sequester a lot of carbon. So if you’re creating or preserving grass for the
cows, grass-fed might actually emit less. But, if the grasses were already going
to be there, grass-fed seems worse. It’s not super clear.
</span> steaks and eat them too, because California wildfire victims
don’t get to collect on cow burps<label for="bd3632af708cb83cfe141b2b9463e4fd352d0bbd4c4770066310ec89011ec4e0"></label><span>They do, however, get to collect on Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, whose
equipment started the fire. Except, that’s really expensive, so PG&amp;E goes
bankrupt. And as part of that bankruptcy, they agree to pay the wildfire victims
with <em>shares of PG&amp;E</em>. On this topic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-13/it-s-good-if-people-want-tesla-stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg’s Matt
Levine</a>
writes, “In the ordinary course, the way U.S. bankruptcy and corporate law works
is that if a company owes people more money than it can pay, those people get to
own the company instead. Thus, if a company does bad enough things to enough
people, the remedy is that those people end up owning the company.” Except, not
starting wildfires as a power company in California is pretty hard, and so it’s
pretty likely that PG&amp;E, who is now actually just the victims of last year’s
wildfire, will get sued by the victims of <em>this year’s</em> wildfires. “The rule is
the rule: If you own a company and it does a lot of harm, you have to give the
company to the people it harmed, even if you only own the company because you’re
one of the people it previously harmed.”

      <h3 id="accidental-habit-development-a-year-of-walking">Accidental Habit Development: A year of walking</h3><p>I'm terrible at setting new habits. I've tried every habit app, journal method, hiding things, etc and I'm still at around 10% success rate of choosing a new habit and sticking to it.</p><p>One thing I've learned: I'm equally terrible at the habit of using habit apps.</p><p>Nearly by accident, I set a new habit in 2020 that has been consistent for 320 straight days: taking a walk. February last year, I set a (tiny) goal of walking for at least 10 minutes. Every day. I used the Streaks App, but connected to Apple Heatlh. Any time I started a walk on the Apple Watch, the time was automatically tracked in Streaks. No manual tracking required. Any time I completed a walk of 10 minutes or more, I'd get a push notification from Streaks happily encouraging me for completing my task and updating my progress.</p><p>When I first started, I was consistent because of a nascent willpower. I'd set a goal in a moment of aspriation and wanted it done. Walking 10 minutes was also <strong>easy</strong>: if I was close to missing a day, I'd feel silly not to walk 5 minutes away from my house and back. The Streaks app also acted as a safety net. If I hadn't completed a walk, I'd get a notification <strong>prompt</strong> that I was about to "break the streak". FOMO kicked in and I'd dutifully get up and start a brisk walk. It was also <strong>automated</strong>, I didn't have to build the habit of using a habit app, everything just worked. </p><p>Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> Instead of trying to make a big change, the task was very achievable, even when motivation was low. It's more important to build consistency. The snowball rolling down the top of the mountain.</li><li><strong>Automated:</strong> The main value of a habit app is showing progress and keeping you honest (see prompts below). The problem is they require a separate behavior: tracking if your goal is done! Because the tracking is coupled with the behavior (taking a walk updates the Streaks app), all the value is received with no extra effort.</li><li><strong>Prompts: </strong>The system defaults to "internal" prompts: I should walk because I want to. But, if it's an off day or motivation is low, the Streaks app detects when a miss is imminent and sends a notification. It's like a safety net for habit development.</li></ul><p>Over time something changed... I wasn't doing the walk because it was easy. I was walking because it was just something I did."You're awake, time to walk." Walks became more than just a basic way to improve fitness. They became thinking time, time to call my Dad, or jot notes and thoughts. Now I walk 1-2 hours every morning (have had to wake up earlier for this) and can't imagine giving it up.</p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-1--52-.png"></figure><h3 id="how-does-behavior-science-explain-why-this-works">How does behavior science explain why this works?</h3><p>BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has popularized the <a href="https://behaviormodel.org/">"Fogg Behavior Model" (FBM)</a>. The FBM states that each <strong>behavior</strong> consists of: sufficient <strong>motivation</strong>, sufficient <strong>ability</strong>, and the presence of a <strong>prompt</strong>. Without all three, the behavior doesn't happen. </p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/image.jpeg"><figcaption>Credit: BJ Fogg (behaviormodel.org)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</blockquote><p>This explains why the walking habit stuck while others have not. The behavior required very little motivation or ability. Most importantly, loading the next prompt required zero behavior. The act of walking loaded up the next prompt and Streaks could know whether to alert to a potential miss. </p><p>What if I could apply the same principles to other habits? A system to <strong>automatically prompt</strong> <strong>easy</strong> habits?</p><h3 id="automated-information-diet-habits">Automated Information Diet Habits</h3><p>One key 2021 focus for me is my information diet. There's a glut of urgent, must-know-now, break-neck-paced news coming out the past year. And it's not slowing down. I want to stay informed, but doom-scrolling doesn't help.</p><p>The first part of improving my information diet involved setting limits on <strong>neutral-bad inputs: </strong>increase social media (Twitter/LinkedIn for me) use, mindless reddit browser, etc. h/t to Brendan Short's "<a href="https://whatilearned.substack.com/">What I Learned</a>" Substack for ideas to limit Screen Time. </p><p>The second part involves increasing input of <strong>good inputs.</strong> I'm trying to increase the time I spend reading books and long form articles. And I've found a system (10 days in) that uses the same principle as the walk habit.</p><p><strong>Here's how the system works high-level:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-2--10-.png"></figure><ol><li>Whenever I open an app for long-form articles or books (Pocket, Kindle) a timer is started in Streaks automatically</li><li>When I close the app, the timer is stopped</li><li>When the cumulative goal time (10 minutes for now) is reached, the daily Streak is marked complete</li></ol><p>That's it. That's the system. It hits all the necessary ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> The goals are simple 10 minutes reading a book and 10 minutes reading for learning. And since the goal is cumulative time, dropping into a book for 2 minutes still has positive reinforcement. </li><li><strong>Automatic: </strong>No need to separately track the goal. The act of doing the task is coupled with tracking the goal.</li><li><strong>Prompts:</strong> The Streaks app notifies externally if I'm about to miss a streak. But I'm also testing a new passive prompt: app recommendations. I've replaced half my home screen with a widget that displays "Siri recommended apps". Based on how you use your phone, apps are suggested to open. I'm noticing Kindle and Pocket showing up in this list more and more over the past ten days. </li></ul><p>So far, I'm 100% covering every day (even though not every day has been high motivation). Excited to share more as the habits build momentum.</p><hr><h3 id="how-exactly-the-system-works-and-how-you-can-use-it-too-">How exactly the system works. And how you can use it too.</h3><p>The secret to automatically tracking my reading involves the Streaks habit app, and Apple's built-in Shortcuts app. </p><p>Shortcuts allow for setting up workflows on your iPhone/iPad similar to IFTTT or Zapier but for apps. They also include "Personal Automations" that automatically run shortcuts when certain conditions are true: connecting to WiFi, arriving home, or (importantly) when certain apps are opened or closed. </p><p>I created two shortcuts that accept the name (or keyword) of a Timed Task in Streaks, and start or stop respectively the timer for that task. </p><p>For each app I want to trigger a Timed Task, I create a "Start" and "Stop" Personal Automation that includes the name (or keyword) of the desired Task and starts when a given app is opened or closed. </p><h3 id="running-this-yourself-">Running this yourself. </h3><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ak0p6VFDT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>How the automatic tracking looks at the end.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Streaks App</a> and setup at least one <em>timed </em>task.

Something that would feel silly <em>not</em> to do if you missed it. </li><li>Open the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334">Shortcuts</a> app on your phone (built-in) and run at least one of the Shortcuts in the gallery. <em>Apple will not let you follow the below process until you've run at least one Shortcut.</em></li><li>Open Settings &gt; Shortcuts and select "Allow Untrusted Shortcuts".

    <p><a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a> is a unikernel, which is completely written Rust. <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> are application images that directly contain the kernel as a library, so they do not require an installed operating system (OS).&nbsp;They are typical used in virtualized environments, which build the backbone of typical cloud / edge infrastructures.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>


<h2 id="virtualization-designs">Virtualization Designs</h2>
<p>Common virtualized environments are based on classical <strong><em>virtual machines</em></strong>. In this case, complete machines are emulated or virtualized and common operating systems are running on both host and guest site:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/common_vm.png" alt="Structure of a common virtualitation environment"></p>
<p>This technique is established (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) and widely used. However, it introduces additional overhead especially regarding memory consumption and performance.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to common virtual machines is <strong><em>OS-level
virtualization</em></strong>, where the&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;allows the existence of multiple
isolated&nbsp;user space&nbsp;instances. These isolated instances are also known
as container. A typical representative is LXC or Docker and promise less
overhead in comparison to common virtual machines. However, the
isolation between the processes is weaker and may provide less security.</p>
<h2 id="unikernels">Unikernels</h2>
<p>Often only one application (e.g. a web server) is running in the container or the virtual machine. In this case, a <em>unikernel</em> is an attractive solution. The kernel is provided as static library and linked to the application. As the images directly contain the OS kernel, unikernels can directly be booted inside a virtual machine and do not require the typical software stack containing a Linux kernel and its userland within the VM.</p>
<p>Unikernels do not provide system calls in the classical sense, as everything is running with the privilege level of a kernel and what is typically done via system calls is provided via a common function call. At first glance, this sounds more insecure than previous approaches. However, these kernels are expected to run within a virtual machine, which isolates the application from the real system. In addition, common compiler analysis is used to check the complete software stack and unneeded components can even be removed, which can reduce the attack surface of the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png" alt="Structure of a library operating system"></p>
<p>Well known unikernels are kernels such as <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>
and <a href="http://www.unikraft.org/">Unikraft</a>. MirageOS is written in OCaml,
while Unikraft still uses C as programming language. In contrast to these
kernels, RustyHermit is completely written in Rust to benefit from
Rust's performance and security behavior.</p>
<h2 id="rustyhermit">RustyHermit</h2>
<p>In principle, every existing
Rust application can be built on top of RustyHermit. However, unikernels
are a single tasking operating system. Consequently, the support of the
system call <code>fork</code> and inter-process communication are missing. In
addition, a classical C library is missing, which is typical used as
interface to the operating system. Every crate, which bypasses the
standard runtime and tries to communicate directly to operating system
does not work without modifications. However, many applications do not
depend on these features and work on RustyHermit.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Unikernels can be highly optimized. For instance, we optimized the
network stack of RustyHermit. RustyHermit uses
<a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a> as network stack, which
is completely written in Rust. As interface between guest and host
operating system, we use
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a>, which is in a
para-virtualized driver for KVM and widely used in virtualized Linux
environments.</p>
<p>The following figure compares Linux with RustyHermit,
where both are running as guests inside a virtual machine running on top
of a Linux-based host system:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/bandwidth.png" alt="Bandwidth of the RustyHermit's exerimental network interface"></p>
<p>Especially for small messages RustHermit
is faster in than Linux.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>RustyHermit is also a research project to evaluate new operating
system designs, which improves the scalability and the security of operating systems in cloud environments. For instance, RustyHermit provides classical
techniques to improve the security behavior like stack guards and
separating the application stack from the libOS stack. However, a
library operating system typically uses a common function call to enter
the kernel. A classical separation of user- and kernel space by
entering a higher privilege level is missing.</p>
<p>We presented in a
<a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee20-mpk.pdf">paper</a> a modified
version of RustyHermit, which provides an intra-unikernel isolation with
<em>Intel Memory Protection Keys</em> (MPK). MPK is a relatively new hardware
primitive that provides per-thread permission control over groups of
pages in a single address space with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/park-soyeon">negligible switching overhead</a>,
making it a compelling candidate for use in unikernels.</p>
<p>MPK is requiring modification of page tables at a small performance cost. Four previously-unused bits of each page table entry (the 62nd to the 59th on x86-64) are exploited by MPK. Since MPK exploits four bits of the page table entry, it supports up to 15 protection keys.
MPK controls per-thread permission on groups of pages. Each core has a PKRU register (32 bits) containing a permission value. The value of the PKRU register defines the permission of the thread currently running on that core for each group of pages containing a protection key in their page table entries. Unlike page-table-level permission, MPK provides thread-local memory permission.</p>
<p>We provide user / kernel separation so we simply see the entire application as an untrusted component, independently of application-specific characteristics such as the language it is written in or the level of skill of the application’s programmer. In addition, we divide the kernel code into trusted and untrusted components. Trusted kernel components represent pieces of code written with a memory-safe language, i.e., offering strong security guarantees. Untrusted kernel components correspond to code written either in memory-unsafe languages or in unsafe Rust code blocks.</p>
<p>By entering the library operating system through the application binary interface the protection keys will be automatically changed, which allows access to the kernel stack and the kernel heap. Unauthorized access from within the application will trigger a pagefault, which will be handled by the library operating system.</p>
<h3 id="example-project">Example Project</h3>
<p>To give you an example on how to build an RustyHermit application, lets create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> new hello_world
</span><span>cd</span><span> hello_world
</span></code></pre>
<p>RustyHermit currently requires the nightly versions of the Rust toolchain.
To simplify the workflow, we recommend to create the configuration
<em>rust-toolchain</em> as follows to define the required components and to
tested version of nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code><span>[toolchain]
</span><span>channel </span><span>= "</span><span>nightly-2020-12-23</span><span>"
</span><span>components </span><span>= [ "</span><span>rustfmt</span><span>", "</span><span>rust-src</span><span>", "</span><span>llvm-tools-preview</span><span>"]
</span><span>targets </span><span>= [ "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>" ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file specifies the required components and the version of the nightly compiler to use.</p>
<p>The RustyHermit's target <code>x86_64-unknown-hermit</code> is part of Rust
supported platforms, but doesn't belong to the <em>tier 1</em> platforms,
which means that official binary releases aren't available and the
standard runtime must be build from scratch.
To simplify this build process, we recommend to create the configuration
file <code>.cargo/config</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>[unstable]
</span><span>build-std </span><span>= ["</span><span>std</span><span>", "</span><span>core</span><span>", "</span><span>alloc</span><span>", "</span><span>panic_abort</span><span>"]

[build]
</span><span>target </span><span>= "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>To bind the library operating system to the application, we have to add the crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys"><code>hermit-sys</code></a> to the dependencies in the file <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Cargo.toml

</span><span>[target.'</span><span>cfg(target_os = "hermit")</span><span>'.dependencies]
</span><span>hermit-sys </span><span>= "</span><span>0.1.*</span><span>"
</span><span>features </span><span>= ["</span><span>smoltcp</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The feature <code>smoltcp</code> is required if your application tries
to establish a TCP connection. In this case, the library operating systems
includes the TCP/stack <a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a>.
In addition <em>hermit-sys</em> depends on the tool <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download">cargo-download</a> to download required components and must be installed with the command <code>cargo install cargo-download</code>.
Finally, the application can be build with the common command <code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a 64-bit excutable in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">executable link format</a> (ELF).
To start the application within a common virtual machine, a loader is required, which initialize the processor and start the applications.
We provide a simple loader on <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader">GitHub</a>.
A makefile to build the loader is part of the project.
After that, Qemu can be used to start RustyHermit in a VM as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_app/app</span><span> -cpu</span><span> qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,fxsr
</span></code></pre>
<p>To improve the performance, KVM can be used to use the virtualization extension of modern processors.</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_hello_world/hello_world</span><span> -enable-kvm -cpu</span><span> host
</span></code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>For the near future, we plan to stabilize the interface to the hardware.
For instance, the support of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">Virtio-fs</a>
is in an early stage. In addition, the integration into Rust standard
library isn't finalized yet and the current version runs only on x86. In the
future, we want to also support aarch64 as processor architecture.</p>

				<p>I consider myself a software craftsman. As every craftsman, I take good care of my craft. I create it, I augment it, and occasionally I reduce it. </p><p>Adding new features always makes me happy and I can understand why. I augment something that I really care about, making it even better. What I find difficult to understand is why I take so much joy when I am deleting code.</p><p>It just doesn't make sense. Every line of code I wrote has cost me time and/or mental effort. Sometimes a significant amount of both. I should feel bad when I figure out that I don't need this massive block of code or this feature is just useless and needs to be removed. </p><p>My only explanation is that it has to do with my mental model when building and understanding software. By default, I try to fit the entire program I am working on in my mind. By fit, I mean that, at some capacity, I try to be able to "dry run" the program myself. I can "calculate" what output the program might produce when certain inputs are given. </p><p>And I do this almost all the time while developing. When modifying a method, when refactoring some part of the code, when moving variables around. I quickly perform "tests" to ensure that I am not breaking anything.</p><p>(Ideally, software is split into self-contained modules for this exact reason: to be able to work on a module without the need to understand almost anything outside of it. But in reality, this rarely happens. Modules are rarely self-contained and small enough projects are not split into modules at all. Anyway, this is a subject for another time.)</p><p>Therefore, I suspect that the joy I get when I have to delete some code is not for the deletion per se. The joy comes from the simplification. If the codebase is reduced then it will be easier to "fit" it in my mind when trying to "dry run" it.</p><p>This better understanding leads to increased happiness when working on the codebase and the joy I am referring to. I am not happy about getting rid of something I spend time and energy on in the past. I am happy because the reduced code size will require less mental effort when working on that project.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/subscribe/"><strong>Subscribe to our non-annoying-once-a-month digest :)</strong></a></p><hr><p>So there you go. Go and delete that unneeded feature without feeling guilty about the joy you get. Until another feature takes its place and you are back to square 0 :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <section itemprop="articleBody"> <p>SwiftUI was introduced to the world at WWDC in June 2019. While the main goal for SwiftUI is to build rich user interfaces on iOS and other Apple platforms, it can also be used to do other fun things.</p> <p>I couldn’t resist using SwiftUI from the command line, and I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/@eneko/rasterizing-swiftui-views-from-the-command-line-80d974356c4a">Rasterizing SwiftUI views from the command line</a> to showcase how to generate static images (PNG, JPEG, etc). I published the code in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a>.</p> <p>Last December I used this same technique to generate social media preview images for this blog. I wrote <a href="https://www.enekoalonso.com/articles/issue-13">Generating Social Media preview images with SwiftUI and GitHub Actions</a> so other people like you could do it too.</p> <p>Today, I’m writing about generating application icons for iOS with SwiftUI. You guessed it: from the command line.</p> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2> <p>You can start by cloning my <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a> repo, which I have updated today to run on Xcode 12.4 with the latest SwiftUI available. Feel free to begin with an empty project too. If you do this, you’d probably want to follow the steps on the README file from that repo, or refer back to my first article on this topic.</p> <p>Xcode does not support live previews on Swift packages yet (FB8979344). To allow for realtime previews follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Generate an Xcode project (<code>swift package generate-xcodeproj</code>)</li> <li>Add a macOS target to the project</li> <li>Add your view to the macOS target (target <code>Foo</code> on the screenshot below)</li> </ol> <p>The generated project and target files don’t need to be committed to your repository, but you can do it if that makes it easier for later use.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922/105608907-b6c90800-5d5a-11eb-80d9-32de73138e75.png" alt="MySwiftUIView"></p> <p>If you cloned <code>ConsoleUI</code>, at this point you should be able to run the following commands:</p> <div><div><pre><code>swift build                  <span># build project</span>
swift run <span>&amp;&amp;</span> open test.png   <span># rasterize image and open in Preview app</span>

First, it implies that the latter is an external invader that bears no essential relation to the liberal society that they believe it threatens, even though their own account suggests otherwise: that critical theory is an exaggerated version of the virtues (such as “skepticism”) they attribute to liberalism. Second, their reliance on metaphor is in tension with their assertion that language can straightforwardly characterize reality.</p><p>In the <a href="https://outsidertheory.com/metanarrative-obsolescence-on-cynical-theories-part-2/">second installment</a>, I noted that despite their objection to the “postmodern theme” of the “power of language,” they attribute a great deal of power to language, since they believe that a handful of not particularly widely read books have single-handedly undermined the basis of liberal democracy. Returning to the seminal account of the “postmodern condition” elaborated by Jean-François Lyotard, I attempted to offer a more materially grounded account of the rise of the body of thought Pluckrose and Lindsay are describing. In the process, I challenged their assumptions about the process by which “postmodern” ideas have spread.</p><p>Here, I will continue to make the case that the “postmodern principles” and “themes” Pluckrose and Lindsay are targeting derive directly from the internal evolution of the scientifically and technologically advanced liberal capitalist societies they set out to defend. I will begin by returning to one of their “postmodern themes,” which I also addressed previously: “the power of language.”</p><p>“Under postmodernism,” they state, “many ideas that had previously been regarded as objectively true came to be seen as mere constructions of language.” They appear to be bemused and baffled by the “reject[ion of] the commonsense idea that words refer straightforwardly to things in the real world,” and make no effort to understand why anyone might come to question this idea, much less why it might lose traction more broadly. Instead, they resort to pathologization, attributing to postmodern thinkers like Jacques Derrida an “obsession with language” and a “neurotic postmodern fixation upon words.” Again, their indifference to causal explanation is striking: given that such an emphasis on language has become widespread, one might imagine that, even if it is as delusional as they say, they would be interested in the conditions that have made people embrace it. But no such curiosity is evident in their account.</p><p>A more precise term for the emphasis on the “power of language” Pluckrose and Lindsay are describing is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn">the linguistic turn</a>,” a phrase popularized by the philosopher Richard Rorty. Numerous disciplines, beginning with philosophy and spreading across the humanities, became increasingly focused on language over the course of the twentieth century, especially its latter half. Yet this shift in emphasis did not begin with postmodern thought, but with philosophers like Frege and Russell, and somewhat later in French structuralism, which attempted to apply the scientific advances achieved in modern linguistics to a broad array of cultural phenomena by way of various disciplines. The centering of language, then, began not with skeptics and relativists, but with thinkers who viewed the systematic study of language as a means of elaborating a more rigorous methodology in philosophy and the “human sciences.”</p><p>This fact is significant because the “linguistic turn” also closely tracks the scientific and technological advances of the twentieth century and the broader economic and social changes they enabled. As discussed previously, Lyotard refers to the “computerization” of knowledge and the economy over the course of postwar period the main source of the “postmodern condition.” In essence, the latter phrase is another way of referring to what others have dubbed the “information society.” As Lyotard writes: “in a society whose communication component is becoming more prominent day by day, both as a reality and as an issue it is clear that language assumes a new importance.” This development, he says, is closely related to the expansion of language-oriented fields of research, including “phonology and theories of linguistics, problems of communication and cybernetics, modern theories of algebra and informatics, computers and their languages, problems of translation and the search for areas of compatibility among computer languages, problems of information storage and data banks, telematics and the perfection of intelligent terminals…”</p><p>The “linguistic turn,” then, has its basis in shifts in social and economic relations, and has far broader intellectual effects than the emergence of the specific academic theories that usually fall under the heading of “postmodernism.” The “power of language” has become a central theme in an era when language, in the general sense of the term, plays a key role in the production process. To regard a thinker like Derrida’s preoccupation with language as a personal idiosyncrasy, as Pluckrose and Lindsay seem to do, is to ignore this context.</p><p>We do not need to look to a “postmodern” thinker like Lyotard to find versions of this observation. Back in 1991, the liberal economist and Robert Reich coined the term “symbolic analysts” to describe the rising white-collar workforce of the post-industrial economy. The point of Reich’s use of this term is that a variety of professions, from graphic designers to engineers to lawyers to financial analysts to newspaper editors, centrally involve the manipulation of symbols. In a computerized society oriented toward the production and circulation of information, Reich argued, those who acquired symbol-manipulation skills would be rewarded, while those engaged in manual work would decline in status. Furthermore, as the acceleration of these trends magnified inequality, these skilled workers would pull away more and more from the rest of the population, economically and culturally. Reich called this the “secession of the symbolic analysts.”</p><p>In his 1994 book <em>The Revolt of the Elites</em>, historian and cultural critic Christopher Lasch builds on Reich’s analysis of this class. He writes that “[t]hey live in a world of abstractions and images, a simulated world that consists of computerized models of reality—’hyperreality,’ as it has been called.” In a brief but suggestive passage, Lasch links the popularization of “postmodernist thought” to “the experience of living in an artificial environment from which everything that resists human control (unavoidably, everything familiar and reassuring as well) has been rigorously excluded.” He writes that as a result, “the thinking classes have seceded not just from the common world around them but from reality itself.” Lasch’s diagnosis roughly accords with that of “postmodernists” like Lyotard and especially Baudrillard, who was not attempting to promote “hyperreality” but to chart its emergence out of a specific set of economic and technological arrangements. Lasch, however, was perhaps too certain that those outside of the elite sphere would avoid being subsumed within this “artificial environment.”</p><p>Since Lasch’s death in the same year <em>Revolt</em> appeared, two developments have made his book prophetic in unanticipated ways. First of all, almost all of us have become “symbolic analysts” in our free time even if not in our working lives. That is, the computerized environment that was largely restricted to white-collar offices in the 1980s and early 1990s has become the universal domain of the screen, in which we all exist during work, leisure, or both. Second, the prospects of younger entrants to the “symbolic analyst” class have declined. As Julius Krein <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/11/the-real-class-war/">documents</a>, this decline correlates with the increasing radicalization of political discourse among the highly educated. Unsurprisingly, if we take seriously Lasch’s account of the submersion in artificiality the computerization of experience entails, this radicalization has been inflected by the “postmodern themes” Pluckrose and Lindsay document. This is not simply because these ideas have been widely taught in universities, as they seem to think, but because they are intuitive to people whose lives take place online.</p><p>In <em>Life on the Screen</em>, a prescient book that appeared just a year after Lasch’s <em>Revolt</em>, sociologist Sherry Turkle anticipated this ongoing process. Her book was one of the first to focus on how the internet was shifting people’s experiences of social life and individual identity. She was writing a decade before the mass adoption of social media, but her analysis centers on one of its forerunners, Multi-User Domains (MUDs). She writes that in such spaces, “technology is bringing a set of ideas associated with postmodernism . . . into everyday life.” Echoing the link between computerization and the linguistic turn proposed previously, she states: “In my computer-mediated worlds, the self is multiple, fluid, and constituted in interaction with machine connections; it is made and transformed by language.” “Computers,” she concludes, “embody postmodern theory and bring it down to earth.” When Turkle wrote these statements in 1995, she was describing what were still relatively niche experiences. Today, what Turkle calls the “multiple, fluid self made by language” is the main forms in which most of us present ourselves to the world.</p><p>With this background in mind, the emergence of the “postmodern themes” documented by Pluckrose and Lindsay looks more like an effect of profound material, social, and economic changes than of the influence of a few dozen philosophers. The wide resonance of those themes helps account for the popularity of those philosophers’ ideas, which have furnished a portion of the educated class with a kind of mythology of the information age. However, the same themes have also pervaded …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On January 14 this year, Google bought Fitbit (a &nbsp;wearables company) for 2.1 billion dollars!</p><p>The question is why a big name like Google buy a smaller company like Fitbit and such an acquisition is worth billions of dollars?!</p><p>The same question goes for many big names and another question comes up because these big companies have very talented engineers who are able to replicate what small ones can do. So what makes big companies think about buying more in the first place?</p><p>Reasons may differ from one company to another; it may also interchange with another reason, but we can distill some important reasons why acquisitions can happen to small brilliant startups.</p><h2>Increasing market share</h2><p>Acquiring a startup from a big company point of view can make the big one have the small company’s clients hence its market share will increase. That’s what happened when Uber acquired Careem for $3.1B to <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">expand the greater Middle East region</a></p><h2>Geographical diversification</h2><p>When a dominant company sees potential in a specific geographic region, it looks for a rising startup that has a strong chance of growth.</p><p>However, this is the riskiest reason for acquisition because of the differences in culture, management, marketing, and sales between the acquired company and the corporate.</p><p>Example: Amazon acquiring Souq.com (<a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">the biggest e-commerce player in the Middle East</a>) for $580M in cash</p><h2>Product diversification</h2><p>Companies develop their businesses by diversifying their products into new ones to expand their sales from new products and acquire new customers.</p><p>Examples: </p><ul role="list"><li>Acquiring Google to many small companies that are not in its primary market (search engines)</li><li>Facebook acquiring Oculus (the Virtual Reality company) as Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">reported</a>, “a new communication platform.”</li><li>Amazon acquiring Twitch (the video live streaming service)</li></ul><h2>Eliminating potential competition</h2><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram — the 13-employee company that time which had 15 million users. Acquired for 1 billion dollars.</p><p>Two years later, Facebook bought WhatsApp — a 50-employee company that had 450 million active users at that time. The acquisition was worth $19B!</p><p>Eliminating a potential competition for Facebook in the long-term was a big reason why the acquisitions for WhatsApp and Instagram happened. It’s quite intuitive that we use our phones, the more data the platform collects, so the more money!</p><p>On the other hand, Blockbuster — an 84,300-employee company in 2004 founded in 1987 which could have bought Netflix for $50 million but the CEO considered that as a joke. </p><p>Blockbuster had 400+ stores and was dominating in the video rental industry until Netflix left it behind and now Blockbuster has just 3 employees and 1 store in Dallas!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Reasons vary when a big firm acquires a startup whether to increase their market share, enter a new market region, diversify their products, or eliminate potential competition.</p><p>Whatever the reason is, it should always end up with high profitability to the acquirer in the long run and an instant revenue to the acquired one.</p><h2><a href="http://bit.ly/3mneyrK" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get fresh content to your inbox</h2><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/netflix-blockbuster-meeting-marc-randolph-reed-hastings-john-antioco.html" target="_blank">Blockbuster Could Have Bought Netflix for $50 Million, but the CEO Thought It Was a Joke</a></li><li><a href="https://ar.quora.com/%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA" target="_blank">لماذا تشتري الشركات الكبري الشركات الناشئة</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank">List of companies acquired by Google</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/" target="_blank">A Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn’t Sound So Crazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">Uber to Acquire Careem To Expand the Greater Middle East Regional Opportunity Together</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">The Real Reason Facebook Bought Oculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">Why Amazon Acquired Souq.com</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/amazon-souq-com-completed/" target="_blank">Amazon completes its acquisition of Middle Eastern e-commerce firm Souq</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-acquire-twitch" target="_blank">Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $970 Million — The Information</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC" target="_blank">Blockbuster | wiki</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gazprom-energy.co.uk/blog/diversifying-and-entering-new-markets-how-to-plan-for-success/" target="_blank">Diversifying and entering new markets: How to plan for success</a></li></ul><p>Published on my new medium publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-brainwave/why-big-companies-buy-small-ones-be95211b29a6?sk=bac17084562fedf6550f86504955921e">Brainwave</a>, make sure to follow it!<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

					<span>UPDATE JAN 24, 2021:</span><br>Over the weekend Moderna announced the release of lot number 013M20A, manufactured approximately January 21st (according to our estimate based on each lot's expiration date). For more on how we arrive at these estimates, see <em>Where The Data Comes From</em>, below.
					
					Moderna's U.S. COVID-19 vaccine delivery rate averaged 476,000 doses per day during the latter half of December, but has dropped substantially in the new year, currently averaging just 301,000 doses per day since January 1. To put this in perspective: the company would need to sustain a manufacturing rate of 1.1 <em>million</em> doses per day in order to fulfill its commitment to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March...a goal that currently looks unachievable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>TECH NOTE: A LOT OF TROUBLE</span><br>
					Moderna's vaccine lot number 041L20A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch">made the news</a> last week when a cluster of 6 vaccine recipients in San Diego developed severe allergic reactions, prompting the state of California to place a temporary hold on vaccinations using that lot. Moderna and the FDA are currently investigating the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					From our perspective as dose-trackers, that event provided both some new information <em>and</em> some additional uncertainty. Our estimates of the number of US doses delivered by Moderna hinge on our assumption regarding lot sizes - how many doses of vaccine bear the same lot number. We base our estimate of that number on <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">Moderna's own statement</a>, on January 4, that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date,"</em> plus its report of 26 lots delivered up to that time, enabling us to calculate an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the US government per lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week's news regarding lot 041L20A thus surprised us, when <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-california-department-public-health-cdph-report">Moderna revealed</a> that the lot in question comprised 1.27 million doses, of which 964,900 had been delivered to the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the moment we have chosen to stick with our initial estimate of an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the government per lot, rather than the number revealed this week for lot 041L20A (965,000 doses) because the former is based on the average of 26 lots, whereas the latter is based on a single lot. We will continue to monitor information from several sources, including Moderna itself, and may adjust our lot size estimate in future, as warranted by available evidence.

				<p>
					<span>WHY THE SLOWDOWN?</span><br>Moderna has not yet publicly discussed the dial-back in its U.S. manufacturing rate, so we're left to speculate. Our best guess is supply chain issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, Moderna's vaccine was produced exclusively by contract manufacturer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lonza.com/">Lonza</a> at its Portsmouth NH facility. But that changed this week when Lonza gained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-swiss/lonza-gets-swiss-ok-to-start-moderna-vaccine-production-paper-idUSKBN29808X">approval</a> from Switzerland's regulatory agency, Swissmedic, to begin manufacturing at its huge Visp, Switzerland facility as well. Lonza's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000023/lonzamodernagltafullye.htm">contract</a> with Moderna stipulates that <em>"In no event will LONZA or its Affiliates ship, or be instructed to ship, to the United States any Product Manufactured at any Facility outside of the United States."</em> That means that raw materials like the specialty lipids that go into Moderna's vaccine, which may be in short supply, are now needed by two facilities, only one of which makes vaccine for the U.S. market. The data we report here reflects only U.S. production.
				</p>
		
				<p><span>WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM:</span><br>Pharmaceutical companies normally treat their manufacturing data like state secrets, sharing them with the FDA only because they are required to, and even then only in strictest secrecy, out of the public eye. But these aren't normal times, and so the public has an unusual opportunity to track <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna Therapeutics</a>' COVID-19 vaccine production rate with unprecedented clarity.</p>
			
				<p>The company's RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, authorized by the FDA on December 20th of last year, was rushed to market long before the company knew for sure just how long the product's shelf life would be. At the time, ongoing testing had already established that its shelf life was <em>at least</em> 6 months, but still more testing would be required to reveal how much <em>longer</em> than that it might be safely stored before losing potency. That's a critical void in our knowledge for a vaccine that is America's best hope (so far) for stemming the pandemic that has already killed more than a third of a million Americans. So Moderna took the unusual step of printing no expiration dates on its vaccine vials, instead providing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/vial-lookup">a page on its web site</a> where pharmacists and other interested parties can search for a vial's lot number and learn the company's current best guess regarding its expiration date. That's helpful because the product's current six month shelf life is likely to be found in the near future to be considerably longer than that, so this web page enables the company to revise each production lot's expiration date as future data provides deeper insight.</p>
			
				<p>But that same expiration look-up page also (and apparently unwittingly) reveals to the educated eye everything we need to know in order to track Moderna's vaccine manufacturing pace <em>in real time</em>, eliminating our dependence on the company or the federal government for answers to the critical question of how rapidly it is is cranking out the life-saving vaccine doses that will ultimately bring this deadly pandemic to an end. When you type in a vaccine lot number and click the page's 'Submit' button, Moderna's web server (housed by Amazon Web Services) replies to that query with <a target="_blank" href="https://lnl-dl.s3.amazonaws.com/Moderna/expiry.json">a JSON file</a> listing every lot of vaccine the company has released so far, along with each lot's current expiration date. Back-calculating from that expiry date, using the current 6-month shelf life figure for the vaccine, thus enables us to determine each lot's manufacturing date. And finally, we know how many doses an average lot of vaccine includes, based on the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">January 4th announcement</a> that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date."</em> The company had produced 26 lots of vaccine in the U.S. by that date, thus allowing us to calculate that an average production lot amounts to about 692,000 doses.</p>

<p>The Embroidered Computer is an exploration into using historic gold embroidery materials and knowledge to craft a programmable 8 bit computer.<br>
Solely built from a variety of metal threads, magnetic, glas and metal beads, and being inspired by traditional crafting routines and patterns, the piece questions the appearance of current digital and electronic technologies surrounding us, as well as our interaction with them.</p>
<p>Technically, the piece consists of (textile) relays, similar to early computers before the invention of semiconductors. Visually, the gold materials, here used for their conductive properties, arranged into specific patterns to fulfill electronic functions, dominate the work. Traditionally purely decorative, their&nbsp;pattern here defines they function. They lay bare core digital routines usually hidden in black boxes. Users are invited to interact with the piece in programming the textile to compute for them.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Dan Luu has been trying for months to persuade me that I should start a paid newsletter so that I can spend more time researching and writing interesting things. He hardly ever even mentions the existence of his own <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu/posts">private patreon posts</a> and still manages to make decent pocket money out of them, so this doesn't seem like an unreasonable idea.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of writing that mostly just gets sent to friends or left to rot on my hard drive. When I get around to turning something into a blog post it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.net">tends to end up on the Hacker News front page</a>. It still seems kind of crazy to me that anyone might want to pay for my writing, but it also used to seem crazy to me that people would pay for my code. Maybe I'm just not very good at capitalism.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give this a go - any <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii">github sponsors</a> at any tier will get access to all the new posts. Using github instead of substack is maybe a weird choice, but I want to be able to embed katex and interactive demos in the posts and provide code alongside for examples and case studies. I also expect to be releasing more open-source software this year as a side-effect of doing less consulting.</p>

<p>Here are the kinds of things that I might be working on and writing about this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big projects 
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/">A practical relational query compiler in 500 lines of code</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">A UI library for a relational language</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/julia-as-a-platform-for-language-development/">Julia as a platform for language development</a>, <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/reltron/">A UI for exploring relational databases</a></li>
<li>Designing a database query language that supports abstraction. An <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">ongoing</a> project which is 80% done and just needs a sustained slog to finish the last 80% and produce a clear writeup and demo.</li>
<li>Building a text editor from scratch. An <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus">existing project</a>, already in daily use. Posts will start with absolute basics (eg how to render simple UI in opengl) and eventually catch up to ongoing development (currently working on editing 1gb files at 60 fps without dropping frames).</li>
<li>Benchmarking streaming systems. A new project for 2021. Existing streaming benchmarks suffer from problems like <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-01-15.md">measuring how well they can parallelize the overhead they added to the original problem</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md">mostly measuring distributed json de/serialization</a> or even just <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html">quietly ignoring pauses</a>. I want to figure out how to measure these systems correctly, begin to map out the space of engineering tradeoffs and try to extract some lessons for designers of future systems.</li>
<li>Building an embedabble relational database with incrementally maintained views. Another new project for 2021. An attempt to place the ideas from <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> into a <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-isnt-differential-dataflow-more-popular/">more accessible</a> form.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Reading

<li>Literature reviews, mostly focused on databases, query languages, query planning (especially in streaming systems), compilers, incremental view maintenance, self-adjusting computation</li>
<li>Book summaries. I <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/notes.html">used to publish</a> summaries of everything I read.

I expect to be informative when talking about those subjects, and at least entertaining when talking about other subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the posts will also be published on this blog. Others will be exclusive to the newsletter. I expect the schedule to consist of bursts of activity interspersed with weeks of frustrated silence.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but this is one of the most frightening things I've done in years. I can only see that as a good sign.</p>

The quality and completeness of data has greatly improved at TMDB over the years and we think with some re-alignment of community resources, it can work really well as Trakt’s primary TV data source.</p><p id="4e87">What it really boils down to is a moral opposition to taking in data from a community and then trying to sell it back to them. We believe when a user contributes to an online data source, they mean for that work to be shared with everyone around them. Both TMDB and Trakt have open and free APIs for developers to build upon that hard work.</p><p id="fded">TVDB is enforcing a commercial paid model to get access to their community moderated data. The first option is a commercial agreement with an app directly, but we’ve heard TVDB is asking for unrealistic licensing fees compared to an app’s revenue. The second option is charging users directly to access TVDB data. That doesn’t really work either, since that means an app is dependent on users paying a 3rd party service to work.</p><ol><li id="938a">New TV shows are imported using TMDB as their data source <em>(all new shows since November 2020 already use TMDB)</em></li><li id="5713">When we do nightly data refreshes, we compare TMDB with TVDB to determine if the seasons and episodes match up. <em>(we’ve gathered data on over 20,000 shows since November 2020)</em></li><li id="9fe3">We created a <a href="https://trakt.tv/transition/tmdb/updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>comparison page</strong></a> for TMDB and TVDB data.

It helps Trakt and the thousands of other apps that use metadata from both sources.</p><p id="e53b">We need your help to ensure TMDB data is complete and ready for the transition.

      <p>January 24, 2021</p>
      <p>Clubhouse is moving quickly today, but in some ways it feels like the journey started a long time ago. The two of us met back in 2011 through a mutual friend, and we connected over a shared love of social products. Back then, Rohan had been working on ways to help friends find each other in cities, and Paul was building an app called Highlight to help people form friendships with others around them. Over the next ten years we both kept working on social products—experimenting with new apps, failing, and starting again.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, we reconnected over some work that Rohan was doing to help his daughter Lydia, who was born with a rare genetic disease, and eventually that reconnection led to us finally teaming up to work together. Against our better judgment, and with the support of two very patient spouses, we decided to give social apps one last try.</p>
      <p>After a lot of iteration in the audio space, we launched Clubhouse in March of last year. Our goal was to build a social experience that felt more human—where instead of posting, you could gather with other people and talk. Our north star was to create something where you could close the app at the end of the session feeling better than you did when you opened it, because you had deepened friendships, met new people and learned.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Unlike our other attempts, Clubhouse seemed to strike a real chord with people, and it has accelerated quickly over the past ten months—from a small handful of beta testers into a diverse and growing network of communities. This past week, two million people around the world—musicians, scientists, creators, athletes, comedians, parents, entrepreneurs, stock traders, non-profit leaders, authors, artists, real estate agents, sports fans and more—came to Clubhouse to talk, learn, laugh, be entertained, meet and connect. It’s the most exciting thing we’ve ever been a part of.</p>
      <p>The thing we love most is how voice can bring people together. No matter where you live in the world or what networks you have access to, in Clubhouse you can be in the room—often with people whose lived experience has been very different from your own. In one of the most turbulent and troubled years many of us have experienced, people on Clubhouse have come together for important and nuanced conversations on topics of social justice reform, BLM and anti-racism. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, room after room filled the hallways with people discussing constitutional law, sharing stories about RBG’s childhood, and praying in silence together. Each week, parents of children with genetic diseases gather in Clubhouse to discuss medical developments with doctors, researchers and other parents—talking, debating and learning.</p>
      <p>We’ve also been blown away by the brilliance and creativity of the Clubhouse community. Each night in Clubhouse, there are now thousands of rooms filled with people hosting game shows, recapping NBA games, singing opera, discussing philosophy, meeting other musicians, sharing travel tips, running support groups, and meditating together. They’re hosting daily talk shows, performing standup comedy, playing guitar and giving history lectures. In December, forty strangers who met on Clubhouse auditioned, rehearsed, and hosted a full-blown musical production for thousands of people that made national headlines. They are creating entirely new ways for people to come together, all through the power of voice.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Our focus now is on opening up Clubhouse to the whole world. With that goal in mind for 2021, we have secured a new round in funding, led by Andrew Chen at a16z, who also led our Series A. It’s always been important to us to have investors who care deeply about diversity, and who will work hard to help us make Clubhouse a welcoming and inclusive community. We now have over 180 investors in Clubhouse—large and small, spanning many different races, genders, and areas of expertise, and including many members of our early community. While we’ve never felt that fundraising itself is a milestone, we wanted to share how we plan to use these funds to make the product better each day and to help creators on Clubhouse thrive:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcoming more amazing people 🎉</strong> &nbsp; From the earliest days, we’ve wanted to build Clubhouse for everyone. With this in mind, we are thrilled to begin work on our Android app soon, and to add more accessibility and localization features so that people all over the world can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping the servers up 👩🏽‍💻</strong> &nbsp; We’ve grown faster than expected over the past few months, causing too many people to see red error messages when our servers are struggling. A large portion of the new funding round will go to technology and infrastructure to scale the Clubhouse experience for everyone, so that it’s always fast and performant, regardless of how many people are joining.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensuring you get fast support ⚡️</strong> &nbsp; User safety has always been a top priority for us, and as we welcome more people, it will remain one. This means scaling up our Trust &amp; Safety and Support teams as we grow, continuing to invest in advanced tools to detect and prevent abuse, and increasing the features and training resources available to moderators. We’ll also be aggressively growing our support team so that everyone’s clubs can get same-day approval. :)</li>
          <li><strong>Improving ranking and discovery 🌍</strong> &nbsp; As we’ve grown, the number of conversations happening on Clubhouse has skyrocketed, and it’s our job to help you find the right ones each time you open the app. With this new round of funding we’ll be investing heavily in discovery so that we can show you people, clubs, and rooms that are perfectly tailored to your interests—and help you discover new rooms you never would have thought to look for.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in creators 👨🏽‍🎤</strong> &nbsp; Creators are the lifeblood of Clubhouse, and we want to make sure that all of the amazing people who host conversations for others are getting recognized for their contributions. Over the next few months, we plan to launch our first tests to allow creators to get paid directly—through features like tipping, tickets or subscriptions. We will also be using a portion of the new funding round to roll out a Creator Grant Program to support emerging Clubhouse creators.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>We know we have said this before, but we are so incredibly grateful to everyone who has joined Clubhouse, given us their feedback during Town Halls, shared their stories, and been part of the journey so far. We built Clubhouse to be a blank canvas filled with amazing people, and it is nothing without the incredible people who fill the rooms each day.</p>
      <p>We’re working hard to scale Clubhouse as fast as we can and open it up to everyone soon. In the meantime, anyone can join with an invite from an existing user, or sign up for the <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">waitlist</a> so we can welcome you in soon. We are also <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/joinclubhouse" target="_blank">hiring in all areas</a>, so if you are excited about our mission, we would love to talk with you.</p>
      <p>Thank you again. It means so much to us to be able to build this product for you, and we’re so excited for this next chapter.</p>
      <p>- Paul, Rohan and the Clubhouse team</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The “Fediverse” is a loose aggregation of federated servers that mainly speak the ActivityPub protocol. One of the most famous services in the Fediverse is “Mastodon.” We joined the Fediverse in the early days of Mastodon to share short-lived information that didn’t fit into a separate article on our website.</p><h2 id="the-issues-that-we-discussed-earlier-this-year">The issues that we discussed earlier this year</h2><p>In May, <a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-05-31-monthly-review/#fediverse">we reconsidered our presence in the Fediverse</a>. Back then, the main issues for us were:</p><ol><li>You can’t migrate your posts if you need to migrate to another Mastodon server.</li><li>You can’t update your posts without losing shares and comments.</li><li>All posts have a character limit, so we can’t say everything we want in a single post.</li><li>Many Fediverse users claim to be the “better and open-minded alternative to Twitter.” We think that this doesn’t reflect reality, as explained below.</li></ol><p>In June, we addressed issues 1 to 3 by introducing a “News” section on our website.</p><h2 id="further-issues-in-the-fediverse-and-other-social-networks">Further issues in the Fediverse and other social networks</h2><p>We also participated in discussions and tried to encourage dialogs in the Fediverse and other forums instead of only posting information. However, these discussions revealed consistent issues:</p><h3 id="the-toxic-us-vs-them-ideology">The toxic “us vs. them” ideology</h3><p>For some groups, it is vital to make a bogeyman out of opposing parties. In the Fediverse, some individuals and groups continuously spread misinformation about “the others” to gain likes and followers. While most of the toxic behavior targets the big tech companies in the USA, some individuals targetting us.</p><h3 id="the-reverse-burden-of-proof">The “reverse burden of proof”</h3><p>When discussing with others, we often encountered the “reverse burden of proof.” Somebody posts negative claims about a product or service. Instead of providing (technical) proof for the claim, the only supporting “fact” is, “everybody knows that this is true.” On the contrary, this person doesn’t accept any (technical) proof that debunks their initial claim. For us, it looks like you don’t need to provide any real facts as long as you satisfy the ideology of some people.</p><h3 id="the-i-read-headlines-only-problem">The “I read headlines only” problem</h3><p>Many people read the headlines of a post and then guess what is written in the remaining article. Such behavior results in misinterpreted information and persistent myths. On the other hand, it became a standard tool for some blogs to gain more readers: Writing, “Critical security vulnerability could leak all of your data” results in more clicks and shares than, “Company fixed potential security vulnerability months ago, which could have leaked some of your data if ever exploited.” This problem kills meaningful discussions instantly.</p><h3 id="the-security-and-privacy-by-assumption-problem">The “security and privacy by assumption” problem</h3><p>Most of you know “security by obscurity,” when security relies on keeping the implementation secret. We see another common issue: “security and privacy by assumption.” Many people share security and privacy tips without ever checking whether these tips work. They just assume that somebody else checked it before.</p><h3 id="and-finally-comparing-apples-to-oranges">And finally, “comparing apples to oranges”</h3><p>For instance, some people claim the Signal messenger became insecure after introducing the Signal PIN because a server-side attacker could now access your data. The base for this claim is the assumption that a server-side party extracts encrypted information from the volatile main memory of a server, exploits an unpatched security vulnerability in Intel CPUs to extract a key, and successfully guesses a user-provided password.</p><p>While the attack looks anything but trivial as these people describe it, they then argue that their favorite messenger is far more secure due to being decentralized. They compare the encryption mechanism of instant messenger A with something else. Suppose you look at the same feature of their favorite messenger. In that case, you see that their messenger doesn’t offer any server-side protection. In their case, a server-side party can directly access your data in cleartext—this is trivial.</p><h3 id="im-privacy-friendly-please-donate">“I’m privacy-friendly; please donate”</h3><p>The issues mentioned above are also prevalent on other social networks like Twitter. Just like on Twitter, you see “privacy-friendly” companies trying to gain more paying customers or some bloggers heavily involved in influencer marketing. While most of them claim that this is for a “good cause,” it is ultimately all about money.</p><h3 id="decentralization-still-isnt-a-privacy-feature">Decentralization still isn’t a privacy feature</h3><p>Now, some people may insist that at least security and privacy are far better “due to the decentralized nature” of the Fediverse. As we wrote several times before, “decentralization” isn’t a privacy feature.</p><p>Search engines like Google can discover and index all of your public posts in the Fediverse. By default, you can see the social graphs of all accounts, as followers are public. Especially Mastodon servers come with privacy policies that don’t meet the European GDPR requirements. Many (Mastodon) servers seem to run an outdated version, indicating inadequate security practices.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Should you become part of the Fediverse by creating an account? It isn’t up to us to decide this, of course.</p><p>If you only want to read the content of others, we recommend subscribing to their RSS feeds. Your RSS subscriptions are private and more decentralized than any Fediverse account. And you need to manage one account less on the internet.</p><p>If you want to be an active part of the Fediverse, be prepared for the same problems as on any other social network. We decided to leave the Fediverse for now.</p><h2>Read also</h2><ul><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-12-20-contact-and-feed/">On contacting us, and subscribing to our RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-11-08-rss-update/">Update of our RSS/Atom feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-02-tls-insights/">TLS usage of InfoSec Handbook readers</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-01-introducing-the-news-section/">Introducing the 'News' section</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The words media outlets use to describe events play a large role in shaping public perception of those events. As January 6 unfolded on Capitol Hill, there was a rapid shift in language, from “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protesters</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0112/How-a-mob-stormed-the-Capitol-and-how-to-stop-another-assault" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>supporters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-helped-organize-the-pro-trump-rally-before-the-capitol-siege-but-they-probably-wont-suffer-any-consequences-153271" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rally</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress-combat-veteran-military-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>siege</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-firefighter-robert-sanford-arrested-for-allegedly-hurling-fire-extinguisher-at-cops-during-capitol-riots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rioters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/08/1015929/archive-capitol-insurrection-trump-maga-footage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>insurrection</span></a>.” These choices — on the day of the attack and in its aftermath — matched the descent of a seemingly peaceful protest into a violent and dangerous attack on the seat of the U.S. federal government.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Using 5,057 article titles about the Capitol Riot from 398 sources across the political spectrum, The Factual examined how the events and aftermath of January 6 are most commonly described in U.S. and global media. This includes the differences in language between left- and right-leaning publications, as well as how the terminology used compares to <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: An article’s title is not always a perfect representation of its content, but titles matter deeply in shaping readers’ perceptions of what media outlets are writing, whether there are contrasting views between political parties, and whether/how an event matters — especially in the social media era.</em></p>
<h4><strong>The Words Used to Describe January 6</strong></h4>
<p>The U.S. media ecosystem includes hundreds of outlets, reflecting the myriad ideologies, political alignments, and niche areas of interest that motivate the American populace. They help define the core issues that drive American political and social discourse, and the words they use are central to how Americans understand current events. It should be no surprise, then, that the ways the media talks about the events of January 6 are key to building a consensus about what happened and unpacking how such an event may impact the U.S. going forward.</p>
<p>While there are some clear differences in the way the left and right talk about the Capitol Riot, instances of agreement are a good place to start. For example, there seems to be broad consensus that January 6 constituted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-report-before-capitol-breach-warned-congress-itself-could-be-targeted" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>riot</span></a>, not something less intense like a <a href="https://theprint.in/world/terrorism-or-protest-how-the-us-media-saw-the-siege-of-the-capitol/582443/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protest</span></a> or something more intense like a <a href="https://theconversation.com/was-it-a-coup-no-but-siege-on-us-capitol-was-the-election-violence-of-a-fragile-democracy-152803" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>coup</span></a>. Around 40% of article titles from both left-leaning (41.3%) and right-leaning (38.2%) outlets in our sample used the term “riot.” While the term “protest” was twice as likely to appear in titles from the right, the term appeared in just 5.5% of all articles, demonstrating that the term was inadequate to capture the day’s events. Meanwhile, “rally,” the purported nature of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-the-steal-organizer-gop-members-helped-him-plan-rally-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pro-Trump gatherings</span></a> prior to the riot, appeared in just 1.2% of titles.</p>

<p>Other words were used with roughly similar frequency regardless of the publisher’s political bias. Reporting from across the political spectrum mentions “violent” or “violence,” “siege,” and “police” about the same amount, reflecting at least a partial shared understanding of the lengthy clashes between police and the numerous rioters. Further, just 16 of the 5,057 article titles included the word “peaceful.”</p>

<p>A third of article titles on the left (33%) and a quarter of those on the right (26%) mention Trump, highlighting a shared understanding of his proximity to the events of January 6.

<div><p>Language also varied when discussing the behavior of the rioters.

<div><p>Overall, these differences in terminology reflect the political landscape in the aftermath of January 6 in two ways: (1) a central consensus clearly labels the event as a riot and shares some broad interpretations of the day’s events, and (2) on average, left-leaning interpretations accentuate the violent, seditious nature of events while right-leaning publications take a softer tone.</p></div>
<h4><strong>How These Words Compare to the George Floyd Protests</strong></h4>
<p>Just as many saw fundamentally different responses to the George Floyd protests and the Capitol Riot, The Factual’s data reveals a few differences in the way these events were described in the media. (This analysis uses an <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>earlier study</span></a> we conducted based on a similarly sized dataset of 4,958 article titles from the 10 days following George Floyd’s killing.)</p>
<p>Most prominently, the George Floyd protests were far more likely to be described using the word “protest” (44.9%) and far less likely to involve “riot” (2.9%) than the Capitol Riot. The events on Capitol Hill were 10 times as likely to be described as an “attack,” while the George Floyd protests were 5 times more likely to be described as “peaceful.” This makes intuitive sense since the George Floyd protests encompass hundreds of separate events and were <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>93% peaceful</span></a>. The Capitol Riot, on the other hand, refers specifically to a single event where numerous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/injured-police-officers-were-evacuated-from-capitol-hill-protests-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent incidents</span></a> took place. Importantly, however, this highlights that efforts to equate the Capitol Riot with the George Floyd protests — for whatever purpose — are of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>limited use</span></a>.</p>

<p>There is also generally more agreement between left- and right-leaning outlets about what terminology to use to describe the Capitol Riot. <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests showed larger divergences between left and right, for example, in terms of usage of “protest” or “riot”:</p>
<p>[A]rticles from outlets on the right featured “riot,” “riots,” or “rioting” in 12.9% of all article titles, while only 2.6% of article titles on the left featured those terms. Similarly, article titles on the right were twice as likely (8.1%) to use some variation of the word “loot” than the left (3.8%). Conversely, articles on the left were 10% more likely (43.7%) to feature a variation of the term “protest” than those on the right (33.8%), and 7.8% of articles on the left featured the term “non-violent,” which didn’t appear in any article titles on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Trump played a prominent role during the George Floyd protests, particularly relating to his use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>federal forces</span></a> like the National Guard, he was in retrospect a secondary player in the national upheaval over institutional racism and police brutality; he was mentioned in 9.4% of article titles from that period. By contrast, he was three times as likely to be mentioned in titles related to the Capitol Riot (31.1%). Conversely, the police were mentioned repeatedly during the George Floyd protests (40.5%), unsurprising given their centrality to the upheaval, but were mentioned with less frequency in relation to the Capitol Riot. Despite their varied interactions both <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-failed-to-contain-a-riot-then-killed-a-woman-in-the-chaos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fighting</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/capitol-police-chief-several-officers-suspended-siege" rel="noopener" target="_blank">assisting</a> the rioters, “police” only appeared in 10.9% of all articles related to the events in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>A further way media coverage has differed is through the words that fail to appear in coverage of the events on Capitol Hill. For example, instances of looting during this summer’s protests were used by some to try to delegitimize the entire Black Lives Matter movement. In our sample about the George Floyd protests, “looting” — to "steal goods from (a place), typically during a war or riot"<span>&nbsp;—</span> was mentioned in 3.4% of article titles, slightly more than the 2.9% of articles that mentioned “riot.” By contrast, though 39.1% of article titles about January 6 included the word “riot” and even as assailants broke into the Capitol building, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/08/clyburns-ipad-laptop-from-pelosis-office-items-stolen-destroyed-in-capitol-attack/?sh=37d9d46d5963" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stole government property</span></a>, and evidence was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/9/horned-man-west-va-lawmaker-man-holding-pelosis-le/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>widely published</span></a> of them doing so, there wasn’t a single mention of “looting” in the 5,057 article titles in our sample.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h4><strong>How Far Apart</strong></h4>
<p>Regardless of the words one uses to describe the political division in the U.S., it is apparent that there is some distance between the left and right on the future of the country, the optimal direction for policy, and especially how to think about the last four years. However, the words used to describe the Capitol Riot suggest more unity than one might expect, at least in terms of the media’s portrayal of what will likely be the most memorable day of the Trump administration. Media coverage from across the political spectrum is certainly in greater agreement about the character of events in DC than it was about the George Floyd protests this summer. If the desire is to rein in partisan division, coming to a set of common terms to describe the events of January 6 is a good start.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the fifth pre-release of Nyxt version 2.0.0. If you missed the previous pre-release announcement, see <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/release-2-pre-release-4.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nyxt 2 is a massive overhaul of the Nyxt 1 series. A lot of effort has been geared towards improving the code quality under the hood which should reflect on the overall user experience with better performance, increased stability and better accessibility.</p>
<p>This is a test release for everyone to try out before the final release. It contains experimental features and some parts are still unfinished. Please feel free to share your feedback on our <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>!</p>
<p>Notable highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added a dashboard function to Nyxt. It can be used as a startup-buffer. It can display display recent URLs, bookmarks, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>reduce-to-buffer</code> includes a summary of each buffer (powered by our Text Rank implementation).</p></li>
<li><p>Improved <code>buffer-history-tree</code> presentation. It is now easier to visualize the tree as there are lines drawn between nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>analysis</code> library:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add support for DBSCAN algorithm. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm used to classify vectors as being related.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve Text Rank algorithm implementation. This results in better summarization.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For the complete change list, please consult the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-5/documents/CHANGELOG.org#2-pre-release-5">CHANGELOG.org</a> file.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy these new features, and that they help make you more productive. Thanks for reading :-)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Postgresql is my favorite relational database. There are a lot of cool things that Postgresql can do and one of those is to handle the authorization layer. Some people argue that putting authorization logic into the database makes the application code harder to read, and that’s actually true if there is only 1 code base connecting to a database. However, if there are more than 1 code bases communicating with a database, having a centralized authorization logic starts to make more sense. In this blog post, I am not going to discuss the pros and cons of having the authorization logic inside the database, but instead I am going to describe how I put all my authorization logic into postgresql.</p>
<p>This blog post assumes that you have prior knowledge about postgresql and SQL in general.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts<a href="#basic-concepts" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>There are some basic concepts that we need to know before continuing</p>
<h3 id="role">Role<a href="#role" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>A role in postgresql can mean many things. It can be an user, a group of users. I usually think role as a group of users. For example, in a forum, there are normal users, moderators and admins. A new role can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrole.html">CREATE ROLE</a>. For example</p>
<p>Then, to change the role of the current connection, simply call</p>
<h3 id="table-privileges">Table privileges<a href="#table-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>In postgresql, we can control which role can access which table. This is done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> <span>admin</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows admin to do ALL operations on <code>forum</code> tables.</p>
<h3 id="column-privileges">Column privileges<a href="#column-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Next we have column privileges. These are more granular and for controlling how roles can access columns in a table. This is also done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(name) <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> anonymous;
</code></pre></div><p>This restricts <code>anonymous</code> role from accessing other columns in <code>forum</code> than <code>name</code>. So doing <code>SELECT * FROM forum</code> will return an error.</p>
<h3 id="row-level-security">Row-level security<a href="#row-level-security" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This is the lowest (and most powerful) level that controls the access to a specific row. This is called <code>policy</code> in postgresql and can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createpolicy.html">CREATE POLICY</a>. However, row-level security is not enabled by default, so we need to manually enable it if we want to use it</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> forum ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Row-level security is a bit more complicated subject. For the sake of this post, I am not going to explain every bit of the syntax but instead just show the queries and explain what they do.</p>
<p>A policy is tied to a role, and defines what that role can do (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT) to a row. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY moderator_can_update_forum <span>ON</span> forum  
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span>(<span>current_user</span> <span>=</span> <span>'moderator'</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>moderator</code> to do <code>UPDATE</code> operations, all other roles can’t do that if not specifically set so. However, <code>moderator</code> still needs to be granted <code>UPDATE</code> on <code>forum</code> table</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> moderator;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting everything together<a href="#putting-everything-together" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I am going to design a database schema for a simple project where you can create your own store and display some products on your store. Here is the database schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> account (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  username VARCHAR(<span>32</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  password TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  phone_number TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  <span>role</span> VARCHAR(<span>16</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
);

<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> unique_username <span>UNIQUE</span>(username);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> store ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> product (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>128</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  stock INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>0</span>,
  description TEXT,
  store_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> store(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> product ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to have some roles for the project</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> store_owner;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> normal_account;

<span>GRANT</span> normal_account <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> store_owner <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>normal_account</code> is … just a normal account in our app</li>
<li><code>store_owner</code> is the creator of a store. So for the sake of simplicity, any normal account who created a store is automatically promoted to a <code>store_owner</code></li>
<li><code>super_admin</code> can basically do anything, it’s usually us who manages the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 <code>GRANT</code> queries establish a chain of privileges, <code>store_owner</code> can do anything that <code>normal_account</code> can do. And <code>super_admin</code> can do anything that <code>store_user</code> can do. In reality, it might be possible to have a deeper user role hierarchy.</p>
<p>Now, let’s define the permissions for each role. Let’s do it for <code>normal_account</code> and <code>store_owner</code> because <code>super_admin</code> can do absolutely anything. In addition to explicitly define the permissions for <code>super_admin</code>, I can also set <code>BYPASSRLS</code> when creating the role in order to bypass all the row-level security.</p>
<h3 id="account">account<a href="#account" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>For this table, no one can INSERT or DELETE except <code>super_admin</code> and since <code>store_owner</code> is also a <code>normal_account</code>, let’s define what a <code>normal_account</code> can do.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>normal_account</code> to SELECT and UPDATE all columns in <code>account</code> table. But it’s not enough, we must limit it so that an account can only UPDATE their own data and not everyone else’s. For SELECT, we probably want the same limitation because leaking other people data is obviously bad.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_update_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (is_current_account(id));
</code></pre></div><p>The 2 queries are straightforward, we have just created 2 policies in <code>account</code> table to control the visibility of its rows. The only new bit here is <code>is_current_account(id)</code> function. First, let’s take a look at its source code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> is_current_account(account_id integer)
<span>RETURNS</span> BOOLEAN
<span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>DECLARE</span>
  current_account_id INT;
  owner_id INT;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> current_setting(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, <span>true</span>)::int <span>INTO</span> current_account_id;
  <span>RETURN</span> current_account_id <span>=</span> account_id;
<span>END</span>;
<span>$$</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> plpgsql;
</code></pre></div><p>For those who don’t like <code>plpgsql</code>, you can switch to Javascript to write stored procedures using this extension <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">https://github.com/plv8/plv8</a>. For this blog post, I will stick to the default language.</p>
<p>This simple function checks if the provided value (account_id) matches the current account id stored in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting (Need to have some prefix, or postgresql will try to set the server config). This leads to the next point: <strong>How do we set the current account in postgresql?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to do that, you can have a simple function <code>login(username, password)</code> to select the account matched the provided username and compare the password, just like a regular login flow. Then if everything is correct, set the role and store the account id in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting through this query</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> set_config(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, account.id::text, <span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Set the last parameter to <code>true</code> to apply this config for the current transaction, and <code>false</code> for the current session. This value depends on your application layer’s logic. The 2nd parameter needs to be a string because of the function signature.</p>
<p>In reality, we <strong>SHOULD AVOID</strong> setting an actual (id) value to <code>current_account_id</code>. There should be some kind of encryption so that people can’t just call <code>set_config</code> and bypass the login process.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the sake of simplicity, I will just manually set the role, and <code>current_account_id</code> to whatever I want in order to demonstrate the permission system.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we need to allow <code>super_admin</code> to do anything in <code>account</code> table, simply pass <code>true</code> to USING and WITH CHECK.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>INSERT</span>, <span>DELETE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> super_admin
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>)
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (<span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Then, there is one last thing which is to allow <code>admin</code> to use the primary key (id) sequence. Without this, <code>admin</code> won’t be able to generate the next id to be used as the primary key for the new row.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> account_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="store">store<a href="#store" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Our <code>store</code> table has the following schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
</code></pre></div><p>Assuming that <code>rank</code> is only visible to the <code>store_owner</code>, we have these GRANT queries. And <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE name and description. The column <code>rank</code> could be something we do in a background job to let store owners know how well their store is doing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(id, name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(rank, owner_id) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span>(name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><p>Similar to <code>account</code> table, we still need to have some policies. <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the stores and <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE their own store. Also, <code>super_admin</code> can do anything here as well.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_everything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>);

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY store_owner_can_update_their_store <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(owner_id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>)
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (<span>true</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>However, there is one problem with this table, we don’t want one store owner to see the rank of another store. With our role hierarchy, <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the rows which means that <code>store_owner</code> can also SELECT all the rows (including the <code>rank</code> column).</p>
<p>We can’t revoke access to <code>rank</code> column because we still want the store owner to see their own rank. And postgresql doesn’t support anything to “hide” a column value.</p>
<p>The only solution I can come up with to deal with this limitation is to move <code>rank</code> to another table, say, <code>store_rank</code> and we can apply row level security there to only allow the store owner to SELECT their rank.</p>
<h3 id="product">product<a href="#product" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Our <code>product</code> table has the following schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>T…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working with React since 2016 and still there isn’t a single best practice when it comes to application structure and design.</p>
<p>While there are best practices on the micro level, most teams build their own “thing” when it comes to architecture.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn’t a universal best practice that can be applied to all businesses and applications. But there are some general rules that we can follow to build a productive codebase.</p>
<p>The purpose of a software’s architecture and design is to keep it productive and flexible. Developers need to work on it effectively and modify it without rewriting its core.</p>
<p>This article is a collection of principles and rules that have proven to be effective for me and the teams I’ve worked with.</p>
<p>I outline good practices about components, application structure, testing, styling, state management and data fetching. Some of the examples are oversimplified so we can focus on the principle not on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Take everything here as an opinion</strong>, not an absolute. There’s more than one way to build software.</p>

<p>Favor functional components - they have a simpler syntax. No lifecycle methods, constructors or boilerplate. You can express the same logic with less characters without losing readability.</p>
<p>Unless you need an error boundary they should be your go-to approach. The mental model you need to keep in your head is a lot smaller.</p>

<h3 id="write-consistent-components">Write Consistent Components <a href="#write-consistent-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Stick to the same style for your components. Put helper functions in the same place, export the same way and follow the same naming patterns.</p>
<p>There isn’t a real benefit of one approach over the other</p>
<p>No matter if you’re exporting at the bottom of the file or directly in the definition of the component, pick one and stick to it.</p>
<h3 id="name-components">Name Components <a href="#name-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Always name your components. It helps when you’re reading an error stack trace and using the React Dev Tools.</p>
<p>It’s also easier to find where you are when developing if the component’s name is inside the file.</p>

<p>Helper functions that don’t need to hold a closure over the components should be moved outside. The ideal place is before the component definition so the file can be readable from top to bottom.</p>
<p>That reduces the noise in the component and leaves inside only those that need to be there.</p>

<h3 id="component-length">Component Length <a href="#component-length">#</a></h3>
<p>A React component is just a function that gets props and returns markup. They adhere to the same software design principles.</p>
<p>If a function is doing too many things, extract some of the logic and call another function. It’s the same with components - if you have too much functionality, split it in smaller components and call them instead.</p>
<p>If a part of the markup is complex, requires loops and conditionals - extract it.</p>
<p>Rely on props and callbacks for communication and data. Lines of code are not an objective measure. Think about responsibilities and abstractions instead.</p>

<p>when something needs more clarity open a code block and give additional information. The markup is a part of the logic so when you feel that something needs more clarity - provide it.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<h3 id="use-error-boundaries">Use Error Boundaries <a href="#use-error-boundaries">#</a></h3>
<p>An error in one component shouldn’t bring down the entire UI. There are rare cases in which we want to take down the whole page or redirect if a critical error happens. Most of the times we’d be fine if we just hide a specific element from the screen.</p>
<p>In a function that deals with data you may have multiple try/catch statements. Put error boundaries to use not just on the top level. Wrap elements on the screen that can exist separately to avoid cascading failures.</p>

<h3 id="destructure-props">Destructure Props <a href="#destructure-props">#</a></h3>
<p>Most React components are just functions. They get props and return markup. In a normal function you use the arguments it is passed directly, so it makes sense to apply the same principle here. No need to repeat <code>props</code> everywhere.</p>
<p>A reason not to destructure the props would be to distinguish what is external and what is internal state. But in a regular function there is no distinction between arguments and variables. Don’t create unnecessary patterns.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-props">Number of Props <a href="#number-of-props">#</a></h3>
<p>The question of how many props should a component receive is a subjective one. The number of props that a component has is correlated to how much it’s doing. The more props you pass to it the more responsibilities it has.</p>
<p>A high number of props is a signal that a component is doing too much.</p>
<p>If I go above 5 props I consider whether this component should be split. In some cases, it may just need a lot of data. An input field, for example, may have a lot of props. In others it’s a sign that something needs to be extracted.</p>
<p>Note: The more props a component takes, the more reasons to rerender.</p>
<h3 id="objects-instead-of-primitives">Pass Objects Instead of Primitives <a href="#objects-instead-of-primitives">#</a></h3>
<p>One way to limit the amount of props is to pass an object instead of primitive values. Rather than passing down the user name, email and settings one by one you can group them together. This also …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Recently I read a post which said that the White House official website will be now powered by WordPress.</p>
<p>I was playing with a static site generator called Hexo, I even created my own theme for it, before I switched to WordPress.</p>
<h2><strong>Static</strong> <strong>site</strong> <strong>generator</strong>s are <strong>hard</strong> </h2>
<p>Yes, playing with a static site generator is fun. You can learn to create something, you can customize and build your own theme.</p>
<p>But for an average user it’s a pain. Writing content is pain, you have to use markdown, you have to use some YAML syntax. An average user does not want to learn another language to write content. They just want to write and publish.</p>
<p>As much as I love making new things, I just want to write and focus on what’s important to me. Not meddling with MD and YAML, especially when I write a long post.</p>
<h2>Can WordPress handle traffic?</h2>
<p>When my blog first hit the front page of hacker news, I got bit afraid. I thought it will crash.</p>
<p>I’m using a shared hosting for this blog after all. However, it stood very well. I’m passing my WordPress though CloudFlare and using a caching plugin and it stood well against the traffic of hacker news.</p>
<h2>Is WordPress safe?</h2>
<p>No software can be 100% safe, even the modules you are using for your JavaScript projects can have security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>So even though WordPress can too have vulnerabilities, the WordPress core is pretty stable. You have to worry about the plug-ins that you chose to install.</p>
<p>Make sure you avoid installing unnecessary plugins, the less the better.</p>
<p>Also install plugins that are well maintained, and has a good community behind it. </p>
<p>Uninstall the plugins as soon as you don’t need them.</p>
<h2>Use Git </h2>
<p>Shared hosting providers allow one click install of WordPress via the cPanel, but it’s aways better to install your copy of WordPress locally and version control it via Git.</p>
<p>And since most shared hosting providers give you a terminal, or SSH ability, you will be able to push the changes to your shared hosting with Git.</p>
<h2>Final <strong>thoughts</strong> </h2>
<p>I guess WordPress ticks all the boxes of a good software.</p>
<ul><li>Maintainability ✅ </li><li>Dependability ✅ – The WordPress team maintain WordPress and it’s very much dependable than before.</li><li>Efficiency ✅ – With the right plugins it can be made efficient to handle a good amount of traffic.</li><li>Acceptability ✅ WordPress is accepted by many developers and the their is a community behind it. </li><li>Security ✅ The core of WordPress is pretty safe, it’s the third party plugins that you need to worry.</li></ul>
<p>At the end of the day, I just need to write my thoughts in my own place, and WordPress is the best solution currently available. Write, publish, repeat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While there may be subtle improvement in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/tesla">Tesla</a>’s Full Self-Driving Beta since its first iteration was launched back in October, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/waymo">Waymo</a> CEO, John Krafcik, seems to have an impression that there is a limit for Tesla’s current autonomous driving efforts. In an interview with the German business publication <a href="https://www.manager-magazin.de/consent-a-?targetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manager-magazin.de%2Funternehmen%2Fautoindustrie%2Fwaymo-john-krafcik-ueber-den-vorsprung-des-google-roboterautos-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174925837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manager magazin</a>, Krafcik had said that the electric car maker is never a competitor to Waymo, seeing Tesla’s tech as just a “really good driver assistance system.”</p>
<p>Waymo’s vehicles, equipped with a different kinds of sensors including LiDAR, are built to be operated to be driverless.</p>
<p>Waymo has even asked its users not to touch its autonomous cars’ steering wheel while the cars are in operation.</p>
<p>In contrast, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta, and also the company’s tech Navigate on Autopilot, still need human touch as drivers still need to keep their hands on the steering wheel in preparation for manual involvement.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1471" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1471"><img loading="lazy" src="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype-300x169.jpg" alt="Tesla FSD’s Vision-based System Criticised" width="485" height="273" srcset="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype-300x169.jpg 300w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype-678x381.jpg 678w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/waymo-s-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-prototype.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1471"><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waymo Self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Prototype</strong></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tesla’s aim, which is to design a full self-driving suite via a vision-based system that depends on incremental improvements, will be rolled out over time.</p>
<p>Through steady updates which are developed on real-world driving data collected and gathered from its fleet, Tesla is hoping to roll out a version of its FSD suite which will totally be a hands-off system.</p>
<p>Once Tesla achieves this, the Electric Vehicle(<a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/ev">EV</a>) maker aims to starts its own ride-hailing service, dubbed by Elon Musk as the Robotaxi Network.</p>

<p>According to the John Krafcik, this is a misconception. He also observed that between Tesla’s camera-based approach and Waymo’s more robust sensor suite, his company’s sensors is of better advantage over Tesla’s electric cars.</p>
<p>“It’s a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system till a day you can miraculously leap to a fully autonomous driving system. In terms of robustness and accuracy, take an example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what is seen on the road from other manufacturers,” said Krafcik.</p>
<p>One of the noted criticism against Waymo’s autonomous vehicles is their high cost, especially when considering their sensor suite which includes expensive components.</p>
<p>However, the CEO, noted that the cost of its cars are really overestimated, most especially as the price of some sensors such as LiDAR has clearly gone down over the years. Today, Krafcik believes that the cost of a Waymo car is actually on the same range as a moderately-equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p>
<p>John Krafcik also noted that he is expecting the cost of hardware per mile of Waymo’s autonomous cars to come in at about $0.30/mile before maintenance and service costs, this includes fleet technicians and customer support <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/01/22/waymo-ceo-says-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-gives-estimated-cost-of-autonomous-vehicles/?sh=2b3325e4541b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">services</a>.</p>
<p>Today, comparing this to ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, who are operating at about $2-$3/mile.</p>
<p>Tesla, however, on the other hand, aims at achieving an $0.18/mile operating cost for its Robotaxi Network.</p>

    <p>Do you want to speed up CSS file loading? Do you also see this waterfall chart in the Network
Tab of your DevTools?
There is a simple measure to help the browser optimize loading assets. Preload them.<br>I think it is <strong>superior to bundling</strong>. It is less complex and has better caching behavior.</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at how we used to do it.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="before">Before</h2>
<p>We normally use </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- blog.html --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="blog.css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="_nav.css"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This loads two CSS files, which might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* blog.css */
@import "../_global.css";
@import "../_nav.css";

/* _global.css */
@import "./_vars.css";
@import "./_reset.css";</code></pre>
<p>They causes the network view to show this graph and clearly shows that loading one file
results in loading more files. Even though we actually know what other files will need to be loaded.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://picostitch.com/tidbits/2021/01/preload-1.png" alt="Preload waterfall, not ideal" width="100%">
    <figcaption>Preload waterfall, not ideal</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let's optimize loading the CSS files.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="after">After</h2>
<p>Preloading the assets is as easy as adding a couple of lines in your site's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.
In the above example we can preload like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_vars.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_reset.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_global.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_nav.css" as="style"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>and it will result in a network graph looking like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://picostitch.com/tidbits/2021/01/preload-2.png" alt="Preloading all CSS files. No waterfall. Ideal." width="100%">
    <figcaption>Preloading all CSS files. No waterfall. Ideal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="superior-to-bundling---why">Superior to Bundling - Why?</h2>
<p>It brings <strong>less complexity</strong>. Bundlers themselves are complex tools. You can drops them
completely for the CSS part of a site by leveraging preloading. You might want to
generate the preload-tags if manual maintanence is a burden. For this site I am sticking to
manually building them. It's not worth the effort (yet).</p>
<p>The browser can <strong>optimize caching</strong> of small files, instead of a big bundled CSS file.
If you deploy multiple times a day you can prevent the customer to have to download a new
bundle every time they visit the site. Using this approach files like <code>_vars.css</code> or <code>_reset.css</code>
may not change as often as others, so the browser won't need to reload them, and even less
a big bundled CSS file.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="details">Details</h2>
<p>On MDN the article 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">Preloading content with rel="preload"</a>
describes how and what can be preloaded in way more detail.</p>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line. Write your metadata atomically with your object. Never separate them.</strong><br></p><p>We welcome your comments.

<a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql">gosql</a> and I wanted to use it to
prototype a SQL interface for data stored in S3. But one missing
critical feature in gosql is <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code> support. This post walks
through the few key changes to gosql to support <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code>.</p>

support <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code> we need to evaluate
both expressions if they exist. Then while we're iterating through
table rows, after testing whether each row passes
the <code>WHERE</code> filter, we'll check if the number of rows

of <code>OFFSET</code> and <code>LIMIT + OFFSET</code> otherwise we'll

<p>
  Just to call explicitly, with <code>LIMIT</code>
  and <code>OFFSET</code> we still have to check every single row in
  the table (at least until we've reached the offset). This should
  clearly illustrate why paginating based on <code>LIMIT</code>
  and <code>OFFSET</code> is not a great idea for big datasets
  <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page">compared
  to index-based pagination</a>.

</header>
<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code. The winner ended being the good old Pandoc 😅</p>— Sébastien Castiel (@scastiel) <a href="https://twitter.com/scastiel/status/1338477555272331265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It takes some time to set it up, especially to get the rendering you have in mind. But once it’s done, the workflow is perfect: write in Markdown, …</p></blockquote></center></article></div>

<p>Sci-Hub is&nbsp;since 2011&nbsp;the world´s most celebrated – and despised – «shadow library», performing&nbsp;«pirate style»&nbsp;copying and republishing&nbsp;for free of subscription based&nbsp;academic articles.&nbsp;The initiator, Alexandra Elbakyan&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;of Kazakhstan,&nbsp;has given&nbsp;a number of interviews but&nbsp;here Finnish library activist and philosopher&nbsp;Mikael Böök&nbsp;in an e-mail interview&nbsp;asks&nbsp;his own&nbsp;specific and&nbsp;very&nbsp;current&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;Just now she´s in the news with a lawsuit against her&nbsp;by&nbsp;Elsevier, Wiley&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;We also get her opinions on Plan S, on joining IFLA and on her alleged&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;communist espionage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://bibliotekettarsaka.com/english-version/">About this blog</a></p>



<p>First Mikael explains his idea and approach for&nbsp;his&nbsp;interview:</p>



<p>It was not possible for me to meet up «physically» with Alexandra Elbakyan for this interview. Nor was it absolutely necessary. Having found her contact details on the Net, I asked her, at the beginning of December 2020, if she was willing to dialog with me about e-books, libraries and so called «shadow libraries». I told her that I had just finished a general essay (here [<a href="http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English"><u>http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English</u></a>]) on e-books in public libraries, and in the Z-Library, which is a so called «shadow library»; now I needed to consult her for another essay on the question of open access to scientific literature and Sci-Hub. Alexandra accepted to start an exchange of views with me, whereupon I formulated a first set of questions for her. She made clear that it would take some time for her to answer them. Waiting for her answers, I spent hours on the web, and reading books, trying to deepen my knowledge about the situation of the open access movement in general, and Sci-Hub in particular. This process led to the questions and answers which are published below.</p>



<p>– <em>Would you like to tell a little about yourself and your background so that people who become interested can then go, for instance, to your blog Engineuring.wordpress.com to find out more?</em></p>



<p>– I’m from Kazakhstan, and I was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineering family. My grandmother was an engineering surveyor and mother a computer&nbsp;programming engineer. So I started creating websites when I was 12 years old and wrote my first computer program in Delphi language when I was 14. Back then a game named Tamagotchi was popular, it is a virtual pet that you can feed, groom and it grows. I was trying to program a Tamagotchi with artificial intelligence inside, so it will also behave as a real animal. I became gradually interested in how cognition works, so I collected a lot of e-books about neuroscience, artificial neural networks and so on. At the university I got interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology of Brain-Machine Interfaces, that can connect your brain to&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;directly. So I started thinking how we can merge our consciousness into&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;using such technologies.</p>

<p>After graduating from Kazakh National Tech University&nbsp;in 2009, I applied to a PhD program in&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States to study bioengineering and such technologies, but was not accepted.&nbsp;So I remained in Kazakhstan and started working as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>I also participated in online forums for scientists. Here I learned that many researchers had a problem with access to academic journals and books, because it was very expensive. So I used my programming skills to create a Sci-Hub web application. Using that application any person can read expensive academic literature absolutely for free! The program immediately became very popular among Russian researchers and then, in the whole world. Today more than 500,000 researchers and students of science use Sci-Hub every day to get access to academic journals.</p>



<p>– <em>In your blog you write that Sci-Hub resembles a so called web scraper. Grateful if you can open the meaning of this technical term a little. And can you then outline the history of Sci-Hub and illustrate how it is being used as a webservice? For instance, it is known that over the years, there has been a certain division of labour between Sci-Hub and Library Genesis (Libgen). What do Sci-Hub and Library Genesis have in common? How do they differ?</em></p>



<p>– Sci-Hub in its essence is a web scraper: A program that downloads web pages from the Internet, processes them, extracts information from these web pages, and saves some information in the database. We have those paid websites with academic journals that many researchers are unable to afford. So what Sci-Hub does in its core, it downloads information from these paid websites, and then provides this information for free to the users.</p>



<p>So how exactly&nbsp;does&nbsp;Sci-Hub download information from paid websites? Some universities are subscribed to these websites. So when you open such&nbsp;a&nbsp;website from the university, it will provide all information for free. Next, all universities provide&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>. Using such&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy server a student or a professor can open these websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>they open&nbsp;it&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;university, while being at home. See? Sci-Hub collects many passwords from students and professors. Then it uses proxy servers to access the websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>&nbsp;they are accessed from universities that have subscriptions.&nbsp;Using a proxy to access the website, Sci-Hub web scraper downloads paid academic journals and provides them to its users for free.</p>

<p>That is the core of Sci-Hub: a&nbsp;web scraper<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>working through&nbsp;password-protected&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>.</p>



<p>There is a widespread&nbsp;<em>lie</em>&nbsp;that Sci-Hub is a search engine while in fact it never had any search function at all.&nbsp;What&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google does,&nbsp;is&nbsp;it gets a bunch of keywords from users, then it surveys web pages on the Internet, looking for such keywords. If some web page contains such keywords, it is displayed to the user. There is no similarities to Sci-Hub.&nbsp;Yes, search engines also&nbsp;contain&nbsp;web scrapers to download web pages from the whole Internet. Then they extract keywords from these web pages and store them in database. When&nbsp;a&nbsp;user is looking for some keyword,&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine checks&nbsp;its database for matching&nbsp;web pages.&nbsp;And sometimes you can look up for free versions of academic journals using&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google.&nbsp;But that is&nbsp;very&nbsp;different from what Sci-Hub does.</p>



<p>Library Genesis is another website that is different from Sci-Hub. Basically it is a huge database that stores millions of academic ebooks. It exists, as far as I know, from 2007 or 2008, and contains also a search engine to look up books in that database.</p>



<p>I created Sci-Hub to access academic journals in 2011 and after that&nbsp;Library Genesis had an idea to store academic journals in their database too, not only books.&nbsp;So they asked me if they&nbsp;could&nbsp;save research articles that Sci-Hub downloads in their database, and we started collaborating. At the beginning Sci-Hub worked without any database at all. Then it started using LibGen database to save the articles, so there will be no need to download them again every time they&nbsp;are&nbsp;requested.</p>



<p>Starting from 2014-2015 Sci-Hub has its own databases and it does not rely on LibGen, but still all new articles downloaded by Sci-Hub are uploaded to LibGen.</p>



<p>So the difference between Sci-Hub and LibGen is that Sci-Hub is primarily an article-download engine, while LibGen is a database without an integrated algorithm to download new articles.</p>



<p>– <em>Sci-Hub and Libgen are often mentioned among the so called ‘shadow libraries’ (in the Wikipedia, for instance, and in the 2018 book «Shadow Libraries» edited by Joe Karaganis.) Then there is yet another ‘shadow library’ which I myself stumbled upon and started to explorate even before I had heard about Libgen. I am surprised that almost nobody talks about the Z-Library. What do you know about that one? (I for one know practically nothing except that it is big, seemingly Moscow-based and maintained on a server in China.) By the way, is the epithet ‘shadow library’ an apt description of a service like Sci-Hub which gives the researchers ‘open access’ to the articles of their colleagues?</em></p>



<p>I remember there&nbsp;were&nbsp;some mistakes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sci-Hub description in that «Shadow Libraries» book by Karaganis, but I do not remember exactly which mistakes. I was very angry when I read the book:&nbsp;They could&nbsp;have&nbsp;asked&nbsp;me to proof-read their chapter about Sci-Hub before publishing, but they didn´t!</p>

<p>As far as Z-Library is concerned, I know that is a website that basically mirrors Library Genesis books database, including the database of Sci-Hub articles.</p>



<p>Why nobody talks about Z-Library and everyone talks about Sci-Hub? Sometimes people even have conspiracy theories why Sci-Hub got such fame and recognition. What can I say? Sci-Hub is actually the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to provide free access to academic journals on a massive scale. Before Sci-Hub there existed websites such as Gigapedia or library.nu, Library Genesis and others that provided academic&nbsp;<em>books</em>&nbsp;for free, but not&nbsp;<em>journal articles</em>. Sci-Hub became the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to target that academic journals problem!</p>



<p>For a long time the existence of Sci-Hub was censored in the media. Sci-Hub started in 2011 and immediately became popular among researchers but… even in 2015 articles discussing the problem of access to academic journals did not mention Sci-Hub!</p>



<p>Then in 2015 the lawsuit from Elsevier came, that included both Sci-Hub, Library Genesis and its mirrors such as Z-Library. A website named TorrentFreak published a short article about the lawsuit, and it listed Sci-Hub… as a mirror of Library Genesis! I read the article and became extremely angry. Then I contacted the journalist to correct the mistake, and they …</p></div></div>

			<p>So Scrum. The most popular agile software development methodology, with <a href="https://www.versionone.com/pdf/2013-state-of-agile-survey.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seemingly</a> around <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/wasitova/codess-prague-agile-vs-traditional-methods-apr-2014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">70%</a> of agile teams using it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6HPTom2AY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">What is it all about? Is it good or is it whack?</a> Has Scrum made our lives better? Let’s dive in.</p>

<p>Scrum has good intentions. Measuring your productivity. Accountability to not do more or less than we agree to do upfront. Increasing visibility for stakeholders. Communication as a team to help each other perform better. The problem is that Scrum’s methods for pursuing these things are not well suited to the act of building software. The first issue I have with Scrum is that the entire system is built around the assumption that you can reasonably estimate how long software development tasks are going to take. Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult, primarily due to 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hidden complexity.</strong> Unless you’re doing something you’ve done before, using the exact same tools and the exact same techniques, it is difficult to know how complicated a given task will be. <i>Today’s tools and techniques change so rapidly that you’re almost never doing things the exact same way.</i> And thus, one problem that looks menacing takes 30 minutes to fix; another problem that seems simple takes 3 days.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent overhead.</strong> Every week, customer crises, bugs that made it past your tests, issues with your libraries that demand you fork and fix, a necessary refactoring uncovered by a feature requirement, and a thousand other “things that come up” occupy our time. These cannot be planned for or anticipated, and they inject a regular but inconsistent amount of overhead that takes us away from executing the plan.</li>
<li><strong>Distractions that affect you differently.</strong> If you’re a developer, you operate in 2 primary modes: Flow and Stuckness. If you’re in a state of Flow (more on this later), you know what you must do and you’re getting it done rapidly. But the smallest of distractions can bring the whole thing to a screeching halt. Distractions are a bad thing when you’re in Flow. But if you’re in a state of Stuckness, you don’t know what’s wrong, and you use the Scientific Method until you solve the problem. John Cowan <a href="http://recycledknowledge.blogspot.com/2005/06/flow-stuckness-and-interruptions.html" target="_blank">says</a>, <i>“Stuckness cannot be overcome by will or planning, only by insight, and the arrival of insight is not predictable. Striving for insight can often be what prevents it from being achieved. The motto ‘Sleep on it’ reflects the perception that blocking the conscious mind can be just the right thing to allow the unconscious mind to operate, often giving the key to the problem as if from nowhere. Distraction is an equally successful approach. During times of stuckness, therefore, interruptions are actually desirable, as they allow this useful distraction.”</i> Since distraction affects developers differently, depending on which mode we are operating in, we cannot know whether the inevitable distractions this week will be a great help, or a great hindrance to us getting work done.</li>
</ol>
<p>These 3 things destroy the elegance of Scrum, by making it very difficult to estimate how long work will take.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg" alt="If you could just tell me how long your work will take, that would be great." title="That Would Be Great" width="526" height="440" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg 526w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px"></a></p>
<p>Not only that, Scrum assumes that you can estimate how long other people’s tasks are going to take! Planning poker assumes that every member of the team can have a reasonable idea of how long everyone else’s tasks on other parts of the system will take. And since Scrum advocates cross-functional teams, this means that a QA person is estimating how long a developer’s job is going to take. This means that a developer is estimating how long a designer’s job is going to take. This is totally unrealistic.</p>

<p>Now, some people will be quick to point out – we don’t measure Scrum tasks by time, we measure them by complexity, or effort, or points, or something else. Unfortunately, this is just a pretty little wrapper that cleverly tries to pacify developers who say that programming estimates are inaccurate, and to satisfy project managers who still want estimates. Because even if you use this wrapper, Scrum still demands that you declare how much work you’re going to do in this sprint – in this fixed time iteration. Scrum wants you to repeatedly answer the question, <i>“Given a certain number of workers and a fixed amount of time, how much work can we do?”</i> By definition, this equation requires you to – implicitly or explicitly – estimate how long each work task is going to take. So, any way you spin it, Scrum assumes you can reliably estimate task duration.</p>
<p>For the reasons listed above, I reject the assumption that you can reliably estimate how long your own tasks are going to take, much less everyone else’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg" alt="One does not simply estimate how long something will take to program." title="One Does Not Simply" width="568" height="335" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg 568w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></a></p>
<p>Some people say that you have to estimate how long things will take for your clients’ sake. Well, I think estimates are wrong more often than they are right, so deadlines and dates tend to be inaccurate in our line of work. Making a habit of estimating things means that you often miss your estimates, and this cultivates a slippery slope that results in either client distrust due to things taking longer than originally expected, or decrease in craftsmanship as you are tempted to “just get it done” because you are trying to meet your estimate even though you know the next guy who touches that code is going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>Scrum fits nicely into the manager’s schedule, but not the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank">maker’s schedule</a>. Paul Graham coined the term in his classic piece about the difference between managers and makers in regards to time management.</p>
<blockquote><p>
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they’re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more. </p>
<p>There are two types of schedule, which I’ll call the manager’s schedule and the maker’s schedule. The manager’s schedule is for bosses. It’s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you’re doing every hour.</p>
<p>When you use time that way, it’s merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you’re done.</p>
<p>Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.</p>
<p>When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in… For someone on the maker’s schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn’t merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work. I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon…</p>
<p>If you’re a maker, don’t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don’t. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think meetings are evil, but they are very costly, particularly to makers. Most businesses and software teams need to have occasional meetings for various things, but Scrum prescribes even more, which exacerbates this issue. Between daily standup’s, sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retro, daily check-in’s, backlog grooming, product demos, company meetings, and technical trainings, its easy to have enough meetings each week to keep your makers in a perpetual state of <a href="http://vooza.com/videos/maker-vs-manager/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">meeting hangover</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="meetings-disrupt-flow" onclick="window.history.pushState('meetings-disrupt-flow', '', '#meetings-disrupt-flow');">Meetings disrupt flow</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so lots of meetings aren’t a good fit for the maker’s schedule, but why is that? Its because meetings disrupt <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow" target="_blank">Flow</a>. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the foremost psychologist on the topic of Flow, asks the question, <i>“What contributes to a life worth living?”</i></p>
<p>He points out that more money doesn’t make us as humans happier. While the average inflation-adjusted income in the U.S. more than doubled over the last half of the twentieth century, self-reported happiness did not increase at all. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg" alt="While the average inflation-adjusted income in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past half century, self-reported happiness has not." title="The relationship between income and happiness" width="720" height="373" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg 720w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><br>
<i>Income data from the U.S. Commerce Department, Bureau of the Census (1975), and Economic Indicators, Happiness data from General Social Surveys, National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago.</i></p>
<p>The concept of Flow is that we feel happier and more fulfilled in life when we can regularly lose ourselves in an activity we have spent years mastering.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg" alt="Flow happens at the intersection of tasks that are highly challenging which occur in areas that we are highly skilled." title="Where Flow Occurs" width="541" height="450" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg 720w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"></a><br>
<i>Flow can only happen when we are doing tasks that are highly challenging, in areas that we are highly skilled.</i></p>
<p>For software developers, this happens when they apply years of experience to a difficult task, and they are so absorbed in creating something that they don’t have enough attention left over to monitor their five senses, or think about the problems in their life, or realize that they’re hungry or tired. It is an ecstatic, literally out-of-body experience. This is where real work gets done and where developers feel most engaged and satisfied in their work.</p>
<p>Getting into Flow is like falling asleep. Its nearly impossible to will it into existence – it takes time, and <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/46283" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the smallest little thing can throw it off and restart the whole process</a>. Meetings and interruptions are the primary enemies of Flow in the workplace, so businesses that employ creative people must make a regular effort to <a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/ways-to-protect-flow/" target="_blank">keep disruptions to Flow at a minimum</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: I spent years mistakenly thinking I understood what Paul Graham meant.
I'm trying something slightly different now.</p>
<p>I prefer a different wording of Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">advice</a> for startups.</p>
<p><strong>Build What They Want</strong> makes the precedence obvious: before you start, you
have to find out <em>who</em> they are, and <em>what</em> they want.</p>
<p>It’s not about building what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<p>Paul Graham starts with “build something”, and that’s what hits your
subconscious first, allowing the “something” to remain ambiguous. I'd prefer to
start with “build what”, so you’re forced to evaluate the “what”. The original
wording lets you think that you can build something and convince people to want
it later (once you show them and tell them how great it is, and all the
important features it has...).</p>
<p>This changes everything.</p>
<p>My problem is that I find it too easy to imagine things that I could build, and
once I’ve imagined something, I struggle to not want to build it exactly that
like. Because I enjoy the process of building.</p>
<p><em>Building</em> is a wonderful thing to enjoy. If you want to start a businesss, just
do it differently.</p>
<p>Instead of applying imagination to products, apply imagination to companies.
What company could exist if someone (you) went and built it? What excites you? A
company is built on something that people want.</p>
<p>How do you know what people want?</p>
<p>Talk to people. Understand them. Ask questions.</p>
<p>Choose who you talk to. Talk to people who you think might want something that
you would be excited to build. Don’t imagine the product though. Imagine the
kind of change you could make in their lives.</p>
<p>They probably won’t be able to describe exactly what they want; the skill you
must develop is in spotting the unexpressed (or inexpressible) want.</p>
<p>But whatever you do, your goal must be to build something they want.</p>
<p>This is strongly related to jobs to be done. The things they want will always be
related to the things they already do. Find that link.</p>
<p>Last year I built something that I wanted to build. I only partly wanted the
final product. Mostly, I wanted the experience of building it. And actually that
turned out to be extremely valuable, though it wasn’t the right way to build a
business.</p>
<p>Then again, it’s important to geek out and build interesting things without
immediate value. Contribute something novel, and maybe one day it will be useful
to someone else (even just as prior art).</p>
<p>And if you’re going to build something for the love of building, you should
definitely do so in public. You’ll make new friends and learn much more. So
publish your code, get a website up, and tell people what you're doing.</p>
<p>You can start by <a href="mailto:ric@rmhsilva.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">telling me</a>.</p>

		<p>We bought a new house last year and as I was moving my old Apple IIe computer from my old attic over to my new attic, I thought it would be fun to hook it up and see if it still worked.&nbsp; To make a long story short … it worked!&nbsp; (Scroll down to see some pictures and even a video clip of my working Apple IIe.)</p>
<p><strong>To make a long story even longer … here are all the gory and geeky details:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1983, when I was only 13 years old and in 8th grade in Central Illinois, my parents bought me an Apple IIe computer for Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I had no computer training but I think there were a couple of APPLE II computers in my school.</p>

<p>Well, now that I look at the photo of my sister and I unwrapping it, I guess it was technically a gift for the both of us.&nbsp; But I think we both knew it was really mine!&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s an old and humorous Apple II commercial:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/05M80HHNB6s?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Purchase Details:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of my Apple IIe computer in November of 1983 was $995 plus $115 for the standard green phosphor monitor for a grand total of $1,165 including 5% sales tax.&nbsp; That translates to nearly $2,700 in 2012 dollars.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of money for a 13 year old kid’s Christmas present.&nbsp; The Apple IIe had only been on the market for less than a year when I got mine so it was not extremely popular yet. To hook it up to your own television, you would pay $70 for a modulator rather than $115 for the green monitor, but the resolution would not be as sharp on a television screen as it was on the computer monitor.&nbsp; We eventually did get the TV modulator, though, so I could use the computer in full color.&nbsp; Full color for an Apple IIe was only 15 colors, by the way.</p>
<p>My parents bought the computer from Wallace Micro-Mart on University Street in Peoria, Illinois.&nbsp; I believe the salesman there, who was listed as “Howell” on the hand written carbon receipt, lived in our same home town.&nbsp; At the bottom of the receipt it says that “Wallace has been serving the Peoria Community for over 10 years”.</p>
<p>I google’d Wallace Micro-Mart and all I found was this old commercial for an Apple Lisa computer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3R8fArhOWso?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Geeky Specs:</strong></p>
<p>The Apple IIe came with 64KB of memory standard, but it was expandable to 1 Megabyte and also had lots of expansion slots for various accessories.&nbsp; It ran at a screaming 1 Megahertz and had an 8 bit data bus.&nbsp; It had 2 text display modes and 4 graphics display modes.&nbsp; The text modes were 40 or 80 columns at 24 lines.&nbsp; The graphics modes were 40×48 or 80×48 block low resolution modes and 280×192 or 560×192 pixel high resolution modes.&nbsp; For comparison, the Apple IIe high res graphics modes were about the same pixel resolution as your most common cell phones used in the year 2005 … and those old cell phones definitely had way more memory than the Apple IIe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apple IIe contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM and booted into it if no floppy disk was found during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxed Nearly 30 Years Later:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the computer in 2011 when I unboxed it during the move.&nbsp; It is basically a big case containing a keyboard, power supply, motherboard and that’s about it.&nbsp; It did not come with a mouse, nor did any of the Apple software support a mouse for the Apple II series of computers.&nbsp; I believe the Apple IIe came with one floppy drive and I think we bought the second one later.</p>
<p>The keys on the keyboard had some serious friction resistance and the keys were not very easy to push down.&nbsp; I think the key wiggle tolerances were pretty tight and the plastic-to-plastic friction caused quite a bit of resistance if you didn’t push the keys in the exact proper direction.&nbsp; Typing on this keyboard was seriously loud.&nbsp; Click, click, click!</p>
<p>There were some unique keys on these old Apple keyboards.&nbsp; Notice the outlined apple key which was called the open-apple and the solid white apple key which was called the closed-apple or solid-apple.&nbsp; The key sequence of simultaneous Control-OpenApple-Reset would reboot the machine immediately.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-Reset would enter BIOS setup before rebooting.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-OpenApple-Reset would perform a self test during reboot.&nbsp; Those are some crazy key sequences.</p>
<p>(Click on any photo to see it in full resolution.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/01.JPG?m=1440971768" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is the green phosphor “Monitor II”, as Apple called it.&nbsp; It had one single RCA style input connector and that’s it.&nbsp; No audio jacks, no output jacks, nothing.&nbsp; This thing was pretty old school and very basic.&nbsp; The serial number on this monitor is actually written by hand.&nbsp; The one cool feature was that the actual glass CRT was mounted on an axis that tilted up and down for a more direct viewing angle.&nbsp; The user just pushed on the darker green plastic frame around the glass CRT to tilt the glass up and down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/02.JPG?m=1440971774" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is what the motherboard looks like inside the case.&nbsp; The lid was basically held down with a couple of hard plastic velcro type devices.&nbsp; There are 8 expansion slots and I was using four of them when I packed mine up for storage back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>The tiny card on the far left is the 80 column card and it is plugged into the auxiliary slot.&nbsp; This card just let the computer display 80 columns rather than the default 40 columns.&nbsp; This card also added more memory to the computer.</p>
<p>The long card on the left in slot 1 is the parallel interface card.&nbsp; It sure took a lot of electronics to interface to a parallel printer back then!</p>
<p>The short card in the middle in slot 4 is a Covox sound card.&nbsp; This card intercepted the sound going from the motherboard (yellow and red wires ) to the built-in speaker (black wires).&nbsp; The built-in speaker is mounted under the keyboard pointing straight down.&nbsp; This Covox sound card also had a headphone jack mounted directly on the card itself.&nbsp; I thought that was terribly inconvenient, so I de-soldered it from the card and mounted it into the plastic hole cover on the back of the computer.&nbsp; The brown wires are connecting the card to the headphone jack.&nbsp; I was pretty handy with a soldering iron, even when I was young.&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>The medium length card on the right in slot 6 is the floppy disk drive controller.&nbsp; Both disk drives are connected to that card using standard flat ribbon cables and nothing else.&nbsp; PC users are used to connecting power cables separately from data cables, but the power and data are both in these ribbon cables.&nbsp; Convenient … and also just a little scary.</p>

<p>This is a 5 and a quarter inch magnetic floppy disk that holds the operating system.&nbsp; Do you remember these floppy disks?&nbsp; Some floppy disks were double sided, so you could flip them over and use the other side and get twice the data onto them.&nbsp; You had to punch out a notch in a specific place on the disk in order to make it read-only.&nbsp; Then you had to put a sticker over that hole in order to write to it again.&nbsp; Computer stores sold special notch cutters, but most of us users just used a standard hole punch numerous times until we got the notch created in the right place in order to open up the microswitch in the disk drive.</p>

<p>30 years ago, I loved that Apple gave stickers away with their hardware and they still do it today and I still love it!&nbsp; This was a folder containing the receipt and some manuals and it also contained some really cool full color apple logo decals.&nbsp; I never used the decals.&nbsp; I just checked EBay and people are selling these vintage rainbow Apple stickers for 20 bucks each!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I guess they are a true collectors item now that they are 30 years old.</p>

<p>The owners manual was spiral bound.&nbsp; It took you though the internals for a computer and then walked you through the DOS command line commands and also introduced you to Applesoft BASIC programming.</p>

<p>Ah, the good old dot matrix printer.&nbsp; Man, these things were loud.&nbsp; And how annoying was it to keep these things feeding the paper properly?&nbsp; These things were part typewriter and part printer.&nbsp; When somebody invented laserjets, we never looked back, did we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/10.JPG?m=1440971781" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>I actually still had an un-opened ribbon for the dot matrix printer.&nbsp; It probably dried out a year after I packed this thing up and went to college, though.&nbsp; I don’t remember how much these ribbons cost, but I do remember trying to squeeze every last drop of ink out of them.&nbsp; We used to reuse them multiple times and some people went as far as trying to re-ink them.&nbsp; I guess we still do the same thing today with our inkjet cartridges and our toner cartridges, though.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/11.JPG?m=1440971788" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the command line after one of my personal boot disks had been booted up.&nbsp; This was just a disk that had some small Applesoft BASIC programs on it.&nbsp; This particular program printed some text to the screen and exited.&nbsp; Very much beginner stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/20.JPG?m=1440971794" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>If you typed CATALOG from the command line, the computer would show you the list of files on the floppy disk.&nbsp; File type (A=Applesoft BASIC, B=Binary, I=Integer Basic, T=Text) and file size (disk sectors) and file name were shown.&nbsp; Notice that file names can have spaces.&nbsp; UNIX did not allow this initially and neither did the early DOS for PCs, but Apple did.&nbsp; Now pretty much every OS does allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/21.JPG?m=1440971803" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>This image shows a listing of a small Applesoft BASIC program.&nbsp; It was written on the command line, line for line, then it was tested and if it worked, it was written to the disk as a file.&nbsp; In Applesoft BASIC you did not start with an empty file on disk and write characters to that file.&nbsp; You created your program directly in the computer’s memory and copied it to disk later.&nbsp; There was no plain text editor app that I’m aware of.&nbsp; No computer manufacturer does that anymore, for good reasons.</p>
<p>In this particular program, it draws some boxes on the screen with the HPLOT commands.&nbsp; Then it creates an artificial delay using the old school empty for/next loop.&nbsp; Then it repeats the box drawing sequence three times with a for/next loop, part of which has scrolled off the screen.&nbsp; After three cycles of the box drawing sequence, it runs a subroutine, which is not necessary in this case since it is only called once.&nbsp; But …</p></div></div>

<p>The credit for the title goes to Jeff Moser and his excellent <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/02/does-your-code-pass-turkey-test.html">post</a> which he authored in 2008. He basically discussed the dangers of improper localization and took a clever approach, stating «“The Turkey Test.” It’s very simple: will your code work properly on a person’s machine in or around the country of Turkey?”». The Turkish alphabet is based on Latin letters but there are few interesting properties of the Turkish alphabet such that
Jeff proposes if your code works fine in Turkish culture, then chances are good it is resilient to possible localization problems in other cultures using the Latin alphabet. Perhaps this is a bit overstatement as there are too many different languages and alphabets. However, unless we have a specific focus in a particular language or have dedicated people working on each language, in practice it’s next to impossible to have bug-free localization in our applications. In that aspect, I believe the Turkey test is a low effort way to do basic
smoke test on localization for your development process.</p>

<p>In his post, Jeff discusses the localization problems mostly from a .NET point of view. In this post, however, I will try to follow Jeff’s footprints but from a JavaScript point of view.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-and-dotless-i">Dotted and dotless I</h2>

<p>Well, the obvious question is why “Turkey”? One of the main reasons to use the Turkish alphabet for testing is that that the Turkish alphabet has two “I” letters. One with a dot and one without.
Namely the upper case  “I” and “İ and lower case “ı” and “i”. And yet there is even a dedicated Wikipedia [article] about it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I).</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/i-i.png" alt="i-i"></p>

<p>The challenge with these “I”s usually occurs when you try to do a case insensitive equality comparison. As a Turkish, I have been burned very badly because of “I” issues.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-oracle-fixed-a-long-time-ago">Problems with Oracle (fixed a long time ago)</h2>

<p>One particular case I remember is I was developing an application for a bank. We had done extensive testing of the application in the local development environment.
But once we deployed the application to the bank’s prod machines, it immediately crashed.</p>

<p>After 13 hours of investigation (at that time my debugging skills wasn’t so sharp so I mostly relied on the logs), I realized my query was in the form of
“select description from …” and Oracle database will always capitalize the column names in its results returning a column with “DESCRIPTION”. 
The developers of ODP.NET were aware of this inconsistency so as a workaround they were calling ToUpper to match the column names from your query. However,
if your code runs within Turkish culture then <strong>ToUpper</strong> call will transform the column name to “DESCRİPTİON” and boom! your code would bail out with a cryptic exception.
Luckily only 3 years later Oracle has fixed the issue by using <strong>ToUpperInvariant</strong> instead of <strong>ToUpper</strong></p>

<h2 id="javascript-world">JavaScript world</h2>

<p>Having reiterated the problem on .NET, let’s explore the situation with the browsers. The browsers take the current culture from the operating system on macOS
and Linux. And on windows depending on the browser they may obey “preferred language” settings.  The following one-liner should help you to get the current culture of the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLanguage</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>userLanguage</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>language</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>browserLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>systemLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to make case-insensitive but 
safe comparisons are to use ToLocalUpperCase and ToLocalLowerCase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>city</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "ISTANBUL"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "İSTANBUL"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>cityU</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "i̇stanbul"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "istanbul"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice the interesting dot on top of the i for lower-case en-us transformation. I have no idea what it is.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-internationalization-objects">JavaScript Internationalization objects</h2>

<p>JavaScript also offers several built-in objects for internationalization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intl</li>
  <li>Intl.Collator</li>
  <li>Intl.DateTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.ListFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.NumberFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.PluralRules</li>
  <li>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.Locale</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl">mdn</a></p>

<p>Although I appreciate the effort, I personally find these APIs relatively limited. The internationalization API extends towards interesting problems like pluralization,
however, if you review the API, it’s mostly geared towards formatting and displaying but relatively weak when it comes to parsing. First, let’s visit our original
problem. Is there another API we could compare “İSTANBUL” with “istanbul” case-insensitively and find them equal?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 1</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems to work expectedly.  What about the dotless I case?
Let’s compare ‘IĞDIR’ and ‘ığdır’ which are considered equal in Turkish case-insensitively.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>IĞDIR</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>ığdır</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: -1</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: -1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice here you must set the culture to ‘tr’ otherwise it won’t work.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h2>
<p>Most languages have different formats for dates so if we have <strong>05/01/2021</strong> does it mean January 5 or May 5?. Some people would argue we should use 
<strong>2021-05-01</strong> but then your users will complain. How about 01 MAY 2021, this is good but then you have to localize MAY. So pick your poison. To make things more complicated, languages like Turkish use “.” instead of “/” as a date separator.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no built-in way to parse such strings to convert JavaScript date objects. You have to rely on external libs like moment.js and
there goes another 75 kb to your bundle.</p>

<p>Finally, I should add that, <strong>1 PM</strong> is shown as <strong>13.00</strong> in Turkish culture. That’s one more thing you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p>Well, it’s a well-known fact that different languages use different symbols for thousands and decimals separators. But being uncareful with number localization has dire consequences. In Turkish thousands is split by dot “.” and for the decimal separator “,” is used. For example
<em>1.234,56</em> is one thousand two hundred thirty-four point fifty-six. In .NET if you try parsing in Turkish culture</p>



<p>What do you think the output will be? Well, it is <strong>1234</strong> as the .NET parser completely ignores the thousands separator even if that wasn’t your intention.
What about the situation in JavaScript? You are completely on your own. parseFloat is just using en-US culture and that’s fixed.</p>

<p>That’s not all. How many digits are there? 10 you say? <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040309-00/?p=40333">Raymond Chen disagrees</a> 
Well at least from a .NET standpoint Arabic digits are also considered as digits. In JavaScript, you are on your own again.</p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>Well, the simple fact is in Turkish and many other languages the currency symbol is written after the numeric value not before as in <strong>100$</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="percentage-symbol">Percentage symbol</h2>

<p>In Turkish, the percentage symbol comes before e.g <strong>%50</strong></p>

<h2 id="other-alphabets">Other alphabets</h2>

<p>Let’s see some peculiarities with other Alphabets. One might think “Z” is probably the last letter in Latin alphabets. Enter the nordic languages</p>

<p>Danish and Norwegian Alphabets:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	Æ	Ø	Å</p>

<p>As you can see there are three letters coming after Z.</p>

<p>In the Icelandic alphabet, Z is obsoleted!!!</p>

<p>Ok, but at least we cans say Z is the last letter if we consider plain English letters. Unfortunately no. Here’s the Estonian alphabet:</p>

<p>A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü.</p>

<p>Some alphabets like Dutch has digraphs like “IJ” which is sometimes considered a single letter. Some fun facts taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(digraph)">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Dutch primary schools, ij used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list ‘ij’ as the 25th letter of the alphabet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a word starting with IJ is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: IJsselmeer, IJmuiden.[5]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces ‘ij’ (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the L). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In word puzzles, ij often fills one square.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s the Nigerian alphabet:</p>

<p>Upper case	A	B	Ɓ	C	D	Ɗ	E	Ǝ	Ẹ	F	G</p>

<p>Lower case	a	b	ɓ	c	d	ɗ	e	ǝ	ẹ	f	g</p>

<p>Upper case	H	I	Ị	J	K	Ƙ	L	M	N	O	Ọ</p>

<p>Lower case	h	i	ị	j	k	ƙ	l	m	n	o	ọ</p>

<p>Upper case	P	R	S	Ṣ	T	U	Ụ	V	W	Y	Z</p>

<p>Lower case	p	r	s	ṣ	t	u	ụ	v	w	y	z</p>

<p>Not only Nigerian alphabet has 3 E letters but they have an I with dot like Turkish but the dot is at the bottom.</p>

<p>If you wonder things can go more interesting than this, ladies and gentleman, I present you Hungarian keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/hungary.png" alt="hungarian-keyboard"></p>

<p>My non-elven eyes see there are 4 U’s and 4 O’s with different accents in the Hungarian keyboard most of them being at right hand side :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite its widespread use, I have a feeling that JavaScript is not on par with backend languages like .NET when it comes to localization capabilities. 
What is the solution? You probably have to rely on third-party libraries. An alternative route might be to use Blazor which brings .NET Runtime into the browser.
That way you can get the benefit of all the Globalization goodies of .NET but your app can still reside in the browser. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.</p>

themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                    Preface to the Wolfpack Edition

This is Geoff Cashman's venerable User's Guide to Empire.  It was written
in 1991, and Empire has evolved quite a bit since then.  Nevertheless, many
players have found it useful through the years, so here it is.  We
reproduce it verbatim except for this preface and corrections of a few
editing mistakes.

				Preface

This guide's intended audience is the beginning player and those players
who have played a game or three and would like to have some insight on some
more subtle aspects of the game.  Some experienced players may find some 
benefit from reading this guide as well.  While you may feel you are an
expert, it is always possible to learn.  Nothing in this guide is intended 
to be difficult to understand, and every effort has been made to make this
guide an easy learning tool.

				Foreword

It has been over a year now since I first sat down and thought in a serious
way about writing this guide.  It has been a long trip with many interesting
turns and developments.  When I first started, the version of Empire that
this guide has ultimately been written for had not yet been released.  Now,
with this project nearing release I find that yet another new version of
Empire is coming out.  I look on in near despair as I realize that this guide
may very well soon be outdated.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to release
this information in what might be considered a final form.  

However, I hope that this is not the final form.  With new versions of
Empire coming out in the very near future I hope that some other potential
author steps forward and takes up the banner of educating the new player. 
I caution you though that such a work as this takes quite an effort. 

To the reader and any critics or even cynics that might be reading, I say
that I am not writer.  I never was, and I never intend to be.  There are
certainly enough writers in the world to write almost everything the world
could want to know about in print.  I was never skilled in the art of proper
style for any sort of writing.  Please, be kind and keep this in mind.

I wrote this guide because I felt there was a great need for something of
this nature.  I have watched so many players come to the network looking
for information on Empire, such as the rules, or information on how to play.
One can get information about the various commands available to oneself
within the game, but to understand how to use those commands effectively
and get skilled at running a country is a far greater task.  Many new
players have despaired after playing their first game for lack of the
requisite knowledge to play effectively.  Some come back fighting hard
in the next game, but many just disappear never to be heard from again.
This guide was written with the hope that if the new player is supplied
with the basics, they can advance in skill more quickly than previously
possible and not despair at their first defeat. 

I am hoping that within the near future two other companion guides to 
this one will be written and released to the net.  These two guides will
be intended to make the average player a better player or even expert,
and to teach fledgling deities how to compile and establish a, solicit 
entries for , and effectively run, a game.  Some people have commented
to me that the time spent on these guides would be better spent if I 
were to spend time programming for Empire instead.  It is my belief that
in teaching players to be better players, and teaching deities how to be 
a deity should that guide be released, the potential pool for
programmers of Empire will increase.  

I can not take credit for the idea of this guide.  The need for such
a guide I think was painfully obvious to a great many players.  Some in
fact did engage in projects to fill that need.  Every such attempt has
fallen short, in my humble opinion.  Witness the large number of people


User's Guide to Empire							 4

who still ask the network, "How do I play?" and even more importantly
the lack of sufficient answer to such people's questions.  In my highest
hopes, I dream that someday soon that answer will be "Get a copy of the
User's Guide to Empire, which is available via FTP from xx.xx.xx".

This work was made possible by the contributions of several Empire players.
This work would not have been completed without the insights and assistance 
of many Empire players and deities.  To the Empire community as a whole,
I say thank you for your priceless contributions.

Chapter 1 :-: What is Empire?

	Empire is a game in which you are pitted against several other
	players in a country vs. country format.  There are economies to
	run, armies to support, policies to generate, and allies and
	enemies to make.  The game supports various features that make
	certain aspects of the game seem to parallel the "realistic"
	world.  These include satellites, planes, banks, parks, etc.
	
	Empire, in the version herein described, is a very complex 
	game.  The closest game that most people will know that is 
	analogous to it is the game known as Risk.  However, Empire is 
	more complex by a factor of at least one hundred.  Nevertheless, 
	as a result of the computer aiding you every step of the way, the 
	game is not difficult to play, though it can be difficult to 
	learn.  If you read this guide thoroughly, and use it as a 
	continuing resource, you can help make learning this game a lot 
	easier. 

	It should be noted that in learning to play this game, you
	may become frustrated or feel daunted by its complexity. 
	Several players have noted that they almost gave up on Empire,
	until one day when everything seemed to start to make sense.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>This is a guest post authored by <a href="https://jacobian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, co-creator of Django.</em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a good deal of my career with my feet in two different worlds. I came up as a web developer and helped create a popular web framework (Django). And I’ve spent a sizable chunk of my career working in information security.
Unfortunately, I’ve seen these two roles clash far too often. Engineering often sees Security as standing in the way of delivery, or as creating meaningless busywork. Security thinks Engineering is irresponsible, willing to ship broken or vulnerable code.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than a decade trying to bridge this gap. There’s no silver bullet. But, over and over, I’ve seen one practice be quite effective: automated security tests — and particularly integrating security checks and tests into an existing CI pipeline.</p>
<h3>Bringing Security along on the CI/CD journey</h3>
<p>Engineers have largely embraced CI as a critical part of quality assurance, and that a robust test suite that runs on every commit is a huge enabler of velocity. We can be bold about making changes, knowing that the test suite will catch us if we’ve messed up. A mature CI/CD pipeline is a reliable litmus test for good software.</p>
<p>Historically, though, Security has been left out of this CI/CD journey. We’ve relied on manual security assessments; hands-on exercises like threat modelling and threat hunting; and bespoke penetration tests. These are important activities that will always have a place in a mature product security lifecycle, but they increasingly are difficult to integrate into an agile delivery model that relies on incremental changes and automated tests. Much of the friction between modern engineering and security teams can come down to this impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>So, to get Security and Engineering playing well together, one massively useful tool is getting security work integrated into continuous delivery. When done right, Security and Engineering work together to produce automated checks that cover security issues in the same test suite that’s already in CI. This maintains delivery cadence, gives confidence about the security of the product, and — most importantly — gives a place where Security and Engineering collaborate, rather than conflict, to produce secure code.</p>
<p>How does this look in practice? Each organization is different, but there’s a typical progression of maturity that Security and Engineering orgs go through as they build a continuous integration and automation pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</li>
<li>Level 2: Security and Engineering collaborate to produce test cases and remediations</li>
<li>Level 3: After the issue is fixed, Security and Engineering collaborate to find systemic fixes and develop checks</li>
<li>Level 4: Security and Engineering now also proactively look for new classes of issues and create systemic checks before an actual problem occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll walk through each of these phases with a specific example about a team that systemically fixed an issue with logging sensitive tokens.</p>
<h3>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</h3>
<p>This is (unfortunately) how many organizations operate. Nobody really works together: Security is off in one corner looking for vulnerabilities (or, worse, waiting for a breach and then responding!). When they find one, they tell Engineering, who (hopefully) fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s begin the example and see how this could shake out in practice. A few months ago, Nathan Brahams <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about systemically fixing an issue around accidentally logging sensitive tokens</a>. His article illustrates the steps a quite mature security/engineering organization would take, but I’ll use this issue as a jumping-off-point to imagine how teams earlier in their journey might approach discovering a similar issue.</p>
<p>So, imagine a budding team has found this security issue: SQLAlchemy debug logging is turned on and sensitive tokens are being logged. The issue is fixed with a clever technique that uses a custom <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column that prevents SQLAlchemy from logging the token's value. So, we just swap in <code>ObfuscatedString</code> for the token column. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, while this does fix the issue, it has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If Engineering just rolls out this fix, how do we verify that the issue is actually fixed? Usually at this level of maturity, the Security team will manually verify the fix, but that’s error-prone. It’s also slow; if the fix didn’t work or is incomplete, the cycle has to repeat itself.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: If another engineer, some time later, doesn’t understand this <code>ObfuscatedString</code>, it could get reverted or modified in a way that re-introduces the issue. How would we know if this happens? (Spoiler alert: with an automated test, which we’ll discuss in the next section.)</li>
<li>Is this a one-off issue, or <strong>is it a systemic issue</strong>? Are there other sensitive values elsewhere that might be logged?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Most importantly, this workflow sets up conditions ripe for conflict between Security and Engineering. It creates a dynamic where it’s easy for Engineering to feel like Security’s just creating work for them, and where Security can feel ignored or powerless to fix problems. I’ve never seen this model produce a really healthy relationship; just ones with varying levels of dysfunction. Even when Security helps write the fix, the lack of any sort of robust verification or systemic analysis means it’s very likely they’ll need to come back later with this issue or a similar one again, which both parties will resent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: automated tests</h3>
<p>The next rung on the maturity ladder is one that’s becoming increasingly common: instead of just fixing a security issue, Security and Engineering will collaborate on producing a test case (and often the fix). Following along with the example above, we might write a test case that sets up a test model with an <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column, captures some logs, and verifies that the value is correctly obfuscated.</p>
<p>This relatively simple addition fixes a bunch of problems we had before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If the test case passes, we can be confident the security issue is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Because this test case is part of our test suite, if it ever regresses the test case will fail, and we won’t risk re-introducing it to production.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Security and Engineering are now working more closely together, increasing the chances both teams will see this as “our issue” and “our fix”, not “their problem”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: we still lack any sort of understanding of whether this issue occurs elsewhere, or any sort of holistic fix for the entire class of issues. In the case of logging sensitive tokens, it’s easy to imagine this issue occurring elsewhere. So when — inevitably — a similar issue occurs elsewhere, we’re likely to be bitten again. And this, in turn, will continue to produce the kind of resentment that can be so damaging to Security/Engineering working well together.</p>
<h3>Level 3: systemic fixes and checks</h3>
<p>The next step, then, is for Security and Engineering to work together to find systemic problems and fixes. Things start out as above — it’s important to fix the specific vulnerability first, before getting fancy! But after the specific fix is in, Security and Engineering come together to figure out if this is a systemic problem. If so, they work to develop a check or a fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a fairly simple holistic fix. For example, <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/understanding-and-preventing-dos-in-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about ReDoS last time</a>. Discovery of a ReDoS vulnerability might lead to discovering other similar potential problems. That in turn could lead to the decision to switch to <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, which isn’t vulnerable to ReDoS.</p>
<p>But much of the time, the systemic fix is more complex — there isn’t a simple drop-in replacement that eliminates a class of vulnerabilities. That’s true of this sensitive-logging issue: we don’t have any sort of logging module that can magically know when variables are sensitive, and obfuscate them.</p>
<p>This is where code scanning tools like Semgrep come in. They are a terrifically important part of a mature product security workflow. Traditional testing practices — unit tests, integration tests, etc — are great for reproducing specific security issues, and ensuring that they’re fixed and won’t regress. But they struggle to discover whole classes of security issues, and this is what code scanners enable. Traditional code linters (e.g., Flake8, RuboCop) help to ensure code consistency and find some common issues, but since they have to apply generally to all kinds of projects, they tend to only provide a one-size-fits-all best-practices check. Tools that understand code semantically, like Semgrep, can be used to write tests for <em>your unique codebase</em> and find whole classes of security issues — including, most importantly, new instances of a problem that might be added after the check has been written.</p>
<p>And indeed, that’s what Nathan and his team did: they wrote a Semgrep rule that finds columns with names suggesting they’re sensitive (e.g., containing “token”, “secret”, “key”, etc), and issues a warning.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re in a pretty good spot. New code is continually scanned for this issue, and when found, they are fixed robustly. We have a workflow and tooling that ensures that the original, specific issue is fixed and that it stays fixed, and we ensure that similar issues — present and future — are discovered and fixed. Security and Engineering collaborate on this work, which is now well-automated. There’s still (of course) room for teams to not get along, but we’ve removed some of the most common pain points (verification, regression, conflict between teams).</p>
<p>If suddenly blocking builds with new checks will only increase conflict in your organization, you could softly roll out checks that do not block Engineering and only notify Security. For issues that arise, Security can begin conversations with Engineering to collaborate on both specific and systemic fixes. Once the check is satisfactory to both …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

				<p>The new RP2040 chip by RaspberryPi is amazing. When we got our hands on this beautiful little thing, we did what we always do with new chips and slapped on a Goldfish; our favourite acid bassline synthesizer (we make fish and chips hahahaha).</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-200x125.png 200w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png 300w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-320x202.png 320w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-400x251.png 400w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-600x376.png 600w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-700x441.png 700w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-768x482.png 768w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-800x502.png 800w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">While benchmarking the performance by copy/pasting instances of our entire Goldfish in search of the chips limits, we suddenly found ourselves with a polyphonic synth. We have since rewritten these multiple instances into a 16 voice Poly-Goldfish with 4 oscillators per voice. To celebrate we designed a PCB and brightly coloured frontpanel to give this new Goldfish some dedicated controls.</p>
<p>Bring-up was trivial due to the amazing documentation and the extremely flexible PIO-blocks. The RP2040 is a dream to work with. Childlike giddiness ensued while lying on the carpet and programming in VSCode on an RPi400 talking directly to the RP2040. This is the way to release a chip onto the world: with fantastic documentation, an open toolchain and plenty of examples of how to use everything. There is a tantalizing hint at the start of the data sheet that this is the lowest grade chip of the family they plan to release… we cannot wait to play with the RP4755.</p>

<p>Once these chips hit general availability we will probably share some designs on our <a href="https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience">Github</a>. This chip is now part of our go-to set of tools to make the cool stuff and will very bloody likely be inside our next three modules.</p>

Because of the easy, &nbsp;high quality, multi-platform, FREE and even beginner-friendly toolchain they have built around this chip we can expand the accessibility to the insides of our designs. With these chips it is way easier for us to have you do things like adding your own algorithms, building extra modes or creating personal effects. We can lean on the quality of RaspberryPi platform and this amazing chip.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>While I was developing a rust crate (<a href="https://github.com/edg-l/paypal-rs">paypal-rs</a>) I noticed my error handling was pretty bad.</p>
<p>In that crate I had to handle 2 different types of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP related errors, in this case <code>reqwest::Error</code></li>
<li>Paypal API errors, which I represent with my own struct <code>PaypalError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially I used <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow">anyhow</a> but then I found out this is pretty much only good to be used on binary applications, not in libraries.</p>
<p>The way to make this nice and clean for the library consumers is to wrap the errors.</p>
<h2>Wrapping the errors</h2>
<p>First we need to know which errors need to be wrapped, in my case I have <code>PaypalError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/// A paypal api response error.
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PaypalError {
    // ...
}

// implement Error and Display for PaypalError...
</code></pre>
<p>And then an error from the reqwest library: <code>reqwest::Error</code>.</p>
<p>First we create an enum to represent all possible errors in our library:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ResponseError {
    /// paypal api error.
    ApiError(PaypalError),
    /// http error.
    HttpError(reqwest::Error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>And as with any error, we have to implement <code>Error</code> and <code>fmt::Display</code>:</p>
<pre><code>impl fmt::Display for ResponseError {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        match self {
            ResponseError::ApiError(e) =&gt; write!(f, "{}", e),
            ResponseError::HttpError(e) =&gt; write!(f, "{}", e),
        }
    }
}

impl Error for ResponseError {
    // Implement this to return the lower level source of this Error.
    fn source(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;(dyn Error + 'static)&gt; {
        match self {
            ResponseError::ApiError(e) =&gt; Some(e),
            ResponseError::HttpError(e) =&gt; Some(e),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we should make all the functions that return a Result use the new Error type, this will also give consistency to all our functions.</p>
<p>However, right now we can’t use <code>?</code> directly on our wrapped Errors:</p>
<pre><code>/// func_call_returns_error() returns a Result&lt;(), reqwest::Error&gt;

pub fn some_func() -&gt; Result&lt;(), ResponseError&gt; {
    // Won't work, because the error returned is not ResponseError and has no From implementation!
    // func_call_returns_error()?
    // However we can map it.
    func_call_returns_error().map_err(ResponseError::HttpError)?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementing From on the wrapped errors</h2>
<p>To solve this, we have to implement <code>From&lt;PaypalError&gt;</code> and <code>From&lt;reqwest::Error&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>impl From&lt;PaypalError&gt; for ResponseError {
    fn from(e: PaypalError) -&gt; Self {
        ResponseError::ApiError(e)
    }
}

impl From&lt;reqwest::Error&gt; for ResponseError {
    fn from(e: reqwest::Error) -&gt; Self {
        ResponseError::HttpError(e)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And now our code becomes like this:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn some_func() -&gt; Result&lt;(), ResponseError&gt; {
    func_call_returns_error()?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<h2>The library to skip all this process</h2>
<p>There is a library called <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror">thiserror</a>, which implements macros to make this process a breeze, here is how our code ends up if we use this library:</p>
<pre><code>use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum ResponseError {
    /// A paypal api error.
    #[error("api error {0}")]
    ApiError(#[from] PaypalError),
    /// A http error.
    #[error("http error {0}")]
    HttpError(#[from] reqwest::Error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s all the code we need!</p>
<p>This is equal (or maybe even better) than our previous code, the best is that it is entirely transparent, the library consumers won’t even know <code>thiserror</code> was used, quoting their github:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thiserror deliberately does not appear in your public API. You get the same thing as if you had written an implementation of std::error::Error by hand, and switching from handwritten impls to thiserror or vice versa is not a breaking change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For candidates, a full day of interviews is grueling, but in the context of demonstrating your technical skills and how well you’ll perform on the job, it’s a short amount of time. There’s not enough time to invent completely novel solutions, or to prototype multiple different approaches. Instead, you’ll have to rely on previous experience.</p>

<p>Given this time constraint, the single most effective trick for an effective interview is <strong>pattern matching on a toolbox of common techniques</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="rapid-pattern-matching">Rapid pattern matching</h2>

<p>Interviews become easier when you can look at a problem and quickly assess, at a high-level, what approach to take. Every problem is unique, but most are variations of the same common principles. It’s even okay to be wrong at first. When you go down one route and encounter some difficulties, just pattern match on the next technique based on those difficulties.</p>

<p>Let’s see how pattern matching plays out in a few scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/01/28/the-balanced-parentheses-problem.html">The balanced parentheses problem</a></strong>, specifically the third follow-up with arbitrary delimiters. Until that follow-up, you can go through the input string once in a for loop. But if you try that with arbitrary delimiters, you find you may not have enough information to tell if a particular character is an opening or closing delimiter. There’s ambiguity. At this point, you reach into your toolbox to find which technique deals with ambiguity: backtracking!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A system design problem like <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/05/11/system-design-practice-designing-a-payment-system.html">designing a payment processor</a>.</strong> Talking through the problem with the interviewer, it turns out the key requirements are reliability (ensuring every promise made to the user is fulfilled) and idempotency (the effect of each action happens only once). If you have a comprehensive toolbox, you know a queue-based architecture is appropriate and you can design the system around that queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design and implementing a lightweight chat application.</strong> Some of the tools in your toolbox to draw from include a client-server architecture, database modeling of domain objects like users and messages, and REST APIs. To support instantaneous delivery of messages, the tools you have include server-sent events, polling or even bi-directional channels like WebSockets. Even the composite architecture composed out of these tools is itself a common architecture, and therefore a pattern in your toolbox.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all these cases, you <em>can</em> build up the right techniques from scratch, often through trial and error. But if you can immediately pattern match to find the appropriate techniques, and <em>you can name those techniques</em> (“I’m going to use backtracking because we’re dealing with ambiguity”), then the interviewer quickly knows you’re on the right track.</p>



<p>An effective toolbox of techniques consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common algorithmic techniques.</strong> <a href="https://avikdas.com/2019/04/15/a-graphical-introduction-to-dynamic-programming.html">Dynamic programming</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/02/25/a-tree-based-introduction-to-backtracking.html">backtracking</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2019/08/13/practical-computer-science-connected-components-in-a-graph.html">graph algorithms</a>, to name a few. Having a formal computer science education helps, but practicing problems and reading up on the theory can make up the gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common types of large-scale systems.</strong> <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/03/23/scalability-concepts-distributed-id-generation.html">Horizontal scaling</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/04/13/scalability-concepts-read-after-write-consistency.html">consistency in distributed systems</a> and <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/05/11/scalability-concepts-the-reliability-queue.html">queue-based architectures</a> are good examples. Unfortunately, experience working at scale really puts you ahead of the pack, but I’ve tried to write articles about these concepts to help those without the relevant experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common building blocks of practical applications.</strong> These are the tools you’ll use to implement a project, like web frameworks used to build REST APIs, common databases and interfaces to those databases, and UI libraries for the client portion of these projects. You don’t have to know every possible API or framework, but you should be able to build a full application in your area of expertise (client, server, full-stack, etc.).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two categories of tools become increasingly more important the more senior you are. Meanwhile, algorithmic techniques are more important for junior engineers with less industry experience.</p>

<p>The best way to build up this type of toolbox is to observe real-life applications, recognize the technologies and techniques used in those applications, and most importantly, <strong>understand why those technologies and techniques were used</strong>. Whether the application uses Kafka or RabbitMQ doesn’t matter, but the fact that a queue is used for reliability is key.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-the-right-approach">Is this the right approach?</h2>

<p>I don’t think an interview that relies only on pattern matching is ideal, though it’s not completely unfounded either.</p>

<p>Interviewers often talk about assessing a candidate’s problem solving skills. There’s the type of interview where you’re expected to not come up with a perfect solution, but to think through a hard problem from the ground up. To some extent, that type of interview is more reflective of a software developer’s day to day work. But some amount of pattern matching is important for any senior engineer, whose past experience plays a large part in making solid technical decisions.</p>

<p>Still, regardless of what interview style is ideal, pattern matching will still help you succeed in the types of interviews you’ll encounter <em>in practice</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Real-world development is done collaboratively over the course of weeks, months and years. Interviews need to evaluate candidates in a matter of hours. For that reason, candidates benefit from pattern matching problems to common techniques. By quickly recognizing the type of problem and what techniques are applicable, you can demonstrate to the interviewer you’re going in the right direction early on. Then, you can spend the rest of your time focusing on the particulars of the given problem.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://verietyinfo.com/taiwaneng/after-disabling-adobe-flash-trains-in-dalian-china-could-hardly-open-technews-科技-新-报/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://verietyinfo.com/taiwaneng/after-disabling-adobe-flash-trains-in-dalian-china-could-hardly-open-technews-科技-新-报/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Adobe Flash was completely disabled in 2021. Although many media outlets report that Chinese flash agent Chong Orange Network claims to continue to run upgrade services, but this seems useless. Due to the recent suspension of the Flash train in Dalian, China, the entire line of trains in Dalian could hardly work. To solve the problem it was necessary to create a special “technical group” for more than 20 hours.<span id="more-695158"></span></p>

<p>80 years ago, Dalian Railway Station was the largest and most modern railway station in Asia. However, Dalian Railway Station reportedly seems to have frozen in a certain era, and many technologies sound rather “retro”.</p>
<h3>The train dispatch system is actually designed with Flash</h3>
<p>According to the content of the public account WeChat “Warehouse depot of Dalian Railways”</p><p>; Dalian Railway was stated that at 20.00 on January 12, the mayor responsible for dispatching stations, for the first time said that the system page of dispatching machines can not be displayed normally, which did impossible to control the state of operation of trains. The marshal group cannot be displayed, and a maneuvering plan cannot be organized.</p>
<p>In the next half hour almost the same problem arose in the transportation and production of computers across the line. After the technicians “searched the Internet”, it was confirmed that the source of the fault was due to the complete suspension of Flash in Adobe in the US.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174827/flashtran01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Many network users should be surprised to see this. First of all, is the railway system in the region and the train control system throughout the region written with the most uncertain and resource-intensive Flash?</p>
<p>Second, the cessation of Flash is not a sudden cessation, it has been announced for at least 3 years. As a result, the railway company had to wait until support was officially stopped, and then a problem arose, and a search on the Internet suddenly revealed that “the United States has completely stopped Flash content.” Do the IT staff of this company have obvious problems?</p>
<p>However, this is not the only problem, this is just the beginning!</p>
<h3>Install the backup computer in person and go to the station on site to install and check?</h3>
<p>The article “Delyan Dalian” takes time as a whole, deliberately creating an exciting solution to “deactivate the flash” of the “technical team”. First, the headquarters installs a backup computer, devises a solution, and then personally takes the installed computer to the station for on-site inspection.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174918/flashtran02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and more!</p>
<p>Isn’t it 2021? Isn’t there something called the Internet? To solve the problem of disabling Flash, why should I install another computer and then transport it to the station for testing? Isn’t this a solution that IT staff used only 10 years ago?</p>
<p>In addition, network users also found out from the article that the railway company has computers divided into computers “original Microsoft system” and “Ghost version system”. The article explains that the original Microsoft system computer is resolved, and the computer “version of Ghost” must be removed.</p>
<p>Honestly, I haven’t heard of “Ghost Edition Computers” in 10 years, but in reality it mostly applies to pirated systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174919/flashtran03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3>So how do they solve the problem of disabling Flash?</h3>
<p>After spending so much effort and running around different stations with your computer, how did you finally solve the problem of disabling Flash?</p>
<p>Answer: “install the old version of Flash Player”.</p>
<p>Wait, is everything that simple?</p>
<p>It’s that simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174921/flashtran04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Just install the old version of the executable file of the Flash player on the pirated system, why spend the whole night sleepless and do it like Keanu Levy from “Defense Forces”, who runs between different stations, desperately holding a computer, because what?</p>
<p>I don’t know, maybe … it looks really hot, right?</p>
<p>Chinese network users called the incident “the happiest technology news in early 2021.” The article in the official WeChat account of the “Dalian Train Department” may have something wrong in the message and the article has been deleted.</p>
<p>But Flash was eliminated, and it, by the way, almost eliminated the railroad in the big city, which is really amazing. Perhaps even more interesting is that local electricity and transportation systems are also designed with Flash, right?</p>

<![CDATA[Create Azure AD apps with one line of code]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Need to automate creating Azure AD applications? Look no further. It just got easier with CLI for Microsoft 365.</p> <h2>Before you begin: Azure AD</h2> <p>When you build apps on Microsoft 365, one of the very first things that you need is an Azure AD app. Azure AD app represents your app on the Microsoft cloud. In your Azure AD app you configure what kind of app it is (desktop or web app), how users can authenticate (or if your app is an automated process and doesn't require user context at all) and which permissions your app requires in Microsoft 365 to work.</p> <p>Azure AD offers many settings to support the different scenarios and you can configure them through the Azure Portal. But what if you want to standardize your configuration and share it with your dev team, put it in your CI/CD pipe or give it to your customers?</p> <h2>Automating creating apps with Azure CLI</h2> <p>To automate creating resources on Azure, you can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview?WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure ARM templates</a>. ARM templates support many types of resources on Azure, <em>except Azure AD apps</em>. To create Azure AD apps, you would need to write a script using Azure CLI.</p> <p>Azure CLI has the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_create" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>az ad app create</code></a> command that allows you to create Azure AD apps. Using this command you can configure some basic settings of the app such as if it's multi-tenant, what reply URLs and which API permissions it has. If you want to configure additional capabilities, such as expose APIs, you need to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update the existing Azure AD app</a>. To add a secret or a certificate, you would call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app/credential?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_credential_reset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another command</a>. For some things, there are no commands available in Azure CLI and you would need to call the Microsoft Graph using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>az rest</code></a> command yourself.</p> <p>Using Azure CLI you can create and configure Azure AD apps exactly to your needs. If you have a solid understanding of Azure AD and the different settings, you will appreciate the verbosity and flexibility of Azure CLI. But what if you're looking for an easier way of creating Azure AD apps?</p> <h2>Easily create Azure AD apps with CLI for Microsoft 365</h2> <p>Many developers have a basic understanding of Azure AD. Yet, everyone needs to create Azure AD apps in one shape or another. Especially if you build apps on Microsoft 365, there is no way around it. So to help you get started, in the preview version 3.5 of <a href="https://aka.ms/cli-m365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLI for Microsoft 365</a>, we introduced a new command that allows you to easily create Azure AD apps with just one line of code.</p> <p>To create an Azure AD app for a deamon app with specified Microsoft Graph permissions, you'd execute:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">m365 aad app add <span>--name</span> <span>'My AAD app'</span> <span>--withSecret</span> <span>--apisApplication</span> <span>'https://graph.microsoft.com/Group.ReadWrite.All,https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In comparison, with Azure CLI, you write a script similar to:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>$appName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"My AAD app"</span><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When installing software with Nix, if the target isn’t available in a binary cache somewhere, the software will be built on your machine from source.
This is fine for a development machine, but when deploying software on a remote server this can be tricky depending on the resources available. Building Haskell programs is a long, resource intensive process,
so on a <code>t2.micro</code> EC2 instance it’s pretty much a lost cause.</p><p>Luckily, with GitHub Actions we can use Docker and Nix to build our IHP app and ship a small image containing only what is necessary to run the app.
This took a lot of trial and error to get working, so hopefully this can help you save time and get your application up and running!</p><h2 id="building-a-nix-derivation">Building a Nix derivation</h2><p>I wasn’t able to use <code>nix-build</code> to build a derivation of my project with the Nix files included with IHP, so to get this working I copied the structure of the Nix files included in the project
and changed what was needed to get a build to work. I split up the code into two files, <code>default.nix</code> which is used as the entry point for <code>nix-build</code>, and
<code>build.nix</code> which actually creates the derivation for the project.</p><p>These files assume your IHP project lives in a folder named <code>./web</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span># default.nix</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>So far, this Dockerfile will build our project and create a symlink pointing to its place in the Nix store in the <code>./result</code> directory. At this point, the image is pretty huge: about 10GB! This is mainly build dependencies like GHC. When shipping to production, we don’t want to keep these around. This is where the beauty of Nix comes in: we can use the <code>nix-store</code> command to get only the runtime dependencies for our derivation, and copy them over to a fresh image using Docker multi-stage builds.</p><p>Continuting on in the same Dockerfile…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span># Store all runtime dependencies in a folder</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>After building this Dockerfile, the result will be an image containing a <code>bin</code> folder, <code>Config</code> folder, <code>static</code> folder, and <code>IHP</code> folder, which is is all that is needed to run an IHP app. Use the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> environment variable to point to your PostgreSQL database, start the image, and your IHP app will be up and running.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">docker run -p <span>"8000:8000"</span> -e <span>"DATABASE_URL=..."</span> &lt;your image name&gt;

Super easy, and best of all free!</p><h2 id="thats-it">That’s it!</h2><p>Now you have a Docker image which contains a built IHP application. This can be deployed in any way you deploy Docker images. To keep costs low, I deployed my project on an AWS EC2 instance running NixOS along with a PostgreSQL database. Come back next Wednesday for a guide on getting that working, and as always please leave a comment with any questions or suggestions.</p><p>I’d also like to give huge thanks to Marco for his excellent post about using multi-stage builds and Nix over at <a href="https://marcopolo.io/code/nix-and-small-containers/">his blog</a>.

<p>Without leaving the letter <em>M</em>: <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#metcalfe-s-law"><strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#mooers-law"><strong>Mooers’s Law</strong></a>. I’m not saying an adage should never, ever be named after a person. I’ll admit, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a> have a certain catchiness to them. But the trend of taking a maxim and calling it Person’s Law has resulted in dozens and dozens of these things being produced, and it makes my head spin. Soon every fact or aphorism will be Somebody’s Law. Not only have such adage laws become a cliché, but, as I have found when researching this article, many of the laws are either not named after the person who came up with the idea (ignorance), or are named by the author after themselves (egotism). They are also called “laws” when they aren’t really laws to lend the ideas more credence than they deserve, or at least more memetic value. It’s hard for me not to take on a negative tone in this article after being exposed to such egotism and ignorance. Apologies in advance.</p>
<p>Newton earned his laws. So did Asimov. But now any lazy aphorism can lend your name immortality if you push for it hard enough. Let me give it a go:</p>
<h3 id="taylor-s-law"><a href="#taylor-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: taylor-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Taylor’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If an adage is named after a person and called a law, there is a 50% chance the law is named after the wrong person, and if not, there is a 50% chance it was named by the author after themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your friends. Ironically, I have basically stolen <strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> here (see <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#stigler-s-law">below</a>). Oh well, nothing is new under the sun.</p>
<p>Here are some popular adage laws. There are so many of them, but I bet you’ve heard of at least half. Special thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws">Wikipedia’s list of eponymous laws</a>.:</p>
<h3 id="amara-s-law"><a href="#amara-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: amara-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Amara’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People overestimate the impact of a given technology initially, then underestimate it. Basically, when the hype bubble bursts, people are disappointed. After that, things return to a reasonable baseline. <em>Named after Roy Amara, the futurist who created the idea.</em></p>

Andy and Bill’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An increase in hardware computing power will be met with an increase in software demand. Very similar to <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#wirth-s-law">Wirth’s law</a>. <em>Named after Andy Grove, Intel’s former CEO, and Bill Gates, Microsoft’s former CEO. Based on an old joke that, “what Andy gives, Bill takes away.”</em></p>

Atwood’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All software that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript. <em>Created by Jeff Atwood, of the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> blog. Named by himself after himself.</em></p>

Benford’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In real-world data sets, the leading digit is much more likely to be a ’1’ than any other digit: the chance is about 30% <em>Named after Frank Benford, who originally called it the Law of Anomalous Numbers, though it was mentioned first by Simon Newcomb decades prior.</em>. </p>

Benford’s Law of Controversy:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.” <em>Stated by Gregory Benford the sci-fi author, not to be confused with Frank Benford, the physicist and engineer who lends their name to the first Benford’s Law.</em> Because we have two “Benford’s laws”, maybe we should stick to Frank Benford’s original name for his law: the Law of Anomalous Numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="betteridge-s-law"><a href="#betteridge-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: betteridge-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Betteridge’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Headlines which end in a question mark can be answered by the word “no”. (This really only makes sense for yes-or-no question headlines.) Studies have tried to disprove this law by showing that articles which have yes-or-no headlines are more likely to be answered in the body of the article “yes” than “no”, but these studies are clearly missing the point of the law. <em>Named after the tech journalist Ian Betteridge, who did not create the principle, though he claimed he did. Also referred to earlier as “Davis’ law”, with no reference to who Davis is.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="brandolini-s-law"><a href="#brandolini-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: brandolini-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Brandolini’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than the energy needed to produce it. <em>Originally called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle by Alberto Brandolini on Twitter, though the idea has been around since before Twitter was even a thing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="brooks-law"><a href="#brooks-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: brooks-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Brooks’ Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” because it takes time for new members of a team to become productive, and because tasks are not infinitely divisible and adding people creates communication and collaboration overhead. <em>Created by Fred Brooks, author of the Mythical Man-Month, and named after himself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="campbell-s-law"><a href="#campbell-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: campbell-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Campbell’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative social metrics often corrupt the process they are intended to measure because people will try to game the metric. <em>Created by the social scientist Donald T. Campbell. Although this law is often worded differently than <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#goodhart-s-law">Goodhart’s law</a>, as described by Campbell it is basically indistinguishable from Goodhart’s law, which was stated before Campbell’s law.</em></p>

Cheop’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is ever built on schedule or within budget. A patently false child of <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#hofstadter-s-law">Hofstadter’s law</a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law">Murphy’s law</a>. <em>This one is named after an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, but was created by Robert A.

<h3 id="chesterton-s-fence"><a href="#chesterton-s-fence" aria-label="Anchor link for: chesterton-s-fence"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Chesterton’s Fence:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know why something is a certain way, leave it alone until you do. If you see a fence or other barrier across a road, some people will immediately try to remove it, but they may be ignorant of the reason for the fence and so could be making a mistake. <em>Named after Gilbert Keith Chesterton who stated it in one of his books. The allegory is clever and original, but the underlying idea is not and is essentially a restating of, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” or of the Precautionary principle, etc. It’s not technically an adage law, but I included it because I like it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="claasen-s-law"><a href="#claasen-s-law" aria-label="Anchor link for: claasen-s-law"><img src="https://taylor.gl/link.svg" alt="chain link icon"></a>
Claasen’s Law:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Usefulness increases with the logarithm of technology. Combined with <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law">Moore’s law</a>, this gives technology a linear rate of improvement in terms of usefulness. <em>Named after the originator of the idea, Theo A.

    <section>
            <div>
        
<p>In early April, <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I wrote a long post covering all the science I could find about aerosols and droplets</a>. The basic summary was that this is an area of medicine with lots of misconceptions, poor assumptions, and incomplete science. There was good evidence that previous coronaviruses were spread by aerosols. There was good evidence that influenza is spread by aerosols. Overall, it seemed very likely that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was being spread by aerosols, but the science was pretty weak. There is still a lot we don’t know, but as I update the evidence 6 months later, it is pretty clear that aerosols play an important, and unfortunately still widely ignored, role in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dispelling some misconceptions</strong></h2>



<p>There are still many who argue strongly against the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID-19. In general, I think these arguments clash with science and have significant logical inconsistencies. Before getting to the evidence that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, let’s dispel a few widely held misconceptions.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 has a low Ro</h3>



<p>One main argument against aerosol spread points to the Ro, with the assumption that airborne diseases will always spread easily, and therefore have a high Ro. The argument is often framed as, “this disease doesn’t look like measles, and therefore cannot possibly be airborne.” This is bad logic, as infectivity and mechanism of transmission are separate concepts. Some pathogens require higher numbers to reliably cause infections, which will result in a lower Ro no matter how the infection is transmitted. “While many airborne infections are highly contagious, this is not, strictly speaking, part of the definition.” (Tellier 2019)</p>



<p>The logic here is clearly faulty. The argument being used has the basic format: “X is a Y. Z is not like X. Therefore Z cannot be a Y.” This is somewhat like saying “a horse is a mammal, therefore that dog cannot be a mammal because they don’t look the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This logic is especially problematic in the context of aerosol spread because there are other diseases with good evidence of aerosol spread, such as influenza, that look nothing like measles, but a lot like COVID-19. In fact, the prototypical airborne pathogen is tuberculosis, and tuberculosis has an Ro between 1-3 (exactly like COVID-19). (Ma 2018)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the statement that ‘COVID looks nothing like measles’ is probably untrue. On average, disease transmission is low, but if you look at <a href="#superspreaders">super-spreaders</a>, COVID-19 starts to look a lot like measles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the arguments based on Ro are both illogical and inconsistent with science. If anything, the Ro of COVID-19 looks exactly like other known airborne diseases (such as tuberculosis), and so this would be an argument in favour of airborne spread.</p>



<h3>Most transmission is short distance</h3>



<p>The equally fallacious corollary to the Ro argument is that “if COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols, we should see a lot of infections occurring over long distances”. Although it is true that aerosols will disperse much further than droplets, it is faulty logic to define the <em>mode</em> of transmission by the <em>distance</em> of transmission. The concentration of infectious particles falls dramatically with distance, even when those infectious particles are carried by aerosols. They are spread out through 3 dimensional space, and therefore decrease exponentially with distance. Although aerosols <em>can </em>transmit disease over long distances, they are much more likely to transmit disease over a short distance. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>This illogical step is so ingrained in the infectious diseases literature that most studies just assume droplet spread if there was close contact. This illogical assumption undermines a great deal of the existing infectious disease literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an interesting historical analogy, for decades it was thought that tuberculosis was transmitted through droplets and fomites, because it occurred most often after close contact. We now know that tuberculosis <em>can only be transmitted through aerosols. </em>(Jimenez 2020)</p>



<p>The existing science refutes the assumption that close contact suggests droplet spread. At the typical conversational distance of about 1 meter, exposure to aerosols is about 2000 times greater than exposure to droplets. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>The bottom line is that short range disease transmission is definitely consistent with aerosol transmission, and distance cannot be used to define mode of transmission. </p>

Transmission by both aerosols and droplets is highest when close to the patient. Although aerosol transmission can occur at a distance, the vast majority will occur at close range.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So why don’t we see a lot of long range transmission of COVID-19? The primary explanation is simple dilution. The further you are from a patient, the more dilute aerosols become. Risk of aerosol transmission drops off dramatically with increasing distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of dilution of aerosols is evident in everyday life. You can smell cigarette smoke when you are standing 8 meters away from a smoker, but it is nothing like the obnoxious fumes present if you were standing right next to them. Similarly, cigarette smoke is much worse indoors than out. Imagine each smoke molecule as a virus. You are obviously at much higher risk 1 meter away than you are at 8 meters. (But that doesn’t make smoke a droplet.)</p>



<p>Dilution doesn’t prevent exposure to the virus, but it makes it less probable. With dilution of aerosols, the primary driver of infection is the intrinsic infectivity of the pathogen. If infection occurs after exposure to only a few viral particles, we should expect to see more long range transmission despite the dilution. If larger exposures are required, we will see fewer infections. This is the primary difference between measles and COVID-19.</p>



<p>One final note about long range transmission: we really don’t know how common it is in COVID-19. Identification of long range transmission is incredibly difficult unless there are a very small number of cases. With a small outbreak of measles cases, it is easier to determine exactly where individuals were, and identify airborne transmission. For the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, we do not know how the individual became ill, and so could easily be overlooking long range transmission (especially when the possibility of aerosol transmission is dismissed out of hand in some circles). In fact, there seems to be pretty good evidence of long range transmission in many of the <a href="#superspreader">super-spreader events discussed below</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Our current approach is working</h3>



<p>Another argument occasionally used to dismiss aerosols as a mode of transmission is that our current PPE approach seems to be working in hospitals. First, <a href="https://first10em.com/we-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-healthcare-workers-from-covid-19/">I would point out that healthcare workers are contracting COVID-19 at a rate that is far higher than the general population</a>, so this argument is pretty weak. Furthermore, as will be explored further below, there are many other factors that significantly dilute aerosols in most hospitals, like excellent ventilation, good distancing, and masking of both patients and providers. Although not quite as good as N95s, well fitting surgical masks will still filter out as much as 80% of infectious aerosols. (Makison Booth 2013) Combined with the low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, these factors keep us relatively safe even when we stubbornly ignore the science that suggests aerosols are very important in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Particle size</h3>



<p>Many of the arguments against the aerosol spread of COVID-19 rely on incorrect assumptions about particle size. <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I went into this at length in the first post</a>, so won’t repeat myself here. The basic summary is that particles of sizes that many articles refer to as droplets actually remain airborne for prolonged periods, and are therefore better classified as aerosols for the purposes of transmission. Just be careful when reading articles, because many don’t define these terms. When I use the term aerosol here, I am referring to any droplet that remains suspended in the air for longer that a few seconds, whatever the size, because that is the feature that matters for infection control. </p>



<h3>The lack of definitive proof</h3>



<p>Some of the arguments against aerosol transmission simply assume droplet transmission and demand “definitive proof” for aerosol transmission. I won’t attempt a treatise on the philosophy of science here, but that is an unreasonable bar.</p>



<p>One version of this argument states that viable SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated from the air, and therefore we cannot definitively prove airborne transmission. This demand is unreasonable. Measles and tuberculosis are both known to be airborne, and no one has been able to isolate viable pathogens for either from the air. (Jimenez 2020) Furthermore, this is probably an outdated argument, as multiple studies actually have identified viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air. (Lednicky 2020; Santarpia 2020a)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of whether or not viable virus has been cultured from air samples is irrelevant. The point is that unfair standards are being used when comparing aerosols and droplets. There is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through large droplets. (Jimenez 2020) It is crazy to require such stringent proof of aerosol transmission, while simultaneously just assuming droplet transmission is occurring. The same standards must be required for both claims. We are unlikely to have ‘definitive proof’ of either claim. Our decisions must be made based on the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There is good evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols</strong></h2>



<p>Although there is no “smoking gun”, the evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols is relatively strong. Below I outline the …</p></div></section></div></article></div>

<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

        <p>Data visualization is an important tool, and there’s been many cases where I’ve found myself wanting to visualize data from a CSV file. As I’ve <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">been learning F#</a> in the New Year, I thought that plotting a chart would be a great exercise to help sharpen my F# skills.

According to the Kaggle definition, danceability is “The relative measurement of the track being danceable (ranging from 0 to 1)”, but I’m unsure what the exact criteria for danceability is (maybe tempo and loudness combined with some other variable?). The end result should produce an HTML file which you can then embed on a website:</p>


    
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        
    
    
        
        
    




<p>After creating a new F# console project in Visual Studio, the first step was to load the CSV file so that we can feed the data to XPlot. This can be done using the CSV type provider in the <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/">F# Data library</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I created a new module called CSVRead inside a new file called CSVRead.fs. Inside the module, I place the first few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>filePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>Path</span><span>\</span><span>To</span><span>\</span><span>data_by_year.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span>  <span>rawCSV</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>filePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we bind our filepath to an identifier and then create a new type which contains the CSVProvider plus our filepath. We also include HasHeaders = true as our CSV file contains column headers.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that in F# we use [&lt;Literal&gt;] the same way we would const in C# or other languages. I’m using a literal here due to a blessing and curse of type providers in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have our type provider setup, the next step is to create a function which loads our CSV file by using the GetSample() function from our type provider:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>loadCSVFile</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>try</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>cSVFile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>cSVFile</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function’s signature is unit -&gt; Some cSVFile. Note that we’re using an option here since the CSV file may not load (for more information on using options for error handling, see <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-14-handling-errors-fsharp-with-option-types/">this post</a>).</p>



<p>Now that we have a way to load our CSV file in place, the next step is to use XPlot to chart our data with Plotly, a handy charting library with an HTML frontend. To do so, I created a new file called Graphing.fs which would contain our graphing module and associated functions.</p>

<p>With our Graphing module created, the first step was to create a graphData function which would map our chosen rows to a scatter plot. My solution ended up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>graphData</span> <span>(</span><span>rawCSV</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Scatter</span><span>(</span>
       <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Year</span><span>],</span>
       <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Danceability</span><span>],</span>
        <span>mode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lines+markers"</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function takes in our rawCSV type and returns a Scatter object, which is produced by iterating over the Year and Danceability rows of the CSV file.</p>

<p>One important thing to remember, is that in F#, the order of your files matter. In my Graphing module, I had been getting the error: <em>FS0039: The namespace or module ‘CSVRead’ is not defined</em> which confused me as I was referencing was my own module inside Graphing.fs. It turns out however, that I had forgotten to put CSVRead.fs above Graphing.fs inside Visual Studio, but once I did the error cleared up right away.</p>

<p>Although I’m not used to having the order of source files matter, it makes quite a lot of sense in terms of readability as the same principles apply to functions within the files. My experience with this style so far has made it easier to understand programs as I’m not constantly jumping from file to file and looking in different areas while trying to mentally keep track of function side effects.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a function which takes our scatter plot as input and then sets up the actual plot in Plotly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createPlot</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>Scatter</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>data</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Plot</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithOptions</span>
        <span>(</span><span>Options</span><span>(</span><span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Music Danceability Over the Ages"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithXTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Year"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithYTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Danceability"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithWidth</span> <span>700</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithHeight</span> <span>500</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above code is fairy straightforward, setting up a pipeline which creates a chart to plot and then fills it with the relevant information. I must say that I’m becoming a big fan of F# pipe-forward operator as I find this style of coding to look clean and elegant while being easy to reason about.</p>



<p>With our CSV and graphing modules now in place, the final step was to chain our functions together in our Program.fs EntryPoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>CSVRead</span>
<span>open</span> <span>Graphing</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>loadCSVFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>graphData</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>createPlot</span> 
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re loading our CSV file and then chaining functions together to graph the data and create the plot. Note the use of Option.map here as loadCSVFile() is returning an option. In addition, we’re ignoring the return value since Plotly is being loaded and displayed in the browser and we don’t need any return value.</p>



<p>As you can see, plotting a chart from a CSV file is fairly straightforward in F#. I find F#’s pipe operator and lack of visual clutter makes it very succinct and easy to understand. Although this example creates a connect scatterplot, Plotly has a wide variety of chart types that you can create, and I highly recommend taking a look and playing around to see what you can do!</p>

1.4. (#1806)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> File lists generated by <cite>pip show -f</cite> are now
rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
directory lower. (#1933)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
was accidentally lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
that ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
similarly to before.</p></li>

the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
it’s internal HTTP cache which supplants the <code><span>--download-cache</span></code> the
existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>DRM is the bridge between the Linux kernel and actual software running atop
Linux, for most operations which involve a graphics card. For example, X11 and
Wayland actually send drawing commands to the graphics card using DRM.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll be talking about how to write software which communicates with
the graphics card directly, completely bypassing X. Do mind that I am also
learning while I write, so some information might be inaccurate and also I’m
jumping through unnecessary hoops, from the perspective of just getting things
done.</p>
<p>I’ll be using C++.</p>

<p>The kernel DRM API is file based, which means you can open a file representing
the graphics card (usually <code>/dev/dri/card0</code>) and use that file to send actual
commands to the card, using the <code>ioctl()</code> syscall with the opened file
representing the card.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also a library conveniently named <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm/">libdrm</a> that
simplifies all that. Keep in mind that all that it does is what we mentioned
above: opening a file and sending commands through <code>ioctl()</code> syscalls.</p>
<p>In C++ a simple program that interacts with the video card through DRM might
look like this at the top level:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cassert&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</span><span>

}
</code></pre></div><p>And as a sanity check we can try to run it in a Linux machine:</p>
<pre><code>❯ clang++ drm-part-1.cpp -o drm-part-1
❯ ./drm-part-1
❯
</code></pre>
<p>Surely enough, it runs! But it doesn’t do anything yet. It needs that <code>ioctl()</code>
magic, but at least no assertions failed and we know we can open the video card
file now!</p>
<p>Lets include another library which has some very handy <em>structs</em> and also
definitions of parameters for <code>ioctl()</code>: <code>libdrm/drm.h</code>. While we are at it,
lets also include <code>sys/ioctl.h</code> and <code>iostream</code> for syscalls and printing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;libdrm/drm.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first interaction that we are going to have with the card is not going to be
with the card itself but just with the driver (bummer, I know). Lets try to
retrieve the driver version using a <code>ioctl()</code> call.</p>
<p>There is a definition for a <em>struct</em> which holds exactly this data in
<code>libdrm/drm.h</code>, <code>drm_version_t</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>drm_version</span> {
	<span>int</span> version_major;	  <span>/**&lt; Major version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_minor;	  <span>/**&lt; Minor version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_patchlevel;	  <span>/**&lt; Patch level */</span>
	__kernel_size_t name_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of name buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>name;	  <span>/**&lt; Name of driver */</span>
	__kernel_size_t date_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of date buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>date;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold date */</span>
	__kernel_size_t desc_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of desc buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>desc;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold desc */</span>
};
</code></pre></div><p>To get the version from the driver we need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a <code>drm_version_t</code>, notice there are some <em>char *</em> fields for which
we need to allocate memory.</li>
<li>Call <code>ioctl()</code> with the appropriate parameters and a pointer to our
<code>drm_version_t</code>.</li>
<li>Print out the information we get and free everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems easy enough right? Lets do it!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">drm_version_t <span>create_version</span>() {
  drm_version_t version;

  version.name <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.desc <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];

  <span>return</span> version;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>delete_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  <span>delete</span> version.name;
  <span>delete</span> version.date;
  <span>delete</span> version.desc;
}
</code></pre></div><p>To print it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>print_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.name, version.name_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.desc, version.desc_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_major <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_minor <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_patchlevel <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And finally, we can call all that in our <code>main()</code>, notice the <code>ioctl()</code> call
using the <code>DRM_IOCTL_VERSION</code> value, which is defined in <code>libdrm</code> so we don’t
have to worry about the specific values passed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>(<span>int</span> arg_count, <span>char</span><span>**</span> arg_vector) {
  <span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> open_gpu();
  assert(gpu <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  drm_version_t version <span>=</span> create_version();
  assert(ioctl(gpu, DRM_IOCTL_VERSION, <span>&amp;</span>version) <span>==</span> <span>0</span>);
  print_version(version);
  delete_version(version);

  assert(close_gpu(gpu) <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>After a little compiling, behold the power!</p>
<pre><code>❯ ./drm-part-1
i915
Intel Graphics
1.6.0
</code></pre>
<p>We are <em>talking</em> to the DRM driver of my Intel graphics card! No X11 involved,
this runs even directly in the <em>tty</em>!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <em>libdrm</em> does a lot more than just provide the definitions and
we do not need to be calling <code>ioctl()</code> directly, but for the purposes of
learning I found important know exactly how the syscalls are made to the
graphics driver.</p>
