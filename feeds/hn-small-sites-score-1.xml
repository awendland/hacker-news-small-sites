    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>numbers<span>:</span> Array<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>:</span> number <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    numbers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> total<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

Writing programs in Python takes less time than other languages. It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time. It also supports large set of libraries and built-in modules.</p><p>

Django is a free and open-source Web Framework in Python,that encourages rapid development and clean, programatic design. It follows MVT Architecture. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes re-usability and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p><p>

This Course is designed for the beginners, and no prerequisites have been defined.</p><p>

This Python training course begins with the basic concepts of python programming and works upward to full-fledged web application development using Django.</p></div>

          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.

            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

Without setting any servers, we can do a lot of things like <a href="https://www.ravsam.in/blog/collect-form-responses-using-google-apps-script/">collecting form responses</a>, email marketing campaigns, etc. But as a developer, we like our code to be on Version Control System like Github. In this blog, we will discuss how can you setup Github Actions to automatically backup your Google Apps Scripts to Github.</p><h3 id="contents">Contents</h3><ol><li><a href="#1-installing-clasp">Installing Clasp</a></li><li><a href="#2-creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new Repository</a></li><li><a href="#3-adding-important-files">Adding Important Files</a></li><li><a href="#4-setting-up-github-actions">Setting up Github Actions</a></li><li><a href="#5-adding-github-actions-secrets">Adding Github Actions Secrets</a></li><li><a href="#results">Results</a></li></ol><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>Before getting started, we assume that you have set up the following:</p><ul><li>A Google Apps Script Project</li><li>A Github Account</li></ul><h2 id="1-installing-clasp">1. Installing Clasp</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/google/clasp">Clasp</a> is a Google tool to develop Apps Script projects locally. It is short for <strong>Command-Line Apps Script Projects</strong>. Setting up Clasp is simple. Follow this <a href="https://github.com/google/clasp#readme">amazing guide</a> by Google to get your login credentials, which we will be using later while setting up Github Actions.</p><p>Once you have successfully logged in, use the following command to get the content of the credentials file.</p><h2 id="2-creating-a-new-repository">2. Creating a new Repository</h2><p>Depending upon your requirement, create a new public/private repository at <a href="https://repo.new/">Github</a>. Once you have created a new repository, add a .gitignore file with the following content:</p><p>This prevents our credential file to be committed back to the repository.</p><h2 id="3-adding-important-files">3. Adding important files</h2><p>Now it’s time to add some new files to the repository.</p><p>a.) <strong>setup.sh</strong></p><p>This script will prevent us from logging in again by using our already logged in credentials from Github Actions secrets, which we will be setting up later.

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

            <h2>Mastodon bad. Pleroma good.</h2>
            <p>If you’ve been following me on the fediverse, you would’ve witnessed my
numerous (failed) attempts at migrating from Mastodon to Pleroma,
running on my Raspberry Pi. I finally got it working, and these are the
steps I took. It’s sort of a loose guide you could follow, but I can’t
promise it’ll work for you.</p>

<p>The Erlang and Elixir packages are pretty broken and outdated on
Raspbian. So this time, I built them from source.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> I also assume
you have Mastodon and Pleroma (source, not OTP) installed—probably at
<code>/home/mastodon/live</code> and <code>/opt/pleroma</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>Once you have Erlang and Elixir compiled and sitting in your <code>PATH</code>,
pull <a href="https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/migrator">soapbox-pub/migrator</a>.
Now read the readme and the <code>do_migration.sh</code> script to get an idea of
what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>Move into the cloned directory and create a <code>.env</code>:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>MASTODON_PATH</span><span>=</span>/home/mastodon/live
<span>PLEROMA_PATH</span><span>=</span>/opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, run:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> yarn   <span># install deps</span>
<span>$</span> cp -r mastodon/* /home/mastodon/live
<span>$</span> cp -r pleroma/* /opt/pleroma
<span>$</span> <span>RAILS_ENV</span><span>=</span>production yarn masto <span>export</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you run into any permissions issues, <code>chown</code> and proceed. This should
export all your Mastodon activity into <code>/home/mastodon/live/migrator</code>.
Now, copy the <code>migrator</code> directory into your Pleroma installation path.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> cp -r migrator /opt/pleroma
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then import all of it into Pleroma (possibly prefixed with <code>sudo
-Hu pleroma</code>):</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> <span>MIX_ENV</span><span>=</span>prod mix migrator.import
</code></pre></div>

<p>If all went well, you would’ve successfully migrated from Mastodon to
Pleroma. If not, well feel free to send me an email (or @ me on the fedi).
I suppose you could also reach <a href="https://alexgleason.me/">Alex</a>—he’s
the incredibly based guy who wrote the migrator,
<a href="https://soapbox.pub/">soapbox-fe</a> and does some Elixir magic he keeps
<a href="https://gleasonator.com/@alex">posting about</a>.</p>

<p>Rest assured, the migrator has a 100% success rate—Alex and I are
apparently the only two who have it working. 2/2.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-migrate">why should you migrate?</h2>

<p>Because Pleroma is cleaner, leaner<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and prettier looking<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Oh, and we
have chats.

It was disclosed in August that the national AI strategy presented by the authority had been <span><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/2020/08/12/saudi-national-ai-strategy-approved/">approved by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud</a></span>. PWC has forecast that AI could contribute $135 billion (or 12.4%) to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by the year 2030.</p>
<p>Established by royal decree in August 2019, the SDAIA was given the mandate to drive the national data and AI agenda for transforming the country into a leading data-driven economy, and has developed Saudi Arabia’s national AI strategy over the past year. Although the details of the plan have been kept under wraps, the new strategy is expected to contribute to 66 of the country’s strategic goals, which are directly or indirectly related to data and AI.</p>
<p>The SDAIA has already reached a number of milestones since its inception, establishing three specialised centres of expertise: the National Information Center, the National Data Management Office and the National Center for AI. It has also begun building one of the largest data clouds in the region by merging 83 data centres owned by over 40 Saudi government bodies. More than 80 percent of government datasets have so far been consolidated under a national data bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the authority has been using AI to identify opportunities for improving the Kingdom’s government processes, which may result in some $10 billion in government savings and additional revenues.</p>
<p>Originally slated for March 2020, the Global AI Summit will discuss AI, its applications, impact on social and economic development, plus global challenges and opportunities. The event aims to connect key decision makers from government and public sector, academia, industry and enterprise, tech firms, investors, entrepreneurs and startups.</p>
<p>October’s virtual summit will be organised into four tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Shaping the new normal;</li>
<li>AI and governments;</li>
<li>Governing AI; and</li>
<li>The future of AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Global AI Summit aims to tackle the challenges faced by countries around the world, from technical to ethical. Details of the agenda and speaker platform for the Global AI Summit have yet to be announced, although the presentation of the Saudi national artificial intelligence strategy is bound to be a highlight.</p>

Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

<div>
<div>
 <div>
<p>The PixLab development team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the <strong><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">PixLab API 1.9.72</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pixlab.io/images/pix.png" alt="PixLab Logo"></p>
<p>Since its launch on 2017, PixLab have already processed over 450 Millions of users contents whether static images, GIF or Videos Frames.
<strong>This milestone release introduces new <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">API endpoints</a>, various minor bug fixes, processing speed improvements by up to 5% and many innovative features</strong>.
Let's start with the one we are existed about in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">Passports &amp; ID Cards Scan</a>: While documents scanning were introduced in earlier version of the PixLab API via the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> endpoint. This release pushes further the accuracy of the OCR engine. <strong>A 5MB raw Passport sample now takes less than 3 seconds to execute</strong> including face detection &amp; extraction, MRZ (<em>Machine Readable Zone</em>) extraction and finally transformation of the Raw MRZ data into textual content. You can try out the accuracy of the <strong>Passport scanning engine</strong> using these <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/3a8df5c54e427ec1781515ceb27965e4">Python</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/symisc/ca211ac7ff38ddcaab102e98fe5a7fa9">PHP</a></strong> scripts to see it in action.</li>
<li>DNS infrastructure moved to <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> for faster than ever response times.</li>
<li>Full support for <strong>HTTP/2</strong> and <strong>HTTP/3 (QUIC)</strong>.</li>
<li>Up to <strong>three layers of redundancy</strong> for the standard <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=ocr">PixLab OCR engine</a> for faster, accurate &amp; guaranteed scan results.</li>
<li>A fresh update of the <strong>adult &amp; gore content detection ML model</strong> which is used to power the famous PixLab /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=nsfw">NSFW</a> API endpoint that have already analyzed over 100 millions of user contents with high accuracy.</li>
<li><a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facedetect">Face Detection</a> (including <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facelandmarks">facial landmarks</a> extraction) &amp; <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facemotion">Emotion Pattern</a> (including gender &amp; age) extraction are now using the RetinaFace Model which scores the highest on the LFW dataset.</li>
<li>The /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint now fully support scanning ID cards from <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2019/11/docscan-api-endpoint-support-id-cards-passports">Malaysia &amp; Singapore</a> and many other countries (at users request) as well the brand new <strong>India Aadhar ID card</strong>. Find out more information about <strong>Aadhard fully support</strong> via our blog announcement <a href="https://blog.pixlab.io/2020/03/full-scan-support-for-india-aadhar-id-card">here</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, a brand new, high performance custom image processing layer written in C/C++ and powered by <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> and our <a href="https://sod.pixlab.io/">Embedded computer Vision Library SOD</a> is integrated directly into our cloud API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pixlab customers are more than advised to take a look at <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmdls">The official API endpoints documentation</a>, <a href="https://pixlab.io/examples">The Samples Page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab">The Github repository</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>Finally, for potentially interested users, you are more than welcome to <strong>start a 7 days free trial</strong> to see the API in action. Simply head to the <a href="https://pixlab.io/dashboard">PixLab Dashboard</a> and activate your free trial from there.</p>

September 4, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-hetzner-hcloud/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-hetzner-hcloud/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In a number of posts on this site I have covered Prometheus and some of the service discovery methods, including: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-consul-node_exporter/">Consul</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-srv-discovery/">DNS SRV Records</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">OpenStack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next release of Prometheus (v2.21 at the time of writing) Prometheus will also be able to discover services for <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka">Eureka</a> and <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the v2.21 release of Prometheus is available as a Release Candidate (available <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.21.0-rc.0">here</a>), meaning we do not need to compile Prometheus from source to make use of it. However if you intend to run this in production, it is advisable to wait for final release.</p>
<h2 id="hetzner">Hetzner</h2>
<h3 id="who-are-hetzner">Who are Hetzner?</h3>
<p>Hetzner are a German hosting company and data centre operator. They run data centres in three locations (Nuremberg, Falkenstein and Helsinki in Finland), and can provide everything from webmail to dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Hetzner’s <a href="https://robot.your-server.de/">Robot</a> is the name they give to their dedicated server offering. The Hetner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">Cloud</a> provides virtual servers, load balancers, private networking and more.</p>
<p>The Prometheus Service Discovery isable discover servers from both Robot and Cloud.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-account">Creating an account</h3>
<p>To sign up with Hetzner’s Cloud, go to the Hetzner <a href="https://accounts.hetzner.com/signUp">Account Sign-Up</a> page. This will create an account which is usable across all of Hetzner’s products.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account, you will be asked to create a project like so: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-addnewproject.png" alt="Add new project"></p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-addnewproject-name.png" alt="Add new project - name"></p>
<p>Currently you cannot create resources in a specific project using Terraform, nor can you limit targets by project in Prometheus, so what name you choose is arbitrary.</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>There is an official <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hetznercloud/hcloud/latest">Terraform Provider</a> for Hetzner’s Cloud offering which will allow us to create virtual servers ready to be discovered by Prometheus.</p>
<p>For information on how to install Terraform and an examaple project structure, see <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/#configure-terraform">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="create-an-api-token">Create an API Token</h3>
<p>Terraform uses Hetzner Cloud API keys to authenticate and provision resources. You can generate a key in the <strong>Security</strong> section of the <a href="https://console.hetzner.cloud/">Hetzner Cloud Console</a>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-security.png" alt="Hetzner Cloud Security"></p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/hcloud-generateapitoken.png" alt="Hetzner Cloud - Generate API Key"></p>
<p>You can configure the API Token directly in the Terraform provider configuration: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>provider</span> <span>"hcloud"</span> {
  token <span>=</span> <span>"$API_TOKEN"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, you can set an environment variable of <code>HCLOUD_TOKEN="$API_TOKEN"</code> (eg <code>export HCLOUD_TOKEN="$API_TOKEN"</code>) that the Terraform provider will use instead.</p>
<p>If you are using Terraform version 0.13, you can also add the <code>hcloud</code> provider to your list of required providers like so: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>terraform</span> {
  <span>required_providers</span> {
    hcloud <span>=</span> {
      source <span>=</span> <span>"hetznercloud/hcloud"</span>
    }
    template <span>=</span> {
      source <span>=</span> <span>"hashicorp/template"</span>
    }
  }
  required_version <span>=</span> "&gt;<span>=</span> <span>0</span>.<span>13</span><span>"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This configuration goes in a <code>versions.tf</code> file in the <code>basic-vms</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="configure-terraform---virtual-servers">Configure Terraform - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>Now that we have created an API token and configured the provider, we can create our Hetzner Cloud virtual servers.</p>
<p>Run <code>terraform init</code> to download and install the provider: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ terraform init 

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

- Installed hetznercloud/hcloud v1.20.1 <span>(</span>signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 5219EACB3A77198B<span>)</span>
- Installing hashicorp/template v2.1.2...
- Installed hashicorp/template v2.1.2 <span>(</span>signed by HashiCorp<span>)</span>

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you<span>'</span>d like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html

The following providers <span>do</span> not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* hashicorp/template: version <span>=</span> <span>"~&gt; 2.1.2"</span>
* hetznercloud/hcloud: version <span>=</span> <span>"~&gt; 1.20.1"</span>

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running <span>"terraform plan"</span> to see
any changes that are required <span>for</span> your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration <span>for</span> Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to <span>do</span> so <span>if</span> necessary.
</code></pre></div><h3 id="define-the-infrastructure---virtual-servers">Define the infrastructure - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>You can now create the configuration files for your first virtual server. The below is from the file <code>hcloud.tf</code> in the <code>terraform/basic-vms</code> directory: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"hcloud_server" "yetiops-blog"</span> {
  name               <span>=</span> <span>"yetiops-blog"</span>
  image              <span>=</span> <span>"ubuntu-20.04"</span>
  server_type        <span>=</span> <span>"cx11"</span>
  user_data          <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>template_file</span>.<span>ubuntu</span>.<span>rendered</span>
  ssh_keys           <span>=</span> [
    <span>hcloud_ssh_key</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>ssh</span><span>-</span><span>key</span>.<span>name</span>
  ]
  labels <span>=</span> {
    "prometheus" <span>=</span> <span>"true"</span>,
    "node_exporter" <span>=</span> <span>"true"</span>
  }
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"hcloud_ssh_key" "yetiops-ssh-key"</span> {
  name       <span>=</span> <span>"yetiops-ssh-key"</span>
  public_key <span>=</span> <span>file</span>(<span>"~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"</span>)
}

<span>output</span> <span>"yetiops_blog_ipv4"</span> {
  value <span>=</span> <span>hcloud_server</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>blog</span>.<span>ipv4_address</span>
}

<span>output</span> <span>"yetiops_blog_ipv6"</span> {
  value <span>=</span> <span>hcloud_server</span>.<span>yetiops</span><span>-</span><span>blog</span>.<span>ipv6_address</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Compared to some of the other posts, we are creating a small amount of infrastructure. This is because: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Hetzner Cloud does not provide firewall/security group resources (like an AWS Security Group or a Digital Ocean Firewall)</li>
<li>While you can specify a datacentre, Hetzner will choose one at random if you do not (rather than it being a prerequisite of creating an instance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hetzner Cloud instances support labels for instances (consisting of key-value pairs). These can then be used to filter/match instances with Prometheus later.</p>
<p>We have also added some Terraform outputs as well. Outputs can be used in Terraform modules to expose attributes to state files that call the modules, or they can be used to show information when Terraform finishes an <code>apply</code> operation.</p>
<p>One part that does differ from our previous posts is that we extend the <code>user-data</code> being provided. This create a basic host-based firewall (leveraging <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW">UFW</a>) on the server: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span>
<span>packages</span>:
 - prometheus-node-exporter

<span>ufw_enable</span>:
  - <span>&amp;ufw_enable</span> <span>|
</span><span>    ufw allow from ${my_ip}</span>
    ufw enable

<span>runcmd</span>:
   - [ sh, -c, <span>*ufw_enable</span> ]
</code></pre></div><p>We now also need to supply our IP as part of this: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"template_file" "ubuntu"</span> {
  template <span>=</span> <span>"${file("${path.module}/files/ubuntu.tpl")}"</span>
  vars <span>=</span> {
    my_ip <span>=</span> <span>"###MY PUBLIC IP ADDRESS###"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>You could also use IPTables, nftables, firewalld or any other host-based firewall of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="build-the-infrastructure---virtual-servers">Build the infrastructure - Virtual Servers</h3>
<p>We can now apply our configuration, and see if it builds a Hetzner Cloud virtual server: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ terraform apply
data.template_file.ubuntu: Refreshing state...
data.template_cloudinit_config.ubuntu: Refreshing state...

				<p>The conventional wisdom for app subscriptions is to price affordably, like $1.99/month, and hopefully attract lots of subscribers at a low price. Then by having low pricing, fewer will reject the idea of subscriptions, and you’ll make up the difference with volume. But this is the wrong approach…</p>

<p><b>The reality is most people won’t sign up for your subscription even at a low price. </b>Most people dislike subscriptions, and many won’t subscribe at any cost.&nbsp;The recurring nature of subscriptions provides a major mental hurdle and makes them hard to commit to.</p>
<p>However, you likely have a smaller set of users who get the most value out of your app and are willing to subscribe. These are your most devoted and die-hard users. When designing your subscription plan you want to focus on these users, they are the ones who will pay and stick around (see my <a href="https://mronge.com/how-churn-can-limit-your-subscription-business/">post on churn</a> for why this is critical). <strong>By going subscription, you are choosing to focus on fewer customers but your most dedicated customers.</strong> Given that this is a much smaller customer base, you need to charge a higher price.</p>
<p>There is such a mental barrier with subscriptions that once someone is willing to purchase, they are likely less price sensitive. If someone is willing to buy at $1.99/month, they are very likely to buy at $4.99/month or even $7.99/month. Our surveys conducted before launching Astropad Studio show this as well:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Price</strong></td>
<td>
<p>$50 One-time</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$20 Yearly</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$50 Yearly</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$100 Yearly</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Conversion %</strong></td>
<td>
<p>45%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>38%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>21%</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>15%</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Revenue per 10k visitors</strong></td>
<td>
<p>$223,549</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$75,524</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$106,007</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>$147,887</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This is real data from a test on potential pricing schemes for a new app. The first thing you’ll notice is that people are much more willing to make a one-time purchase.</p>
<p>Second, if we compare the number of people willing to purchase a $20/year subscription vs. the number of people ready to buy a $100/year subscription, you’ll notice that 2.5x fewer people are willing to pay $100/year<b>.</b> But while we have 2.5x fewer people at $100/year, our price has gone up by 5x! Looking at the estimates for revenue per 10,000 visitors clearly shows as well, <b>we would make 2x as much revenue at $100/year than we would at just $20/year!</b></p>
<p>So if you’re going to make the switch to subscription (and I’ll be writing another post on why I think it is the right choice for productivity apps) you should focus on your best customers and charge them more. Not only will you generate more revenue with which to grow, but customers that purchase at higher prices tend to churn less (and we know <a href="https://mronge.com/how-churn-can-limit-your-subscription-business/">how churn can be a killer</a>). So raise your subscription prices!</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Everybody claims to be a software company these days. From the nearly decade old pronouncement by Marc Andressen that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">“Software Is Eating the World”</a> to the push from Wall Street to produce recurring software revenue; the pressure is on to claim - at least - that you are a software company. <br></p><p>This is obviously problematic for appliance vendors. Try as they might, it does not take much inspection to determine which ones have become truly software defined, and which ones are hoping to use financial engineering to fake it until they get there. <br></p><p>Either way, the ongoing debate about which is better, software defined storage or hardware storage appliances. Is pretty much over. <br></p><p>Like Marc predicted, software won. <br></p><p>We need to start with a clear definition of software defined storage. First of all, it is software. It most likely started as software too - it wasn’t “extracted” from a proprietary hardware platform. <br></p><p>Software defined storage should run on multiple customer servers with direct access storage (DAS) SSDs or disk drives or JBoDs (just a bunch of disks) or JBoF (just a bunch of flash) shelves that are SAS/NVMe attached to the servers. <br></p><p>True software defined storage doesn’t run on a narrow list of pre-approved boxes - that is just hardware defined storage with choices. Software defined storage should run on almost anything. For example a <a href="https://github.com/christianbaun/ossperf/wiki/Minio-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-with-Raspbian-(Debian-Jessie-8.0)">Raspberry Pi</a>. Or <a href="https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-POWER-whitepaper-HR.pdf">IBM Power9 infrastructure</a>. Or anything <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware">in-between</a>.<br></p><p>Hardware defined storage (appliances) combine server and storage hardware and software into one packaged solution that a customer buys whole from that vendor. Hardware defined storage is normally deployed by vendor personnel and can take the form of rackable hardware with vendor covers but underneath, is typically two or more servers with SAS or NVMe storage shelves attached. Hardware defined storage vendors provide the internal networking to connect the multiple servers and storage together. The appliance vendor personnel are responsible for servicing the appliance server and storage hardware as well as the storage software. <br></p><p>Let’s break it down further shall we?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Software Defined</th>
<th>Hardware Defined/Appliance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Superior. The customer supplies <br>their own servers &amp; storage <br>designed for the price/performance <br>configuration the deployment <br>calls for.</td>
<td>Worse. The storage vendor supplies <br>all of the hardware,<br>software and service for <br>the solution. Difficult to unbundle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Dependent on what is provisioned. <br>True high performance SDS on <br>fast HW and a fast network <br>outperforms even the “fast” <br>appliance vendors. This trend<br>will only continue. To be sure, <br>there will be niche cases <br>- but fast software is the <br>starting point.</td>
<td>Vendors optimize hardware and <br>software to get the most <br>performance and availability <br>out of the system. Price/Performance <br>curves are pretty linear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Better, as these are deployed <br>as a storage cluster, they <br>can often range from 3-4 nodes<br>to 100s of nodes and anything<br>in between.</td>
<td>Worse. Appliances typically come <br>with dual (server) controllers<br>and can typically scale up<br>to 4 of these (8 servers) <br>but generally not much higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fault <br>tolerance</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>treats failure as a normal event. <br>Done well, clusters seamlessly <br>redirect, heal or recover. <br>Sophisticated erasure-coding <br>and bitrot protection are software<br>inventions - and ensure manageability is <br>prioritized.</td>
<td>Appliances are generally optimized<br>for providing high levels of<br>fault tolerance. They are <br>typically deployed with dual <br>controllers that quickly failover <br>when one dies and provide <br>sophisticated storage protection <br>policies. Replacing the appliance <br>is not the same, however, as <br>replacing COTS hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API driven. These APIs typically <br>support most DevOps and <br>infrastructure automation and <br>monitoring packages currently <br>deployed in a data center.</td>
<td>Appliances generally support a <br>GUI first and APIs as second-class<br>citizens, if at all. This limits <br>automation and application failure <br>management. It is why most appliances<br>are only used for archival and not <br>modern apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration <br>flexibility</td>
<td>Customers deploy these solutions <br>on whatever performance and <br>capacity they want (within HCLs). <br>The configuration flexibility is <br>nearly infinite - critical when <br>considering the modern range <br>(data center to edge).</td>
<td>Appliances typically limit options <br>to very specific offerings, <br>generally 3-5 models are available <br>with DRAM &amp; capacity limits for <br>each model. Performance is often <br>limited by the appliance model <br>selected. Mixing and matching <br>models is a no-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trialability</td>
<td>Want to try out software <br>defined storage - download it <br>and get started. If your <br>provider is truly open source<br>- what you are playing with <br>is the same software their <br>best customers run.</td>
<td>Appliances must be made available <br>to the customer on their data <br>center premises or at some other <br>test facility to be tried out. <br>Massive friction in the sales process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgradeability</td>
<td>Customers can switch out <br>current servers or storage <br>with better ones anytime <br>they want and do <br>this themselves.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors generally <br>offer only specific model <br>upgrades to appliances which <br>have to be purchased and <br>are typically done by vendor <br>personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of installation</td>
<td>Better. As customers add <br>server or storage hardware <br>and deploy software on servers <br>all the time, they <br>can deploy software defined <br>storage on current or new servers <br>anytime they want.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors personnel are <br>typically used to deploy the <br>appliances. This may require <br>cross scheduling of data center <br>and vendor service personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of operations</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API first, but also supports <br>GUIs and/or are integrated <br>into larger solution interfaces <br>(think MinIO + Cisco).</td>
<td>Application vendors have invested <br>heavily in their GUI’s and <br>they are typically fully featured. <br>A good GUI can be a powerful form<br>of lock-in with IT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature <br>update frequency</td>
<td>True software defined storage <br>releases continuously. Often weekly. <br>Customers consume those on <br>demand. This means more features, <br>better security and less disruption.</td>
<td>Worse. Due to their tight <br>performance and availability <br>optimizations, testing must often <br>be more stringent and take <br>longer. This lengthens the interval <br>between feature <br>updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Footprint <br>density</td>
<td>Density traditionally favored appliances <br>- but with boxes like this, <br>that gap has been eliminated.</td>
<td>Appliances control the hardware, <br>and target the densest storage<br>shelves available - even if that<br>requires proprietary hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware <br>reuseability</td>
<td>Customers can take server and storage <br>hardware out of the cluster anytime <br>they wish and deploy this <br>for other uses. Licensing <br>terms may or may not need <br>to be changed. Server maintenance <br>options are at the discretion <br>of the customer and their <br>server vendor.</td>
<td>Other than using older appliances <br>as slower storage (aka boat anchors) <br>there’s not much that can be done <br>with it. However, to continue <br>to  use appliances as (slower) <br>storage , vendor maintenance contracts <br>will need to be maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Complexity</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>abstracts complexity. Great software <br>defined storage eliminates it.</td>
<td>A rare bright spot for appliance <br>vendors, the lack of flexibility <br>drives homogeneity and therefore <br>some semblance of simplicity. <br>It is why IT can be fiercely loyal<br>to their vendors.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Ultimately, there is a place for both solutions in the market today but the world is changing. <br></p><p>It burns a lot of cash to run a hardware appliance business. It ties up capital, requires large field sales and field sales support. Appliances are not built for the world we live in today. Further, as we have most famously pointed out - you <a href="https://blog.min.io/high-performance-object-storage-with-kubernetes/">can’t containerize an appliance</a>. Given that Kubernetes is the new normal - it is going to be increasingly difficult to make a living slinging steel. <br></p><p>That is why everyone is eager to say they are a “software-company” these days. Truth is, if their website is adorned with boxes showcasing their logo - it is not a software company. When they tweet a win and show some boxes, that is what they sold - not software. Just because for 45 mins every three months they say words like “revenue from software subscriptions” doesn’t mean they are a software company - it means they are on their quarterly analyst call. <br></p><p>So think about what you really want to achieve. If you want high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage - choose software. If you want modern application support in addition to archival - choose software. If you want flexibility to design to your use case - choose software. <br></p><p>Don’t, however, choose hardware masquerading as software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>It's what every Node developer fears: the process that keeps eating memory and won't stop, or the infamous <code>ENOMEM</code> code being returned by your <code>child_process</code> calls. That's right we're talking about memory leaks today folks, and more specifically the NodeJS kind.</p>
<p>However, instead of taking a look at all the tools and packages out there, and going over each, I'd like to share the things that we used that directly lead us to find our particular leak. Unfortunately this will require you to install at least one package in your app and call it somehow, whether that be on a regular interval or via a triggered event of some kind. In any event, below is how we found, diagnosed, and fixed a particular memory leak that caused us some headaches in browserless.</p>
<!-- truncate -->
<h2>Install heapdump</h2>
<p>The first thing we reached for was the <code>npm</code> package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/heapdump"><code>heapdump</code></a>. This little utility generates portable <code>heapsnapshot</code>'s of V8's heap, which you can then directly import later into Chromium to debug (more on that later).</p>
<p>As for browserless, we decided to conditionally mount a route that exposes this functionality. The internals for <code>heapdump</code> are a little goofy since it <em>has</em> to write to disk, so you'll have to take that into consideration for your use-case.</p>
<p><strong>The heapdump route</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> os = <span>require</span>(<span>'os'</span>);
<span>const</span> rimraf = <span>require</span>(<span>'rimraf'</span>);
<span>const</span> _ = <span>require</span>(<span>'lodash'</span>);

<span>if</span> (process.env.NODE_ENV !== <span>'production'</span>) {
  <span>const</span> heapdump = <span>require</span>(<span>'heapdump'</span>);

  router.get(<span>'/heapdump'</span>, (req, res) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> heapLocation = path.join(os.tmpdir(), <span>`heap-<span>${<span>Date</span>.now()}</span>.heapsnapshot`</span>);
    heapdump.writeSnapshot(heapLocation, (err) =&gt; {
      <span>if</span> (err) {
        <span>return</span> res.status(<span>500</span>).send(err.message);
      }

      <span>return</span> res.sendFile(heapLocation, () =&gt; rimraf(heapLocation, (_.noop)));
    });
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that we handle all the of details of the writing, sending, and deletion of this heap file. Be warned that the <code>heapdump.writeSnapshot</code> call is <em>expensive</em> as it effectively stops the single-process JavaScript runtime so that a dump can be made. This means that this isn't something you want to run on all your production machines -- and I wouldn't do so on any production machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>By no means should you run this route in your production infrastructure!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our purposes in debugging this leak, we instead built local docker images to hammer with traffic for the sole purpose of finding this issue. If this isn't an option, or if you don't have a way to test these changes in some kind of isolation, then you have bigger problems than a memory leak on your hands. We can't stress this enough: find a way to implement this in an isolated fashion.</p>
<p>Good? Now let's run some traffic!</p>
<h2>Make some traffic</h2>
<p>For browserless, since we expose a interface for puppeteer and playwright to hook into, we spun up our docker image with the below command:</p>
<pre><code>
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e ENABLE_HEAP_DUMP=<span>true</span> --rm --name browserless -d browserless/chrome:dev
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously you'll need to start your application with whatever it needs in order to run. After we got up and running, we did a cURL call to to our <code>/heapdump</code> route and got our first heapsnapshot. It's really important to get a "clean" snapshot before any processing or traffic happens, as we use this as a baseline for comparing later snapshots. It's nearly impossible to find a leak with doing some kind of comparison.</p>
<pre><code>
curl -o start.heapsnapshot http://localhost:3000/heapdump
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have our app up, and a baseline snapshot for comparing, let's run generate some traffic. For our purposes we simply wanted to generate a lot of connections and removals to see if that invoked our memory issue. This let us try out thousands of sessions to see if there was an issue in how we collect statistics of the machine itself, or if something else was at play.</p>
<p><strong>Simulate load</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> puppeteer = <span>require</span>(<span>'puppeteer'</span>);

<span>const</span> PARALLEL = <span>20</span>;
<span>const</span> SAMPLE = <span>100000</span>;

<span>let</span> currentIdx = <span>0</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Stress testing with <span>${SAMPLE.toLocaleString()}</span> iterations.`</span>);

setInterval(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`On iteration: <span>${currentIdx.toLocaleString()}</span>.`</span>);
}, <span>5000</span>);

<span>const</span> run = <span>async</span> () =&gt; {
  <span>if</span> (currentIdx &gt;= SAMPLE) {
    <span>return</span>;
  }
  <span>let</span> browser;
  currentIdx++;

  <span>try</span> {
    browser = <span>await</span> puppeteer.connect({
      <span>browserWSEndpoint</span>: <span>'ws://localhost:3000'</span>
    });
  } <span>catch</span> (err) {
    <span>console</span>.error(err);
  } <span>finally</span> {
    browser &amp;&amp; browser.close();
    <span>return</span> run();
  }
};

<span>Promise</span>.all([...new <span>Array</span>(PARALLEL)].map(run))
  .then(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Complete!'</span>)
    process.exit(<span>0</span>);
  })
  .catch(<span>(<span>e</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.error(<span>`Error running stress script: <span>${e}</span>`</span>);
    process.exit(<span>1</span>);
  });

</code></pre>
<p>Once done, you'll simply have to wait. Depending on your case this could take a few minutes or even hours, so let things run for a bit and come back once you've got enough load generated.</p>
<hr>
<p>OK! Time's up! Let's get our second snapshot for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>
curl -o end.heapsnapshot http://localhost:3000/heapdump
</code></pre>
<h2>Load up your Chrome browser</h2>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with devtools on Chrome, then this is the part where I say go watch a few videos on that (seriously). Both NodeJS and Chrome share the same-ish V8 runtime, which means you can do cool stuff like profile and debug Node applications with Chrome! But in order to do that you'll need to have some familiarity with it, so please go do so now!</p>
<p>Once you're ready, open a new tab. The <code>about:blank</code> page is good as nothing happens on it, keeping everything clean. Once done open devtools.</p>
<p><strong>DevTools link</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/devtools.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>After that you'll want to click the Memory tab to open the comparison tool we're after.</p>
<p><strong>Memory Tab</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/memory-tab.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>Down below, you'll want to click that "Load" button the bottom of the frame. What this does is allow you to load the existing snapshots we've made into Chromium's debugger. You'll have to do each snapshot individually, and renaming them is helpful so you know when they were taken. In our case, we had both <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> snapshots, so it made it easy for us to distinguish what was what.</p>
<p>Once you've loaded all your snapshots, your a few clicks away from more information than you can possibly ever need. Start by clicking the <em>last</em> snapshot in time (for us the <code>end</code> one). Then click the "Summary" tab and change it to "Comparison". Finally, sort by "Size Delta" ensuring that the biggest is first, or descending order.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison view</strong>
<img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/comparison.png" rel="Chrome Devtools"></p>
<p>What we're after here is Objects that are <em>growing</em> over time and never collected. In plain language, we're essentially telling Chrome that we want to compare these snapshots, and show us objects that have grown over time and are never collected.</p>
<p>Once done, you'll want to start clicking around the bottom half the page (Retainers). This give us some context on what it is that's growing and never being reaped.</p>
<h2>Leak location</h2>
<p>This next part, I'll admit, is somewhat confusing. We're essentially looking for anything in these never-collected objects that might trigger our "spider-sense" that there's an issue. Some of it is internal to Node, which will look like complete gibberish, and it's quite possible that your leak is in some other library or package. There's a lot of system strings that are quite biggish (which are your modules loaded into memory), so be sure to not get suspicious of those. It took us quite a bit of digging around, but the leak is found here:</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.browserless.io/img/leak-debug.gif" rel="Clicking around the debugger"></p>
<p>You'll notice that we instinctively clicked on the first item in this array object, and we're presented with a bunch of Objects below. Looking again at the "Retained Size", we immediately spotted that there's a huge <code>SIGHUP</code> object staying around. This is made even more clear by the fact that the lower "Retained Size" column is showing that these objects never get reaped again.</p>
<p>Clicking around, we also noticed that some other growing objects referenced these <code>SIGHUP</code> objects as well. Since browserless itself doesn't handle this signal, something somewhere must be. After searching around our <code>node_modules</code> libraries we found one culprit: <code>puppeteer</code>.</p>
<h2>Fixing the leak</h2>
<p>Now, puppeteer isn't directly responsible for this issue, however it does attach a lot of process handlers (not just <code>SIGHUP</code>, but <code>exit</code> and others). These do get closed when calling <code>browser.close()</code> -- which wasn't something that we were doing! Instead, we <code>disconnected</code> from the browser, and sent our own process kill message to it. When running many instance of puppeteer in a server environment, this becomes problematic, especially in docker.</p>
<p>In docker, we do signal handling manually by binding our own event listeners and forwarding that intention to all running browser instances in order to close gracefully. Once done, we <em>then</em> exit the process, meaning that puppeteer doesn't really need to handle any of that for us. Luckily their API exposes what events to bind to <em>except</em> for the <code>exit</code> event. This means that we fixed this leak by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Telling puppeteer <em>not</em> to handle signals (<a href="https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&amp;version=v5.2.1&amp;show=api-puppeteerlaunchoptions">see their API here</a>).</li>
<li>Triggering its event cleanup process by using <code>browser.close</code> instead of <code>browser.disconnect</code>.</li>
<li>Since the <code>exit</code> handler isn't always reaped by <code>browser.close()</code> in cases of crashes, we force it by periodically calling <code>process.removeAllListeners('exit')</code>. <strong>Be careful with this one</strong>, it's a ham-fisted way to make sure exit events get removed, and can cause issues if other parts of your app are expecting this. We'll be adjusting this once we find a better mechanism for doing so.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Going forward you can prevent a lot of memory issues by following best-practices in Node. Removing events when done, <code>null</code>-ing old references and cleaning up long arrays are great ways of ensuring your app is lite on memory. In times of peril these aren't necessarily helpful, however, and you'll need to to snapshot V8 directly and do some comparisons to find where your issue is.</p>
<p>We also thought it'd be interesting to expose these heapdumps we have to you as well, so feel free to <a href="https://docs.browserless.io/bin/heapdumps.tar.gz">download them here and see what you think</a>. This will give you a chance to play around in devtools and get familiar with the process before you need it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This month, US president Donald Trump was asked an offhand question about QAnon. "I've heard these are people that love our country… so I don't know, really anything about it, other than they do supposedly like me," he said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-praises-qanon-followers-as-people-that-love-our-country-11597883634">during a press briefing</a>. "If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it."&nbsp;<br></p><p>It may seem like an innocuous remark, but it's hard to imagine it was genuine. QAnon is the purveyor of one of the wildest and most pervasive conspiracy theories running through American politics. Based on the cryptic ravings of an anonymous imageboard user named "Q," the theory's adherents believe that Donald Trump is working to ferret out a global satanic pedophilic sex ring secretly supported by elements of the Democratic Party and the "deep state" within the U.S. government.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The group is now holding rallies in numerous cities, ostensibly to combat child sex trafficking. At least one open QAnon believer, Marjorie Taylor Greene, has won a Republican primary in Georgia to run for the House of Representatives. Trump, of course, tweeted his support: "Marjorie is strong on everything and never gives up - a real WINNER!"<br></p><p>QAnon may sound like&nbsp; something that could only have birthed in the darker corners of the internet. But QAnon predates president Donald Trump and even the internet itself;&nbsp; It’s just the latest iteration of a moral panic that swept the highest levels of Western society only a generation ago. One&nbsp; of the most polarizing and divisive social movements in modern history; it destroyed families, turned communities against one another, and sent numerous innocent men and women to prison.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And it all started in Victoria, BC.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a643a027884838fbbb5f5_Michelle.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Michelle Proby, in this image from the 1980 book Michelle Remembers, recalling "repressed" memories of Satanic abuse while under hypnosis. </figcaption></figure><p>It was known as the Satanic Panic; a conspiracy theory that convinced millions of well meaning and rational people that a secret cabal of Satanists had infiltrated the highest echelons of society in order to sexually molest children. The Satanists were accused of sacrificing animals and using women as "breeders" to create an endless supply of dead babies for use in their gory, bloody-fuelled rituals and orgies. <br></p><p>It destroyed lives and ripped apart families. Reports of ritualistic child abuse were reported across the English speaking-world. Almost all of them were eventually found to have been partially, or wholly fabricated, but not before dozens of innocent people were falsely accused, and sentenced to years and even decades in prison.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Born of a genuine historical injustice — society's neglect of childhood sexual abuse — this was a panic that saw some of the world’s smartest minds taken in by accusations, that, at their root, were as preposterous as any raised during medieval European witch hunts. It&nbsp; was legitimized by a professional class, captivated law enforcement and proved itself a lucrative grift for fraudsters and attention seekers. Worse, as the conspiracy grew under its own weight and influence, the hysteria inspired real and horrific crimes — usually by disturbed teenagers who claimed they were sacrificing humans to Satan.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is a case study of how badly off the rails we can go when we allow our best intentions and passions to overwhelm us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a53aa6f49f67c5ee88823_1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The Fort Royal Medical Centre, located just across the street from Royal Jubilee Hospital, where Lawrence Pazder used to have his office and where he first met Michelle Proby (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>The story begins in 1980, with the publication of a book called Michelle Remembers. It detailed the fantastic claims of Michelle Proby, who recounted several months of gory and sadistic ritualistic abuse at the hands of a cabal of Satanists when she was a child in 1950s Victoria. The memories, she alleged, were repressed for decades, until she sought help from psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder. Under a state of hypnosis, Proby began to uncover a horrifying tale of murder, torture, abduction, and molestation. She claimed to have been taken from her willing family and groomed to take part in a ritual to call the devil — one in which she witnessed the murder of children, was forced to eat human remains, covered in dead baby parts, and locked in a cage with snakes. <br></p><p>An explosive bestseller. Michelle Remembers would become the folkloric template for countless other claims of Satanic Ritual Abuse ostensibly uncovered during therapy during the 80s and 90s.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On its face, the book seems too implausible to take seriously. But neither Michelle Proby nor Lawrence Pazder gave anyone the impression of being loony, hysterical, or liars. Proby was a married woman living an ordinary life in Victoria. Measured and even-tempered, with close cropped curly dark hair and a soft-spoken, feminine lilt to her speech.<br></p><p>Pazder, her psychiatrist, was by all accounts a brilliant family man, a respected professional psychologist and a devout Catholic.<br></p><p>In 1973, Proby began to visit Pazder to seek treatment for depression. After four years of regular therapy sessions, the pair had worked through Proby's ordinary childhood issues and, it was clear, that their sessions were coming to a natural close. Then, in 1976,&nbsp; Proby suffered a miscarriage and began to experience horrible nightmares. Pazder was called in to help.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had a bad dream last week," she said in one of these first sessions, as described in Michelle Remembers.<br></p><p>"A bad dream?" replied Pazder.&nbsp;<br></p><p>"Yes … a very bad dream,” she said before describing a terrifying dream about scratching an itch on her hand only to have the skin rupture with spiders. “Little spiders, just pouring out of the skin on my hand. It was just --I can't even tell you how it was.”<br></p><p>From there, the sessions began to delve into increasingly bizarre territory. Proby would slip into a kind of hypnotic trance, in which she began to recount long-forgotten events in the childlike voice of her five-year-old self.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a537298ddd30d653f4410_4.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>2078 Newton Street, the childhood home of Michelle Proby, where she alleged the basement was frequently used for Satanic rituals involving snakes and body parts from stillborn babies (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>Over the following 14 months, the pair recorded 600 hours of testimony in this state. It was this work that would become the basis of Michelle Remembers. Funded by a $100,000 advance in 1980 dollars, it would earn another $242,000 in paperback rights and royalties — worth more than $1 million in 2020 currency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At first, the events Proby remembered were merely horrific. She began to remember some kind of orgiastic party at a home in the Victoria neighbourhood where guests clubbed a woman to death She remembered an evil man named Malachai, who packed a car with the dead woman's body and then faked an accident on the Malahat highway in order to cover up the murder. She then recalled being forced to eat the dead victim's ashes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As the sessions wore on, the remembering grew more dramatic, detailed and overtly paranormal. While she was at first merely an unwilling participant in Satanic rituals, Proby claimed she was eventually kidnapped by a group that the pair would come to identify as a Victoria-based Satanic cult.<br></p><p>She described rituals performed at night at the city’s historic Ross Bay Cemetery; being placed in an opened grave while a crying cat mewled and a woman dressed in a dark robe chanted above her. She remembered a bizarre ritual of rebirth in a nearby mausoleum, her tormentors hissing and dancing like cats while one of them licked her.<br></p><p>Each session with Pazder built on the horror of the one before, eventually becoming so nightmarish that the therapist brought in priests to offer blessings and benedictions to protect Proby from the evil of her own memory.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Eventually, Proby said that she was saved by the miraculous intervention of Jesus and the Virgin Mary — who appeared to her in the midst of a Satanic ritual.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taken together, the book's claims seem so extraordinary — and its evidence so thin — that it becomes difficult to imagine anyone believing Proby's utterances to be literally true.&nbsp;</p><p>And indeed, Michelle Remembers’ central claims can all be debunked with even cursory investigation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There is no evidence of a fatal car crash on the Malahat highway in the time period that the book covers. The Ross Bay Cemetery mausoleum pictured in the book was too tiny to accommodate several people and a Satanic ritual.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/5f4a540a9559045712412701_2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>The mausoleum of BC&nbsp;politician Harry Helmcken. The tiny structure was identified in Michelle Remembers as having hosted a large and elaborate Satanic gathering (Alex Abraham). </figcaption></figure><p>Proby's two siblings <a href="https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1980/10/27/things-that-go-bump-in-victoria#!&amp;pid=32">did not corroborate any of her claims</a>. One sibling contacted by The Capital said only that she did not want to talk about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>There's no evidence that Proby suffered a prolonged absence from school during the events described. Besides a dentist's letter confirming a bashed tooth, and a photo of a skin rash, she wasn’t found to have any physical scars of the intensive abuse she had claimed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Most heartbreaking of all, Proby's estranged father told Britain’s The Mail on Sunday that the claims were entirely false and that Proby had grotesquely misrepresented her late mother.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was the worst pack of lies a little girl could ever make up. The book took me four months to read, and I cried all the time. I kept saying to myself: ’Dear God, how could anyone do this to their dead mother?’" Jack Proby told reporters in 1990.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In normal circumstances, such off-the-wall claims might have generated little interest. But Pazder was a difficult man to dismiss. He was a respected psychologist with impeccable credentials; degrees from the Universities of Alberta School of Medicine, the University of Liverpool, and McGill, in addition to being a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, a staff member at local hospitals. Pazder was also deeply religious, and it was likely no coincidence that Proby's recollections came to starkly confirm his own faith.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When Michelle Remembers hit bookshelves, Proby’s account even had …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Even before the pandemic, there were a few companies choosing to work shorter weeks. In Japan, Microsoft gave it a try in later part of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> and found that doing so increased productivity, reduced stress, and lessened employee burnout. It also had the added benefit of lowering operating costs for that month.</p><p>With COVID-19, average work environments have become even more stressful. Places like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/24/will-coronavirus-pandemic-open-door-four-day-workweek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> are acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" solution to helping companies recover or thrive through the global pandemic.</p><p>What would happen if your company decided to run fewer days per week? Would you discover the same benefits as other companies? To answer this question for yourself, you will have to test the theory in your own company. However, to help you, we have looked to find out how other companies are dealing with COVID-19 and what they have gained from switching to a <a href="https://30hourjobs.com/4-day-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-day work week</a>.</p><h2 id="buffer">Buffer</h2><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a> became a company that chose to experiment for a single month. Their goal was to reduce the stress that employees and teammates were dealing with because of the global crisis. In June, the company decided to continue their May experiment to last the rest of 2020.</p><p>Why the change from "experiment" to full-time? The answer to this is in the feedback provided by their teammates. It seems unanimous that everyone experienced lower stress levels, increased work happiness, and less burnout. Employees worked more efficiently and effectively in their four days because of how relaxed they felt.</p><p>Although it is only something they are trying for the rest of the year, there is hope that it will continue to prove such an undeniable success.</p><h2 id="elephant-ventures">Elephant Ventures</h2><p><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/4-day-work-week-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant Ventures</a> has been doing 4-day work weeks in the Philippines for the past five years. They have noticed that across the board there is an increase in productivity because workers feel it balances out the work-life scenarios that we all have to face in the workforce.</p><p>In early June, the company closed its doors on their brick and mortar offices in the US. At the time, there was reasonable certainty that the doors would remain closed. However, in August, they decided that this was not what they truly wanted and began trying to come up with a way to meet the needs of clients in the "post Covid-19" world and take tips from their Philippines offices.</p><p>It is a little too soon to tell whether it is an absolute success or not. This does not mean that there isn't a hope that clients and employees will all be happy working this shorter workweek.</p><h2 id="shopify">Shopify</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/remote-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify's</a> employees have embraced the remote/in-office way of working for years. However, in March 2020, they closed the door and went fully remote in an effort to "flatten the curve". The fact that they are working in a digital space by default, has made the transition much easier for them than traditional brick and mortar businesses. They already understand that eliminating bad work habits and strengthening healthier ones is beneficial to everyone.</p><p>In June, Shopify once again changed things up and announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/postcarl/status/1272676581165727746" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> that they would reserve Friday as the day for R&amp;R. Their goal at the time was to enjoy the shorter work week through August. It remains to be seen whether it is extended or not.</p><h2 id="shake-shack">Shake Shack</h2><p>For more than a year, Shake Shack has been <a href="https://www.wabe.org/enjoy-the-extra-day-off-more-bosses-give-4-day-workweek-a-try/" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing</a> the theory of shorter work weeks makes for happier employees. It began with a test run in Las Vegas to give managers an extra day off from work each week, while providing them with the typical 40-hour work week benefits. This means the same pay for fewer hours. With the success of it, the gradually spread out the "testing phase" to include more locations.</p><p>Their findings over the last year, is that employees, especially moms, appreciate working a shorter week because it gives them an extra day to spend with their families. This makes them feel better about being at work, because they do not miss out on taking kids to school, running errands on their day off, and more.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold of the US and all other areas of the globe, <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shake Shack</a> did what it could to care for its employees. They still strive to do what they can for the communities that they are a part of.</p><h2 id="radioactive-public-relations">Radioactive Public Relations</h2><p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.radioactivepr.com/agency-impact-1-year-4-day-pay-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radioactive Public Relations</a> reached their one-year benchmark for working shorter work weeks. They were one of the first companies in the UK to give shorter weeks a try and quickly decided to extend their "test" phase.</p><p>Why was the test phase extended? The answer to this is simple. Employees were taking fewer sick days, recruitment was on the rise, business was growing, and employees were happier across the board. The employee happiness reasoning has ranged from enjoying the time with their families to doing things that they wouldn't be able to do if they worked a traditional work week.</p><h2 id="perpetual-guardian">Perpetual Guardian</h2><p>This New Zealand-based company was one of the first to jump on board with shorter work weeks. Andrew Barnes, founder of <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perpetual Guardian</a>, began testing the water with it in 2018. Since then, they have discovered that it encourages employees to work harder while encouraging staff members to organize their time more efficiently while at work.</p><p>Overall, it has lowered the stress level of all who work within the company by allowing them to have more of a life outside the office. Employees can now use their time to take up hobbies, spend time with loved ones, return to school for extra studies, and much more.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about balancing your work/life schedule or want to know more about transitioning to a shorter work week, we are here for you. You can contact us, join our newsletter, and more. Our goal at <a href="https://jobs.30hourjobs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Hour Jobs</a> is to ensure everyone works the way they want to work.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-romano-517179145/">Federico Romano</a></p>



<p>In recent days&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>, founded by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>, presented its&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w">advances and possible applications</a>&nbsp;of the controversial brain chip that with thousands of high-tech electrodes will be able to (in the not so distant future) increase our cognitive abilities, cure neurological diseases of great morbidity and merge us with artificial intelligence in a concept that until recently was just science fiction, the symbiosis between humans and computers.</p>



<p>From the presentation, opinions of all kinds arose that show how much the great technological advances make us reconsider our worldview, and the big question: where are we heading with this Neurotechnological revolution that is here to stay and will have a great leap towards the mass public in 2021.</p>



<p>The expectations are enormous, the essence of the human being and its entire evolutionary history focuses on its brain capacity. While Neuralink’s team of experts led by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/max_hodak">Max Hodak</a>&nbsp;is advancing by leaps and bounds, there is a great chasm of experimentation, validation and understanding of how neurons encode information before being able to load data directly into our brain through intracranial implants.This is mentioned by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/tomoxl?lang=en">Thomas Oaxley</a>, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.synchronmed.com/">Synchron</a>, an Australian company that is also developing a system to insert brain probes. Oaxley says effective results should not be expected soon, as the technology is not advanced enough to achieve this. However, he believes that because Musk is willing to invest large amounts of money in his company, it will be “exciting to see what he will develop.” And of course, it will be, the futuristic tech mogul seems to take things seriously.</p>

<p>Is it possible that Neurotechnology enhances our capabilities even before the arrival of Neuralink in the future? The answer is yes, and it is already among us:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">non-invasive EEG</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to the remarkable amount of comments that even behind memes showed concern about implanting something inside the brain, there was also several posts about non-invasive EEG (electroencephalography), we talk about portable EEGs that are gaining more popularity every day in the market through headbands, headphones or tattooEEG.</p>



<p>Neuralink is a promising Neurotechnology with a great positive impact on society, but it seems that we are not ready for this yet, it will take time, perhaps more than 10 years to achieve massive consent to place intracranial chips. Meanwhile, the entire society is left with the desire to enhance brain capabilities with artificial intelligence and this is exactly where portable EEGs come into play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, companies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Interaxon</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emotiv.com/">Emotiv</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brainco.tech/">BrainCo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/">Naxon Labs</a>&nbsp;are showing that society is ready to use headbands and wearables that measure our brain activity, enhance cognition and help fight mental and neurological disorders.</p>



<p>Connected only with bluetooth, without implanting chips and with a horizon full of possibilities that range from improving the ability to study or work, detecting when a driver is falling asleep, detecting emotions or accelerating the treatment of many mental and neurological problems on a scale never seen before before.<a href="https://choosemuse.com/">Interaxon</a>&nbsp;for example, has created&nbsp;brainwave-controlled computing technology and applications that converts brainwaves into digital signals. They have an app that can be used with their hardware to train in mindfulness and meditation that can help you calm you down and reduce stress.</p>

<p><a href="https://naxonlabs.com/">Naxon Labs</a>&nbsp;on the other hand, provides software and data platforms that work with Interaxon’s&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/get_headband">Muse headset</a>&nbsp;to offer an accessible, simple and low-cost way to record brain activity and mental states of the person and work with this data to meet the needs of academic centers, clinics and professionals.

At the same time, the company is working on&nbsp;<a href="https://naxonlabs.com/products/emotions">Emotions</a>, a platform for emotion recognition which promise to detect states like anxiety, relaxation, concentration, joy, anger or sadness in real time. The system can be used by mental health professionals to improve patient records for diagnosis and treatment, enable monitoring of patient progress, remote monitoring and therapy, improve the implementation of techniques for regulating mental disorders, and also allowing applications in various specific disorders such as ADHD.</p>

<p>In this way and as a collateral effect, Neuralink opens the door to curiosity about portable EEGs and sows a path towards the future with a society that will no longer be shocked by moving objects with a simple thought.</p>

          <h2>Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka Without Downtime</h2>

          <p><span>Scaling backend infrastructure to handle hyper-growth is one of the many exciting challenges of working at DoorDash. In mid 2019, we faced significant scaling challenges and frequent outages involving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery_(software)"><span>Celery</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a><span>, two technologies powering the system that handles the asynchronous work enabling critical functionalities of our platform, including order checkout and Dasher assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We quickly solved this problem with a simple, </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"><span>Apache Kafka</span></a><span>-based asynchronous task processing system that stopped our outages while we continued to iterate on a robust solution. Our initial version implemented the smallest set of features needed to accommodate a large portion of existing Celery tasks. Once in production, we continued to add support for more Celery features while addressing novel problems that arose when using Kafka. </span></p>
<h2><span>The problems we faced using Celery and RabbitMQ</span></h2>
<p><span>RabbitMQ and Celery were mission critical pieces of our infrastructure that powered over 900 different asynchronous tasks at DoorDash, including order checkout, merchant order transmission, and Dasher location processing. The problem DoorDash faced was that RabbitMQ was frequently going down due to excessive load. If task processing went down, DoorDash effectively went down and orders could not be completed, resulting in revenue loss for our merchants and Dashers, and a poor experience for our consumers. We faced issues on the following fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability:</b><span> Outages caused by demand reduced availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b><span> RabbitMQ could not scale with the growth of our business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Observability:</b><span> RabbitMQ offered limited metrics and Celery workers were opaque.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Operational efficiency:</b><span> Restarting these components was a time-consuming, manual process.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Why our asynchronous task processing system wasn’t highly available</span></h3>
<p><span>This biggest problem we faced were outages, and they often came when demand was at its peak. RabbitMQ would go down due to load, </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn"><span>excessive connection churn</span></a><span>, and other reasons. Orders would be halted, and we’d have to restart our system or sometimes even bring up an entirely new broker and manually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"><span>failover</span></a><span> in order to recover from the outage.</span></p>
<p><span>On diving deeper into the availability issues, we found the following sub-issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Celery allows users to schedule tasks in the future with a countdown or ETA. Our heavy use of&nbsp; these countdowns resulted in noticeable load increases on the broker. Some of our outages were directly related to an increase in tasks with countdowns. We ultimately decided to restrict the use of countdowns in favor of another system we had in place for scheduling work in the future.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden bursts of traffic would leave RabbitMQ in a degraded state where task consumption was significantly lower than expected. In our experience, this could only be resolved with a RabbitMQ bounce. RabbitMQ has a concept of Flow Control where it will reduce the speed of connections which are publishing too quickly so that queues can keep up. Flow Control was often, but not always, involved in these availability degradations. When Flow Control kicks in, the publishers effectively see it as network latency. Network latency reduces our response times; if latency increases during peak traffic, significant slowdowns can result that cascade as requests pile up upstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Our python </span><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span>uWSGI</span></a><span> web workers had a feature called harakiri that was enabled to kill any processes that exceeded a timeout. During outages or slowdowns, harakiri resulted in a connection churn to the RabbitMQ brokers as processes were repeatedly killed and restarted. With thousands of web workers running at any given time, any slowness that triggered harakiri would in turn contribute even more to slowness by adding extra load to RabbitMQ.</span></li>
<li><span>In production we experienced several cases where task processing in the Celery consumers&nbsp; stopped, even in the absence of significant load. Our investigation efforts did not yield evidence of any resource constraints that would’ve halted processing, and the workers resumed processing once they were bounced. This problem was never root caused, though we suspect an issue in the Celery workers themselves and not RabbitMQ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, all of these availability issues were unacceptable for us as high reliability is one of our highest priorities. Since these outages were costing us a lot in terms of missed orders and credibility we needed a solution that would address these problems as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why our legacy solution did not scale&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The next biggest problem was scale. DoorDash is growing fast and we were quickly reaching the limits of our existing solution. We needed to find something that would keep up with our continued growth since our legacy solution had the following problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the vertical scaling limit</strong></p>
<p><span>We were using the largest available single-node RabbitMQ solution that was available to us. There was no path to scale vertically any further and we were already starting to push that node to its limits.</span></p>
<p><strong>The High Availability mode limited our capacity&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Due to replication, the primary-secondary High Availability (HA) mode reduced throughput compared to the single node option, leaving us with even less headroom than just the single node solution. We could not afford to trade throughput for availability.</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the primary-secondary HA mode did not, in practice, reduce the severity of our outages. Failovers took more than 20&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; to complete and would often get stuck requiring manual intervention. Messages were often lost in the process as well.</span></p>
<p><span>We were quickly running out of headroom as DoorDash continued to grow and push our task processing to its limits. We needed a solution that could scale horizontally as our processing needs grew.</span></p>
<h3><span>How Celery and RabbitMQ offered limited observability</span></h3>
<p><span>Knowing what’s going on in any system is fundamental to ensuring its availability, scalability, and operational integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we navigated the issues outlined above, we noticed that :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We were limited to a small set of RabbitMQ metrics available to us.</span></li>
<li><span>We had limited visibility into the Celery workers themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We needed to be able to see real-time metrics of every aspect of our system which meant the observability limitations needed to be addressed as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The operational efficiency challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>We also faced several issues with operating RabbitMQ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We often had to failover our RabbitMQ node to a new one to resolve the persistent degradation we observed. This operation was manual and time consuming for the engineers involved and often had to be done late at night, outside of peak times.</span></li>
<li><span>There were no in-house Celery or RabbitMQ experts at DoorDash who we could lean on to help devise a scaling strategy for this technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Engineering time spent operating and maintaining RabbitMQ was not sustainable. We needed something that better met our current and future needs.</span></p>
<h2><span>Potential solutions to our problems with Celery and RabbitMQ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With the problems outlined above, we considered the following solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Celery broker from RabbitMQ to Redis or Kafka. </b>This would allow us to continue using Celery, with a different and potentially more reliable backing datastore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Add multi-broker support to our </b><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a><b> app so consumers could publish to N different brokers based on whatever logic we wanted. </b>Task processing will get sharded across multiple brokers, so each broker will experience a fraction of the initial load.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade to newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ. </b>Newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ were expected to fix reliability issues, buying us time as we were already extracting components from our Django monolith in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate to a custom solution backed by Kafka. </b>This solution takes more effort than the other options we listed, but also has more potential to solve every problem we were having with the legacy solution.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Each option has its pros and cons:</span></p>

They were influenced by ideas coming out of the Enlightenment, specifically Adam Smith, Locke, Rousseau, and the conception of humans resorting to “the state of nature” and acting in bad-faith with one another.</p> <figure> <blockquote> <p> "fuck the monarchy, let's experiment with a rational government based on contract law and this new capitalism stuff." </p> </blockquote> <figcaption> —The Forefathers™, <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite> </figcaption> </figure> <p>The problem with this type of Hobbesian thinking is “man will resort to kill or be killed in the ‘state of nature’” and therefore the State must enforce contacts to ensure civility and protect the rights of property.</p> <p>My thinking is more aligned to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html">Zeynep Tufecki</a></p> <blockquote> <p>“We think of society as this Hobbesian thing, as opposed to the reality where most people are very friendly, most people are prone to solidarity.” <cite><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html">How Zeynep Tufekci Keeps Getting the Gig-things Right</a> </cite></p> </blockquote> <p>In disasters and daily life, people want to help each other, and feel as part of something greater than themselves. The atomization of the individual, a result of capitalism, continually undermines this fundamental aspect of the human experience.</p> <p>So when we’ve built our government on Hobbes as our fundamental philosophical ideology, we’ve ended up institutionalizing the idea that civil society is “every man for himself” rather than “every man for each other” and those institutions become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, we’ve expanded on the US experiment in capitalism by privileging corporations with more rights and freedoms than humans, but without the social or moral responsibilities. That can only end badly when their only motive is profit. Then we’ve built this enormous apparatus of violence in the US military, the national guard, a decentralized police force, and a word salad of agencies like the NSA, CIA, FBI, CBP, TSA, ATF, hell even the USPS has an armed force. All these agencies assume the average person is acting in bad-faith, and yet we wonder why these armed agents are killing people by the thousands and without accountability and most often with total immunity.</p> <p>This is all to say, the experiment in democratic Hobbesian capitalism should be cancelled. Its core assumption are all wrong: it assumed infinite resources on a finite planet which is wrong, it assumed the worst of people which is wrong, It absolved corporations of any ethics and granted them freedom and rights—which is wrong.</p> <p>The experiment is no longer producing the outcomes for which it once promised—based on the idea of the social contract established by Rousseau, which provides for social reciprocity: we chose the laws under which we live. This is less and less the case. We’re increasingly seeing wealth for the few and social precarity for the many, under a system of governance that responds to corporations before it responds to people.</p> <p>It’s time to try a new experiment in resource allocation and governance that is egalitarian, sustainable, and provides a vision where all inhabitants of this planet act in good faith towards a project for multiple worlds, and many positive futures. Other <em>worlds</em> are possible.</p> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered: “What if clicking on a hyperlink could transport me — not just the screen in front of me — to a new location?”</p><p>That’s what the founders of Uber wondered. So, they transformed an ordinary link into a request for a ride.</p><p>This is called “hacking hypertext”.</p><p>Imagine, a link—a button, a menu, a search result—being able to accomplish something in the real world with a single click.</p><p>Google is a great example of this. They hacked hypertext in two ways: 1) They realized a hyperlink to a page meant that page is more valuable and 2) They gave everyone access to the most valuable links with the click of a Search button.</p><p>Facebook took hyperlinks to the next level by making them represent people and their relationships. Events, messages, profile pages, relationship statuses — all available with a click.</p><p>Who else has hacked hypertext?</p><ul><li>Amazon has 1-Click ordering that makes products show up at your door</li><li>Airbnb lets you rent apartments around the world with a click</li><li>Netflix makes thousands of tv shows and movies accessible with a single click</li></ul><p>These companies transform the good ol’ hyperlink into something incredibly powerful. </p><p>For most of us, though, links are still just plain, boring links.</p><p>As an ordinary person on the internet, I can’t create a link out of thin air that will show a list of my upcoming events or let someone rent my apartment — I rely on Facebook and Airbnb to create these kinds of links. </p><p>So, the question is: <em>why isn’t hypertext more powerful by default?</em></p><p>The answer is: it’s wildly expensive to transform an ordinary hyperlink into something more.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars a year building the infrastructure and hiring the talent necessary to support their hypertext hacks.</p><p>Usually, the most an ordinary citizen of the internet can do is use a hyperlink to link to their social media profile or personal website.</p><p>But... what if someone decided to democratize the incredible power these big companies have to hack hypertext?</p><p>What if anyone could hack hypertext?</p><p>More and more companies are buying into the “Low-Code” movement. Companies like Stripe, Webflow, and Shopify are making it easier to create online businesses. And companies like Airtable, Bubble, and Glide are making it possible for ordinary people to build powerful experiences using a set of hypertext hacks they invented.</p><p>But the foundation is still lacking. Hypertext itself hasn’t changed that much in the past three decades. It’s still, by default, pretty weak. It’s meant to create links between pages, not links to real-world actions.</p><p>I believe there’s a stage after “Low-Code”, a kind of hypertext 2.0. Maybe it comes with virtual reality, or cryptocurrency — or maybe it’s born when someone creates a new type of web browser. I don’t know. But, when it comes, it’s going to let anyone have the power to reshape the real world with a good ol’ hyperlink.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>How does QuestDB get the kind of performance it does, and how are we continuing
to squeeze another 50-60% out of it? We are constantly learning more about the
fundamental concepts of memory performance, and this is one example of how what
we at first thought would be <em>worse</em> for performance ended up bringing us a
rather substantial boost in overall memory performance.</p><p>We will walk you through how some of our initial thoughts on storage and
memory-mapping evolved to bring us better performance overall.</p><p>If you like QuestDB, please do give us a star on
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p><h2>How the performance improvements started</h2><p>QuestDB started out with a single-threaded approach to queries and such. But one
obvious way to improve performance in a Java application like this is to
parallelize as much as you can by using multiple threads of execution.</p><p>I've written multi-threaded applications, and they are not easy to do. It's hard
to coordinate the work between multiple threads, and to make sure that there are
no race conditions, collisions, etc.</p><h2>Storage performance</h2><p>So first it's important to understand that QuestDB stores it's data in columnar
format. We store each column of data in a file. So for every column of data,
there is a file.</p><p>We then split those columns up into data frames that are independent and can be
computed completely independently of each other.</p><p>The problem we encountered with this framing scheme was that it was impossible
to frame variable length data. Data spilled out of the frame, making it
difficult to manage.</p><p>You see, we store fixed length fields with fixed length values, such that
aligning frames to 8 bytes would ensure that all our fixed length data does not
straddle frames. Hence all the columns are the same frame width. But strings and
blobs can't be forced into 8 bytes without making them useless.</p><p>So we could extract extreme performance out of all the fixed-length values, but
these variable-length values dragged the performance back down.</p><p>Which brings us to pages and how data is referenced in memory.</p><h2>Pages of data</h2><p>QuestDB uses memory-mapped pages to reference data in order to make it really
fast. If you're dividing up your data into pages, and all data has a fixed
length, then it's relatively easy to ensure that you don't have data that spans
multiple pages. You just break pages at multiples of 8-bytes and everything will
fit within page boundaries.</p><p>When you add variable-length data, suddenly you cannot ensure that everything
will line up along page boundaries and you will have the very real possibility
-- actually a certainty -- that you may have to jump from one page to another
just to get all the data contained in a frame.</p><p>This, it turns out, is hugely inefficient. If (data is in frame) then (process
that data) else (figure out where the rest of the data is, get that, then
process it all). This kind of if-then-else sprinkled throughout the code is a)
hard to debug and b) leads to lots of branching, which slows down execution.</p><p>In order to prevent variable length data from straddling frames we would need to
have different frame lengths per column. Furthermore, calculating aligned frame
lengths for variable length data is non trivial and requires scanning the entire
data set which would reversing any performance gains from parallelization.</p><h2>One page to rule them all</h2><p>(Yes, I just made a <em>The Highlander</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference</a>)</p><p>What if, in order to get around data being on multiple pages, we simply used
<em>one</em> page for all of the data? Of course my first question was "Don't you at
some point reach a limit on the page size?" but Vlad and Patrick assured me
there is, indeed, no limit on a page size.</p><p>If your page size is bigger than the available memory, the kernel will handle
swapping pages in and out for you as you try to access different parts of the
page. So of course I asked "well then, why didn't you do this from the
beginning?"</p><p>Vlad, in his typically self-deprecating style, just said "We didn't know. We
thought we should keep them to a certain size to keep them from growing out of
control" which, quite frankly, seems like the right answer.</p><p>We'd just resize those smaller pages as needed. But as Vlad explained, if you do
that then you need to copy the data over to the new, resized page and "copying
can take over your life." Databases aren't built to maximize the efficiency of
data copying. They are built to maximize the ability to extract value from data.
Copying data from one page to another isn't extracting value.</p><p>So they tried just allocating a new page, and jumping from one page to the next
as needed to find the required data. This cut down on the copying of data, but
it lead to the problems outlined in the previous section. You never knew which
page your data was going to be on, and jumping from one page to another was
hugely inefficient.</p><p>So they tried having just the one page. One massive page (that you can grow as
needed, without copying data around). Vlad, again in his style, said the
performance turned out to be "not bad" with this approach. And by "not bad" he
of course meant about a 60% performance improvement.</p><p>When you get into using one single page, of course the total available address
space comes into play. But since QuestDB only runs on 64-bit architectures, we
have 2^64 address space, which is more than enough.</p><p>This is where Patrick jumped in to explain that when you have an area of memory
mapped from a file, when the file grows you remap the new size into memory. The
operating system does not need to copy anything; the virtual memory model allows
the OS to just remap the already mapped pages into the newly mapped memory
region. In many cases, the OS may have already reserved the entire address space
for you so your new mapping is in the same region as the old, just bigger.</p><h2>Kernels are smart</h2><p>The kernel allocated a full sized address space for your file when you requested
the memory-mapped file. And apparently this is true across Linux, macOS and
Windows. So from that point on, there's really no further copying that needs to
happen.</p><p>Furthermore, the kernel is going to handle paging parts of that file in and out
of memory as needed. Now, I'm old-school Unix, and page-swapping which lead to
thrashing was always something we worried about back in the olden days. So I
asked about it. According to Patrick, this could only happen really if you have
a massive file that you are reading basically randomly at high speed. Other than
that, the kernel will handle reading ahead and pre-loading pages as needed in
order to be as efficient as possible.</p><p>Kernels, it turns out, are smart. In fact, kernels are basically smarter than
you or I will ever hope to be. They've been developed across decades to be
hugely efficient at doing these things. It's what they do. The kernel will
memory map the file into the file cache and even if it needs to move stuff
around, it can move the logical address and it's still the same underlying
physical memory pages.</p><p>If you think that you can take over caching the data from the OS and do a better
job of managing the memory space, and the allocation and re-allocation of the
memory, you're wrong. Again, this is what the Kernel does, and at some level,
even if you try to take this job away from the kernel, it is <em>still</em> doing some
amount of it anyway. So your attempts to take this memory management and
allocation away from the kernel has done little more than just add another layer
on top of what the kernel is doing anyway. Another layer on top of something is
basically never more efficient than the original thing.</p><p>When you read an offset into a file, you send a buffer to read into, the address
to start reading at, and the offset into the file. Now, the kernel is going to
cache all of that for you as you do it, because that's the kernel's job, really.
But many database developers then take that, and cache it themselves, with their
own caching scheme.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>When I asked Vlad about this, and how it relates to query speed, he was quite
explicit in saying that thinking you (a database developer) can beat the kernel
is pure folly. Postgres tries this and, according to Vlad, an aggregation over a
large (really large!) dataset can take 5 <em>minutes</em>, whereas the same aggregation
on QuestDB takes only 60ms. Those aren't typos.</p><p>To both Patrick and Vlad (and me, for what that's worth), the idea that we, as
developers, can be better at these operations than the kernel (when really we're
doing them <em>on top of</em> the kernel anyway) is simply ridiculous. If I take an
army of researchers and spend a decade of development, then <em>maybe</em> I can do it
better than the kernel, but during that time guess what? The army of people
working on the kernel will have found further improvements and left me behind
anyway.</p><p>It comes down to letting the kernel do its job, and us doing ours. And our job
is to exploit the kernel for every ounce of performance we can get out of it
without trying to do it's job for it.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>When it comes to performance claims, we always try to back them up with actual
numbers that can be replicated. You can run these tests yourself, and you can
always go and look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>
for these tests to see how they are implemented.</p><p>We think these numbers speak for themselves.</p><p>These first results are for the primitives and represent 10,000 reads/writes:</p><h3>32-bit Read</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryReadBenchmark.testIntContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4601.940</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryReadBenchmark.testIntLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>7064.822</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>32-Bit Write</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryBenchmark.testPutIntContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5270.264</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryBenchmark.testPutIntLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5692.148</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>64-bit Read</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongReadBenchmark.testLongContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4088.338</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongReadBenchmark.testLongLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>5022.875</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>64-bit Write</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>Mode</th><th>Cnt</th><th>Score</th><th>Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongWriteBenchmark.testPutLongContiguous</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>4413.181</td><td>ns/op</td></tr><tr><td>VirtualMemoryLongWriteBenchmark.testPutLongLegacy</td><td>avgt</td><td>5</td><td>6976.593</td><td>ns/op</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And here are the results for strings, which represent 100 …</p></section></div>

<![CDATA[You Don't Need Staging Environments]]>

September 4, 2020 | https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>
  Theoretically, staging environments sound nice. Why wouldn’t you want
  something that previews what the code will look like before production? The
  issue is what happens in practice.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a big ask. To show how much of a big ask it is let’s walk through an
  example. Say that there’s a developer named Bob. Bob works in a 7 person
  startup that is building a SaaS tool. Their stack has three parts: a static
  HTML frontend, a node backend, and a Postgres server.
</p>
<p>
  This week, one of Bob’s goals is to set up a staging environment to get those
  sweet sweet previews everyone’s been talking about. It looks simple enough,
  they’re already using serverless to deploy their frontend so the job is
  reduced down to hooking up some pipeline to deploy a version of the frontend
  for each new commit on a separate subdomain.
</p>
<h4>Issue 1: Version Incompatibilities With The Backend</h4>
<p>
  That works and he’s happy. Two weeks later though, there are some issues. The
  team is working on a major feature that’s been in development for the past few
  days on a separate branch. It includes both changes to the frontend and a new
  endpoint on the backend. So the staging environment crashes because it tries
  to talk to the backend while the backend doesn’t have the endpoint. The
  solution? Give the staging environment its backend. Bob wrangles the pipeline
  a bit to deploy a backend and a frontend for each change. After a few days of
  work, it’s done and he’s happy.
</p>
<h4>Issue 2: Handing Database Schema Changes</h4>
<p>
  Three weeks later, there's an issue again. Now the team is working on a
  feature that includes a schema change on the database. They can’t use the
  staging environment because the server crashes due to incompatibility with the
  database. The solution seems clear. Bring the database into the staging
  environment. He wrangles the pipeline to spin up a new DB for each commit and
  run migration scripts on startup every time. Now the staging environment is a
  complete miniature copy of what’s happening in production. There shouldn’t be
  any more issues going forward. Right?
</p>
<h4>Issue 3: Maintaining The Codebase For Different Target Environments</h4>
<p>
  Wrong. Bob notices something unexpected. The team is using staging
  environments less than before. Turns out it's a hassle to have to create a new
  user account and generate content every time they want to test things on the
  staging environment. They started seeding the staging database on startup, but
  then realized they now have to maintain code to seed the database for each
  table inside it, and that’s a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>As the staging environment grew more complicated, it became less easy to
    work with.</b>
  In the future, the backend might need another service to function like a Redis
  instance or a new microservice. That’s gonna have to go into the staging
  environment too. Maybe Bob should have stopped at just the frontend and kept
  the staging environment hooked up to the production backend.
</p>
<p>
  But then the team risks incompatibility issues when the staging frontend
  expects a different version of the production backend it’s talking to. At
  best, the frontend will throw errors occasionally, at
  <b> worst it will silently leave corrupted data on the database</b>.
</p>
<h4>Staging Isn't Easy</h4>
<p>
  If your team doesn't have the bandwidth or the resources to build a pipeline
  that can spin up entire miniature copies of the production environment,
  <b>staging isn't for you</b>. The biggest draw for staging environments is to
  visually inspect changes to the frontend. The backend parts of the codebase
  can often be more conveniently verified through testing.
</p>
<p>
  For previewing frontends, we built Capsule for developers like Bob’s team. You
  can use the extension to make HTML recordings of the frontend. Just by linking
  to your capsule in the PRs, you'd be able to do the same thing a staging
  environment can do with none of the work of maintaining a staging environment
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Say that I was part of the google calendar team, and wanted to share my local
  changes. I click on the extension, and boom:
</p>

<p>
  I have a shareable link to my changes. No maintance; no deployment pipelines
  needed.
</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<h3>Learn how to implement an automated machine learning strategy with the goal of finding the optimal stocks for algorithmic trading.</h3>



<hr>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*Qin1Uu6TF6EGY9Qe" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stephenleo1982?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Leonardi</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="761b">With the increasing popularity of machine learning, many traders are looking for ways in which they can “teach” a computer to trade for them. This process is called algorithmic trading (sometimes called algo-trading).</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Algorithmic trading is a hands off strategy for buying and selling stocks that leverages technical indicators instead of human intuition.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p id="8e73">In order to implement an algorithmic trading strategy though, you have to first narrow down a list of stocks that you want to analyze. This walk-through provides an automated process (using python and logistic regression) for determining the best stocks to algo-trade.</p>



<p id="45b0">I will dive deeper into the logic and code below, but here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>



<ol><li>Import the historical data of every stock using yahoo finance.</li><li>Pull in over 32 technical indicators for each stock using the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</li><li>Perform a logistic regression on each stock using 5, 30, and 60 day observation time periods.</li><li>Interpret the results.</li></ol>

<h2 id="8a50">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="b37a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process.</p>



<ol><li>Narrow down a list of stocks that we want to observe.</li><li>Make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</li></ol>



<p id="d925"><strong>Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</strong></p>



<p id="b1b8">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of stock tickers by filtering companies on aspects like market cap or exchange. For this example, I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions).</p>



<p id="b0b7">You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<p id="a75a">We also need to remove and create a folder on our local machine to hold historical stock data. Note that before this step runs for the first time, you will need to manually create this folder. This step is important because it will get rid of the data from past iterations and allow the program to start new.</p>



<div><pre data-file="https://gist.github.com/cameronShadmehry/7fd146a70470186482eadefde6dec7ea#file-atlr_gettickers-py" data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44.
# If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)

# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 2000
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))

# These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks. Make sure you have created a Stocks Folder the first time you run this.

<h2 id="c45e">Importing Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="1c9d">We will now obtain the historical price data of each stock in our tickers list by making independent calls to Yahoo Finance. After receiving the data, the program will save each company’s information in a new CSV file that will be located in the folder you created beforehand.</p>

Amount_of_API_Calls = 0

# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2
# seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again.
# Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making
# too many calls to the yfinance API.

        Hist_data.to_csv("&lt;Your Path&gt;\\Bayesian_Logistic_Regression\\Stocks\\"+stock+".csv")  # Saves the historical data in csv format for further processing later

<h2 id="2687">Importing Technical Indicators</h2>



<p id="a921">In order to run a logistic regression on each stock, we need to substantiate the independent variables. These 32+ technical indicators will act as predictor variables for the dependent variable.</p>



<p id="6e7c">To bring in the technical indicators we make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</p>



<p id="1d04">You will also notice that we are creating three extra columns. These will act as the value we are trying to predict (dependent variable) with the model. The three variables are 5, 30, and 60 day observations of the closing prices of each stock (1 if it increased and 0 if it did not).</p>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>
<p>Bis dahin wollen wir Ideen sammeln, wie wir zusammen die rC3 gestalten wollen.<br>
Was erwarten wir von einer Remote-Veranstaltung?<br>
Welche neuen Formate, Spiele und Easter-Eggs sind möglich?<br>
Was können wir beitragen?<br>
Und welche Fehler sollten die C3-Teams beim Planen vermeiden?</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jedes Input unter<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>Wann ist das nochmal?</h2>
<p>Save the date:<br>
27. – 30. Dezember 2020<br>
Online und im lokalen Hackspace mit deiner bevorzugten Infektionsgemeinschaft</p>
<hr>
<p>[English Version]<a name="english"></a></p>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>

<p>This summer, I am again <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/11/research-assistant.html">working on Rust full-time</a>, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR.
However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”.
Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.</p>

<p>I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what <em>is</em> the data that is stored in memory?
It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte?
Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)</p>

<h2 id="pointers-are-complicated">Pointers Are Complicated</h2>

<p>What is the problem with “pointers are just integers”?  Let us consider the following example:<br>
(I am using C++ code here mostly because writing unsafe code is easier in C++ than in Rust, and unsafe code is where these problems really show up. C has all the same issues, as does unsafe Rust.)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>/* some side-effect-free computation */</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It would be beneficial to be able to optimize the final read of <code>y[0]</code> to just return <code>42</code>.
The justification for this optimization is that writing to <code>x_ptr</code>, which points into <code>x</code>, cannot change <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>However, given how low-level a language C++ is, we can actually break this assumption by setting <code>i</code> to <code>y-x</code>.
Since <code>&amp;x[i]</code> is the same as <code>x+i</code>, this means we are actually writing <code>23</code> to <code>&amp;y[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, that does not stop C++ compilers from doing these optimizations.
To allow this, the standard declares our code to have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/14/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not allowed to perform pointer arithmetic (like <code>&amp;x[i]</code> does) that goes <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">beyond either end of the array it started in</a>.
Our program violates this rule: <code>x[i]</code> is outside of <code>x</code>, so this is undefined behavior.
To be clear: Just the <em>computation</em> of <code>x_ptr</code> is already UB, we don’t even get to the part where we want to <em>use</em> this pointer!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But we are not done yet: This rule has a special exception that we can exploit to our advantage.
If the arithmetic ends up computing a pointer <em>just past</em> the end of an allocation, that computation is fine.
(This exception is necessary to permit computing <code>vec.end()</code> for the usual kind of C++98 iterator loop.)</p>

<p>So let us change this example a bit:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>+</span><span>8</span><span>;</span> <span>// one past the end</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>==</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
      <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, imagine that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have been allocated <em>right next to each other</em>, with <code>y</code> having the higher address.
Then <code>x_ptr</code> actually points <em>right at the beginning</em> of <code>y</code>!
The conditional is true and the write happens.
Still, there is no UB due to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>This seems to break the optimization.
However, the C++ standard has another trick up its sleeve to help compiler writers: It doesn’t actually allow us to <em>use</em> our <code>x_ptr</code> above.
According to what the standard says about <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">addition on pointers</a>, <code>x_ptr</code> points “one past the last element of the array object”.
It does <em>not</em> point at an actual element of another object <em>even if they have the same address</em>. (At least, that is the common interpretation of the standard based on which <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/vxmtej">LLVM optimizes this code</a>.)</p>

<p>The key point here is that just because <code>x_ptr</code> and <code>&amp;y[0]</code> point to the same <em>address</em>, that does not make them <em>the same pointer</em>, i.e., they cannot be used interchangeably:
<code>&amp;y[0]</code> points to the first element of <code>y</code>; <code>x_ptr</code> points past the end of <code>x</code>.
If we replace <code>*x_ptr = 23</code> by <code>*&amp;y[0] = 0</code>, we change the meaning of the program, even though the two pointers have been tested for equality.</p>

<p>This is worth repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal and can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds subtle, it is.
In fact, this still causes miscompilations in both <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752">GCC</a>.</p>

<p>Also notice that this one-past-the-end rule is not the only part of C/C++ where this effect can be witnessed.
Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict"><code>restrict</code></a> keyword in C, which can be used to express that pointers do not alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Calling <code>test()</code> triggers UB because the two accesses in <code>foo</code> must not alias.
Replacing <code>*y</code> by <code>*x</code> in <code>foo</code> changes the meaning of the program such that it no longer has UB.
So, again, even though <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the same address, they cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Pointers are definitely not integers.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-pointer-model">A Simple Pointer Model</h2>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> a pointer?
I don’t know the full answer to this.
In fact, this is an open area of research.</p>

<p>One important point to stress here is that we are just looking for an <em>abstract model</em> of the pointer.
Of course, on the actual machine, pointers are integers.
But the actual machine also does not do the kind of optimizations that modern C++ compilers do, so it can get away with that.
If we wrote the above programs in assembly, there would be no UB, and no optimizations.
C++ and Rust employ a more “high-level” view of memory and pointers, restricting the programmer for the benefit of optimizations.
When formally describing what the programmer may and may not do in these languages, as we have seen, the model of pointers as integers falls apart, so we have to look for something else.
This is another example of using a “virtual machine” that’s different from the real machine for specification purposes, which is an idea <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html">I have blogged about before</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple proposal (in fact, this is the model of pointers used in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00703441/document">CompCert</a> and my <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/08/rustbelt.html">RustBelt work</a>, and it is also how <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">miri</a> implements <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fefe81605d6111faa8dbb3635ab2c51d59de740a/src/librustc/mir/interpret/mod.rs#L121-L124">pointers</a>):
A pointer is a pair of some kind of ID uniquely identifying the <em>allocation</em>, and an <em>offset</em> into the allocation.
If we defined this in Rust, we might write</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>alloc_id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>isize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding/subtracting an integer to/from a pointer just acts on the offset, and can thus never leave the allocation.
Subtracting a pointer from another is only allowed when both point to the same allocation (matching <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#6">C++</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It turns out (and miri shows) that this model can get us very far.
We always remember which allocation a pointer points to, so we can differentiate a pointer “one past the end” of one allocation from a pointer to the beginning of another allocation.
That’s how miri can detect that our second example (with <code>&amp;x[8]</code>) is UB.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-falls-apart">The Model Falls Apart</h2>

<p>In this model, pointers are not integers, but they are at least simple.
However, this simple model starts to fall apart once you consider pointer-integer casts.
In miri, casting a pointer to an integer does not actually do anything, we now just have an integer variable (i.e., its <em>type</em> says it is an integer) whose <em>value</em> is a pointer (i.e., an allocation-offset pair).
However, multiplying that “integer” by 2 leads to an error, because it is entirely unclear what it means to multiply such an abstract pointer by 2.</p>

<p>I should clarify that this is <em>not</em> a good solution when defining language semantics.
It works fine for an interpreter though.
It is the most lazy thing to do, and we do it because it is not clear what else to do (other than not supporting these casts at all – but this way, miri can run more programs):
In our abstract machine, there just is no single coherent “address space” that all allocations live in, that we could use to map every pointer to a distinct integer.
Every allocation is just identified by an (unobservable) ID.
We could now start to enrich this model with extra data like a base address for each allocation, and somehow use that when casting an integer back to a pointer… but that’s where it gets really complicated, and anyway discussing such a model is not the point of this post.
The point it to discuss the <em>need</em> for such a model.
If you are interested, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Estevez/papers/KHM+15.pdf">this paper</a> that explores the above idea of adding a base address.</p>

<p>Long story short, pointer-integer casts are messy and hard to define formally when also considering optimizations like we discussed above.
There is a conflict between the high-level view that is required to enable optimizations, and the low-level view that is required to explain casting a pointer to an integer and back.
We mostly just ignore the problem in miri and opportunistically do as much as we can, given the simple model we are working with.
A full definition of a language like C++ or Rust of course cannot take this shortcut, it has to explain what really happens here.
To my knowledge, no satisfying solution exists, but academic research is <a href="http://sf.snu.ac.kr/publications/llvmtwin.pdf">getting closer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This was by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of academic research on C in general. I do not know of other work that focuses directly on the interplay of integer-pointer casts and optimizations, but other noteworthy work on formalizing C includes <a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">KCC</a>, <a href="https://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html">Robbert Krebber’s PhD thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">Cerberus</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<p>This is why pointers are not simple, either.</p>

<h2 id="from-pointers-to-bytes">From Pointers to Bytes</h2>

<p>I hope I made a convincing argument that integers are not the only data one has to consider when formally specifying low-level languages such as C++ or (the unsafe parts of) Rust.
However, this means that a simple operation like loading a byte from memory cannot just return a <code>u8</code>.
Imagine we <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/rlibc/blob/defb486e765846417a8e73329e8c5196f1dca49a/src/lib.rs#L39">implement <code>memcpy</code></a> by loading (in turn) every byte of the source into some local variable <code>v</code>, and then storing it to the target.
What if that byte is part of a pointer?  When a pointer is a pair of allocation and offset, what is its first byte?
We have to …</p></article></div>

                    <p>WireGuard is pretty great!</p><p>You might have noticed the buzz around <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> lately.
WireGuard is a very simple VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, and the buzz comes from both the fact that it’s simple and good at what it does, and the fact that it’s so good that it’s going to be included in the Linux kernel by default.
Linus Torvalds himself said that <a href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2018/08/02/124">he loves it</a>, which took the software world by storm, as we weren’t aware that Linus was capable of love or any emotion other than perkele.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve found with WireGuard is a lack of documentation, or rather a lack of documentation where you expect it.
The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">quickstart</a> guide, the first thing I look at, mentions a configuration file that it never tells you how to write, and it also assumes you’re more familiar with networking than I am.</p>
<p>Since the initial conditions at the creation of the universe set things up so WireGuard would eventually be underdocumented, I am going against Creation itself and showing you how to easily configure and run it.
Let’s <!-- break -->begin!</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/guard-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>A guard that looks kinda wiry, and makes sure you don't subconsciously find this post dry and boring.</span></p></div><p>At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that.
It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.</p>
<p>To do anything other than that, you’ll need to configure your network for it, which is “out of scope” for the WireGuard docs, but which I consider very much in the scope of a VPN.
Luckily, WireGuard comes with a helper script, <code>wg-quick</code>, which will do pretty much everything the average user needs.
Keep in mind that the configuration files for <code>wg-quick</code> aren’t compatible with the <code>wg</code> executable, but <code>wg-quick</code> is all we’ll need, so that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Let’s start setting everything up.</p>
<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>To install WireGuard, see <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">the installation</a> page, it should be a pretty simple process.
After you’ve installed it, you will need to generate a private and a public key for each computer you want accessing the VPN.
Due to WireGuard’s design, both computers on either end of a connection will need to have each other’s public key.</p>
<p>Let’s generate these keys. On each of the computers that will be in the VPN, create the directory <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and run these commands <em>on each of the computers</em> in the directory you just created:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ <span>umask</span> <span>077</span>  <span># This makes sure credentials don't leak in a race condition.</span>
$ wg genkey <span>|</span> tee privatekey <span>|</span> wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</pre></div>
<p>This will generate two files, <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> on each of the computers.
The <code>publickey</code> file is for telling the world, the <code>privatekey</code> file is secret and should stay on the computer it was generated on.
You need to paste the contents of these files in the config file, I’m afraid WireGuard doesn’t support referencing them by path yet.</p>
<p>If your VPN server is behind a NAT, you’ll also need to open a UDP port of your choosing (<code>51820</code> by default).
Do this for any computer you want to connect <em>to</em> (computers that you’ll connect <em>from</em> don’t need a port open, as far as I know, but correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<h2>Common scenarios</h2>
<p>After you’ve done the above, you’re ready to configure WireGuard.
Go to <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and create a file called <code>wg0.conf</code> on each of your computers.
We’ll go over some common scenarions along with the configuration for each.</p>
<h3>Just a single connection</h3>
<p>If you just want a single connection between two computers (say, to connect your laptop to your home server), the configuration is pretty simple.
On the server, enter the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.1</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>51820</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2/32</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That’s all you need for the server.
Keep in mind that <code>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</code> is your home server’s <code>privatekey</code> file’s contents (<strong>not</strong> the path to the file, the actual <strong>contents</strong>, a long line of gibberish), and <code>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</code> is similarly the contents of your laptop’s <code>publickey</code> file.</p>
<p>For the client, here’s the configuration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>

<span># This is for if you're behind a NAT and</span>
<span># want the connection to be kept alive.</span>
<span>PersistentKeepalive</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, replace the keys with the appropriate strings you generated.</p>
<p>As you can see, the addresses I picked for each computer are <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.2.2</code>, because that subnet was free in my setup.
If there’s an interface with that subnet on either computer, you should pick another one, such as <code>192.168.3.x</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>After writing the two files, run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> on the server and then on the client.
The two machines should now be connected if you entered the server’s IP in the config and configured the port correctly, and you should be able to <code>ping 192.168.2.1</code> from the VPN client and see the responses.
To close the connection again, just run <code>wg-quick down wg0</code>.</p>
<p>I repeat that <em>this setup only lets you access the server’s interface from the client</em>, it won’t forward any of your traffic over the server or let you access any other machines on the server’s LAN.</p>
<h3>Accessing your home LAN</h3>
<p>To actually access the server’s LAN, you’ll need to make a slight modification to the configuration.
On the server’s config file, at the end of the the <code>[Interface]</code> section, add these two lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PostUp</span>   <span>=</span> <span>iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
<span>PostDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that your LAN interface is called <code>eth0</code>.
If it isn’t, change the lines above to the actual name.</p>
<p>On the client, add your LAN’s subnet under <code>AllowedIPs</code>.
For example, if your subnet is <code>192.168.1.x</code>, change <code>AllowedIPs</code> to look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Briefly, the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting acts as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing">a routing table when sending, and an ACL when receiving</a>.
When a peer tries to send a packet to an IP, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code>, and if the IP appears in the list, it will send it through the WireGuard interface.
When it receives a packet over the interface, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code> again, and if the packet’s source address is not in the list, it will be dropped.</p>
<p>You might need to enable IP forwarding on the server for this to work, but it’s a simple process for Linux. <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/">Here’s a good guide</a>. If you’re running an OS X or Windows server, you don’t deserve nice things.</p>
<p>Then run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> as above, and you should be able to ping the other computers in the LAN from the client, as if you were home.
Try <code>ping 192.168.1.1</code> or any other computer in your LAN to verify.</p>
<p>Do note that <em>this won’t forward any other traffic</em> through your server, so it won’t proxy your web browsing or anything like that.
It will just let you talk to other machines on your server’s LAN.</p>
<p>For traffic forwarding, see below:</p>
<h3>Forwarding all your traffic through</h3>
<p>If you want to forward <em>all</em> your traffic through the VPN, WireGuard can easily do that as well.
Keep in mind that, if you’re doing this to avoid ISP tracking, it won’t work against your server’s ISP.
All your traffic will just look like it’s coming from your server, but if that’s at your house, all your torrents and porn downloading is just going to look like it’s coming from there, even though you’re at a net cafe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>To forward all the traffic through, simply change the <code>AllowedIPs</code> line on the client to this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here’s the entire client config again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>wg0</code> interface responsible for routing all IP addresses (hence the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), and should route all your traffic over your server.
You can check by loading one of the <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">what is my IP</a> websites and seeing that your server’s IP is what’s detected.</p>
<h2>Securing and running on startup</h2>
<p>After you’re done, run the following to make the directory and files readable only by administrators (it <em>does</em> contain secret keys, after all):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/wireguard/
$ sudo chmod -R og-rwx /etc/wireguard/*
</pre></div>
<p>After you’ve created and secured the file, you can easily set WireGuard to initialize the VPN on startup if your OS is using <code>systemd</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl <span>enable</span> wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to start or stop the service:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I hope this has been useful!
It’s the guide I wish existed before I spent three hours trying to configure WireGuard, and hopefully you can just copy the configs and have it work right away.</p>
<p>If you need the configuration for IPv6, I’m afraid you’re going to have to experiment yourself, as my ISP does not support it, but feel free to let me know what should be added and I can amend the article.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Stavros">tweet</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.host/@stavros">toot</a> any comments to me, or leave a comment below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<span>[<a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a>]</span>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre>char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&amp;sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<span>[<a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a>]</span>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function—and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<span>[<a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a>]</span> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and …</p></div></div>

You can't even appreciate animal onesies?</figcaption></figure><p>The reason to write about this Twitter drama is pretty simple: Culture matters. As I've pointed out before, that's why <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/multiplayer-psychosis/">everyone gets so worked up</a>. It would be ludicrous to claim that conceptions of <em>coolness</em> don't have real-world effects; I can attest that my own street cred has been hugely advantageous, and I am by no means a big deal.</p><p>If we want to <a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/">build the awesome future directly</a>, we need to point out who is a pernicious influence, who focuses on tearing others down rather than building them up — <em>especially</em> if they amass clout by doing so, then use it to initiate a negativity flywheel. Personally I can excuse moderate and occasional bitchiness (including from myself), but not the devoted focus of @VCBrags.</p><p>And yes, there should be reputational consequences for this behavior. Nobody needs to be fired, I'm not advocating for that, but bad-faith critics of the tech industry and those who work in it should be identified and ignored. After all, we genuinely do want to grow and improve! Meekly accepting malice, versus insisting on constructive feedback, undermines that effort.</p><p>So let's talk about Pasquale, this story's <em>enfant terrible</em>. It may be a tad confusing if you didn't see the saga unfold on Twitter — I won't recap every detail, but you can get up to speed here:</p><figure><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/09/01/the-enduring-mystery-around-an-anonymous-twitter-account-that-infuriated-techs-kingpins-and-nearly-ruined-a-founders-reputation/#4879f4d8548d"><div><p>The Enduring Mystery Around An Anonymous Twitter Account That Infuriated Tech’s Kingpins—And Nearly Ruined A Founder’s Reputation</p><p>By lampooning venture capitalists, @VCBrags accumulated an audience that included billionaires Jack Dorsey and Mark Cuban—and enmity from many of the people it skewered.</p><p><img src="https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png"><span>Abram Brown</span><span>Forbes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat(jpg)/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f4dbdc61f01affb0ae14e3e%2F0x0.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>That post is <em>mostly</em> accurate. Intriguingly, however, Forbes editor Abram Brown reported that Gumroad CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1298122211656523776">Sahil Lavingia</a> "still maintains he does know @VCBrags' true identity but declined to comment further and did not fully reveal his suspicions in his Twitter post." I gotta wonder how thoroughly Brown conducted his research:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1174w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Sahil Lavingia Retweeted" — I followed along for 🍿 reasons and a full-time Forbes journalist missed what I noticed.

					<h2>Hypothesis testing, beyond the dumb exercises</h2>
					<p>August 07, 2020</p>
				</header>
				<p>Statistics is hard and generally counter-intuitive; these notes regard one of the most interesting tools it can provide, hypothesis testing.</p>

<h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis testing</h2>

<p>Whenever a researcher attempts a certain claim based on data, some statistics is involved.
Hypothesis testing is a theoretical framework for dealing with claims and assign them a certain reliability.
Meaning that we not only want to know if data supports a claim but also with which degree of probability.
Hypothesis testing is used for answering questions like: <em>is this new medicine really effective curing a certain disease?</em>, <em>is the new high-speed mass transport reducing commuting time?</em></p>

<p>In this context the claim is called the <em>hypothesis</em> and it is paired (for convenience) with its counterpart, the <em>null hypothesis</em> which simply negates it.</p>

<p>We are playing with the following (boring) toy example:</p>

<p>In the USA, elementary students are found with an average QI of 100.
The principal of the Springfield elementary school, Skinner, makes 30 students of his undertake a test and he finds out they have an average QI of 112.5 (with a standard deviation of 15).</p>

<p>Immediately, he calls the superintendent Chalmers to request more funds for his gifted pupils.
But is his claim statistically correct?</p>

<h2 id="z-test">Z-test</h2>

<p>Z-test is one of the hypothesis testing available tests and it is applicable when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Samples are IID (Independently, identically distributed);</li>
  <li>The number of samples is large (greater than 30) or the standard deviation  is known.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, Skinner collected  samples with average  which we consider IID.
Since , we do not care if  is the true standard deviation or a sample one (for  we should apply the T-test if  is a sample standard deviation).</p>

<p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that:</p>

<p><em>For  large enough, the random variable  is distributed like a Gaussian </em></p>



<p>Here,  represents the mean of the distribution generating the samples.
Being the normal distribution symmetric, it naturally follows:</p>



<p>which is more straightforward for our purposes (because we are ultimately interested in the random variable ).</p>

<p>Note that the CLT works no matter what distribution generated the samples; <strong>the sample average will be always distributed as a Gaussian</strong>.</p>

<p>In our example, Skinner is trying to prove that the mean  for QI in Springfield school is not the same as the one for the rest of young kids in the USA.
His hypothesis is thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H1: </li>
</ul>

<p>while, Chalmers (and the hypothesis testing framework) are evaluating the opposite hypothesis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H0: </li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, this framework accepts the initial hypothesis by rejecting the <em>null</em> hypothesis (a version of <em>Reductio ad absurdum</em>).</p>

<p>Namely, it is now Chalmers’ job to prove Skinner wrong (and negate further funding).
Chalmers picks a certain level of confidence, and claims that he will discard H0 only if it has a probability below .</p>

<p>From the CLT equation we obtain that:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\mu \sim N(\bar{X},\frac{\sigma^2}{n})
\label{eq:mudist}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{\mu-\bar{X}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim N(0, 1)
\label{eq:zdist}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The first equation gives the probability distribution function for , based on the observed sample data.
The latter is the <em>Z</em> that gives the name to the test and represents the standardization of  wrt the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.</p>

<p>The following analysis and test is independent either we work on the  or the  random variable.
I think the former is more intuitive and the latter a residual of pre-computer era where people used to search in precomputed tables the values needed instead of interacting with a computer.
I present both approaches as the Z test is now widely accepted and discussed.</p>

<h3 id="mu-statistic"> statistic</h3>

<p>Back to our example, Skinner’s claim is that  is larger than 100 and its probability of being less than 100 is negligible.
Chalmers defines this negligibility as 5% of probability.</p>

<p>We call <em>-value</em> the probability under H0 to have observed our sample.
It represents the likelihood of the sample under H0.
In our example, the -value is the probability of having  for our sampled data.</p>

<p>The following image presents the distribution of  (the blue line) given our sample data, its average  and the cut at 100, the real average according to H0.
The -value is given by the area underlying the blue curve from  to .</p>

<p><img src="http://baldesi.ovh/images/2020-08-07_springfield_qi.png" alt="data frequencies"></p>

<p>Computing the probability -value  is hence trivial as computing the cumulative distribution function of the first equation, in Python</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy.stats as stats
&gt;&gt;&gt; stats.norm(112.5, 2.7386).cdf(100)
2.505e-06
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since -value  we can reject H0 and declare that H1 holds with a confidence of 95% (and possibly higher, till 1--value).
Skinner rejoices!</p>

<h3 id="z-statistic">Z statistic</h3>

<p>A more common way to proceed (but equivalent) with this test is using the Z statistic (the standardization of ).
We first compute  as Z under the H0 hypothesis:</p>



<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (100-112.5)*math.sqrt(30)/15
-4.564354645876384
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The image below presents this time the distribution of  (i.e., the distribution of the sample average given the observed sample data after standardization) which is nothing but the normal distribution with mean  and variance , and the cut point which this time is not directly , but its standardization, .</p>

<p><img src="http://baldesi.ovh/images/2020-08-07_springfield_qi_std.png" alt="data frequencies"></p>

<p>Given  and the  distribution function we now hence compute the probability  which is the area underlying the blue curve in the above image from  to .</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt; stats.norm(0,1).cdf(-4.56)
2.5051659781952214e-06
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, -value .
Again, since -value is less than  we reject H0 in favor of H1.</p>

<h2 id="t-test">T-test</h2>

<p>The T-test has been developed to address the limitation of the Z-test regarding the sample size.
It still requires the samples to be IID but it can be safely used whatever value of  we have.</p>

<p>Everything works as in the case of the Z-test, but we focus on the  statistic instead of the  one:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
T = \frac{\mu-\bar{X}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \sim T(n-1)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>In fact,  is still the distribution of the sample average given the observed sample data after standardization, but we know that for sample variance with  it does not distribute anymore like a normal distribution but, instead, like a student distribution (which is also symmetric and bell-shaped).</p>

<p>Here,  indicates the sample standard deviation and  represents the t-student distribution function with  degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Again, we can compute the cutting value:</p>



<p>Again, as in the latter case of the Z-test, we compute the p-value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; stats.t(29).cdf(-4.56)
4.3005975438384246e-05
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The interested reader might appreciate that for  the t-student and Gaussian distributions converge and  has been selected as the threshold at which the two distribution are not significantly different anymore. Hence, we can use the normal distribution and the Z-test with sample variance when ).
Which yields to the same comparison, -value </p>

<p>Hence, Chalmers has to surrender and recognize Springfield kids result more clever than the average USA student.
From here to invest more funding in their education, though, it is all another story.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantum entanglement has attracted some attention from the public that this mysterious process might be useful for lots of future applications, such as quantum computing and teleportation.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss quantum entanglement superficially using mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</h3>

<p>Assume we have two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$, represented respectively by the vector spaces $\mathbb{V}$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime}$. The quantum system obtained by merging $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ will have the tensor product $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime}$ as a state space.</p>



<p>If $\mathbb{V} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ with basic states $| x_0 \rangle, | x_1 \rangle, \cdots, | x_{n-1} \rangle$ and $\mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^m$ with basic states $| y_0 \rangle, | y_1 \rangle, \cdots, | y_{m-1} \rangle$, the tensor product state space would be $\mathbb{V} \otimes \mathbb{V}^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m}$ with basic states $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq j \leq m-1$. Here, the basic state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ means the first quantum systems $Q$ is in the state $| x_i \rangle$ and the second quantum system $Q^{\prime}$ is in the state $| y_j \rangle$.</p>



<p>More independent quantum systems $Q_0, Q_1, \cdots, Q_{k-1}$ could be merged together and the state space of the merged quantum system would be $\mathbb{V}_0 \otimes \mathbb{V}_1 \otimes \cdots\ \otimes \mathbb{V}_{k-1}$.</p>



<p>The system state of the merged quantum system from two independent quantum systems $Q$ and $Q^{\prime}$ could be expressed using basic states.</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{i,j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle\]

</p><p>The probability of the system being in the state $| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle$ after measurement, according to quantum mechanics, would be</p><p>

\[P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = \frac{|c_{i,j}|^2}{\sum_{s=0}^{n-1} \sum_{t=0}^{m-1} |c_{s,t}|^2 }\]

</p><p>If $c_{i,j} = 0$, then $P(| x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle) = 0$</p>



<p>We further consider the merged system whose $n = 2$ and $m = 2$.</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = c_{0,0} | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle + c_{0,1} | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle + c_{1,0} | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle + c_{1,1} | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle\]

</p><p>Suppose $c_{0,0} = 0$, $c_{0,1} = 1$, $c_{1,0} = 1$, $c_{1,1} = 0$, i.e.,</p><p>

\[| \psi \rangle = | x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle + | x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle\]

</p><p>When we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| x_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle$. Similarly, when we measure the state of the first quantum system $Q^{\prime}$, there are two possible outcomes, either the system was in the state $| y_0 \rangle$ or $| y_1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>If we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_0 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_1 \rangle$ even without measurement. Similarly, if we saw the system state of $Q$ is $| x_1 \rangle$, the system state of $Q^{\prime}$ must be $| y_0 \rangle$ even without measurement. This is because the probability of observing $| x_0 \rangle \otimes | y_0 \rangle$ or $| x_1 \rangle \otimes | y_1 \rangle$ is 0.</p>



<p>This is called quantum entanglement.</p>



<p>In this case, no matter how far the two subsystems in the entangled system is, we know the system states of both subsystems by just observing one single subsystem.</p>



<p>The quantum entanglement is simultaneous and instantaneous. If we describe this process using “velocity”, we would find the “velocity” is infinitely large, faster than light speed, which is the fastest “velocity” we are currently using for information transmission. However, we prefer not to describe this process using velocity, since it is not a conventional physical “travel” process.</p>



<p>Formally, if a merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ can be broken into the tensor product of states from the constituent subsystems, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{i,j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle \\
&amp;= \Big(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_{x, i} | x_i \rangle \Big) \otimes \Big(\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{y, j} | y_j \rangle \Big) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} c_{x, i} c_{y, j} | x_i \rangle \otimes | y_j \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We call this merged system state $| \psi \rangle$ separable state. Otherwise we call it entangled state, as we would find there is no solution to solve the above equation for an entangled state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>Some people who did not study physics sometimes described the process of quantum entanglement as if there is a causation relationship, which means that it is the state of one subsystem affecting the other subsystem. However, from our mathematics analysis, we know this causation relationship does not exist.</p>

<p>According to Einstein’s theory that <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Matter-Cannot-Travel-Faster-Than-Light/">matter cannot travel faster than light</a>, anything that has mass could not travel faster than light speed. The “instance information transimission velocity” in the entangled quantum system does not vilate Einstein’s theory, in my opinion, because it is not transimission at all and should not be considered as velocity.</p>



<p>For example, suppose we have two pre-synchronized accurate clock in Beijing, China and San Francisco, USA, respectively. At 0:00 AM PST according to the two clocks, two people at Beijing and San Francisco send a light beam to a satellite simutaneously. The satellite will receive the two light beams almost simutaneously. Without knowing what is happening on the earth, can the satellite draw conclusion that because the two people from Beijing and San Francisco were sending light beams simutaneously, these two people must have communicated with each other before sending the light beams, and the communication velocity is greater than light speed? The answer is defnitely no.</p>

        <p>Before you will spend the next 10 to 20 minutes reading about eBPF, let me say a few words to start this blog. This is my first blog post and it originates from a paper I had to write for class in Uni a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed learning about eBPF and thought it’s a good topic to start my own blog, with the goal of posting here once in a while about tech stuff I have been working or playing with. If you find things that are wrong and need to be corrected, or just want to contact me for other reasons, feel free to reach out through any forms of contact mentioned on this website.</p>
<p>That’s all I have to say really, so lets get into the cool stuff.</p>
<p>The <em>extended Berkeley Packet Filter</em> (eBPF) provides a way of accessing in-kernel data structures and functions, which enables processing data directly in the kernel without copying it to user-space.</p>
<p>In this post, we will talk about eBPF. Starting with its predecessor called BPF, initially described by <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">McCanne and Jacobson</a>, I will also explain eBPFs architecture and cover how security risks introduced by the concept of executing user-space code in kernel-space are mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need&nbsp;eBPF?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of programs, e.g. network monitors, run as user-level processes. In order to analyze data that passes only through the kernel, they have to copy that data into user-space memory and perform context switches. That results in a significant performance overhead compared to analyzing that data directly inside the kernel.</p>
<p>Additionally, network speeds and traffic volumes have increased exponentially in recent years. Certain applications have to handle huge amounts of data. For example, the video-streaming service Netflix is accountable for about <a href="https://www.sandvine.com/hubfs/downloads/phenomena/2018-%20phenomena-report.pdf">15% of the global downstream volume</a>.</p>
<p>At some point, monitoring that much traffic only in user-space is no longer feasible and one solution is to use eBPF programs.</p>
<p>Besides performance benefits, eBPF programs offer safety and flexibility as it is possible to write and compile eBPF programs at run-time. By not doing any direct kernel programming (e.g. kernel modules), we avoid recompiling the kernel with every change. We also prevent resource lock-ups, potential memory corruption, entire system crashes and introducing security risks.</p>
<p><strong>What is&nbsp;eBPF?</strong></p>
<p>The eBPF is a full VM inside the kernel, that allows user-space programs to access a subset of kernel functions. One of the main advantages of eBPF is that you do not have to write kernel modules and there is no need to recompile the kernel for eBPF programs to take effect.</p>
<p>Programs can live in user-space, load the eBPF part of the program into the kernel, then get processed and attached to the correct place by the eBPF VM. The user-space program can then read any results from the eBPF program it loaded via data structures (eBPF maps) that are readable in user-space.</p>
<p>The kernel functions that are accessible by eBPF are mostly used for tracing and filtering directly inside the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-ofhistory">A bit of&nbsp;history</h2>
<p><strong>The BSD Packet Filter</strong></p>
<p>BPF was introduced in 1992 in the paper <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf"><em>The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for User-level Packet Capture</em></a>. At the time of writing, BPF was about two years old and running in the BSD Kernel. McCanne and Jacobson defined BPF to have two main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network tap that collects packets from the network driver and forwards them to listening filter applications.</li>
<li>The packet filter, realized by an in-kernel VM that runs bytecode which will perform the filtering actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, they describe BPF as a very well performing tool to monitor, capture, and filter networking packets. The paper continues with a comparison of BPF to other filtering mechanisms, which are shown to be outperformed by BPF.</p>
<p>McCanne and Jacobson also outline some of the design constraints for BPF. Two of them are important for its future development:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“It must be protocol independent. The kernel should not have to be modified to add new protocol support.”</em></li>
<li><em>“It must be general. The instruction set should be rich enough to handle unforeseen uses.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Those constraints allowed BPF to transform into what we know as eBPF today.</p>
<p><strong>Extended BPF</strong></p>
<p>While BPF was proven to have good performance, in 2013 Alexei Starovoitov proposed the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627"><em>extended BPF</em></a>.</p>
<p>Building upon the generality and protocol independence of BPF, his proposal allowed read-only access to certain in-kernel data structures. This enables many more tracing capabilities for eBPF since it is <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/2/1066">not just limited to networking functions</a>.</p>
<p>Starovoitov also introduced some changes to modernize the architecture and further improve performance. Most notably:</p>
<ol>
<li>The instruction set was extended. BPF had two 32-bit registers, eBPF has eleven 64-bit registers.</li>
<li>eBPF uses <em>Just-In-Time</em> (JIT) compilation.</li>
<li>It is possible to write eBPF programs in restricted C.</li>
</ol>
<p>In March 2016, Branden Gregg posted <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-03-05/linux-bpf-%20superpowers.html">an article on his blog</a> arguing that eBPF brings “superpowers” to Linux. He describes how eBPF gives him much more insight into Netflix’s production servers and introduces the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc"><em>BPF Compiler Collection</em> (BCC)</a>.</p>
<p>This set of tools he and others developed are making use eBPFs tracing functionalities to give various insights into the operating system stack. Today BCC also offers various Programming language (Go, Python, etc.) support to write eBPF programs.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>In this section, we will see the higher level architecture of eBPF as well as some details on the VM design.</p>
<p>When talking about VMs, most people will think of virtualization and containerization. These are techniques to abstract the hardware or operating system level to higher level software. In the case of eBPFs VM this is not true. The eBPF VM translates eBPF bytecode into native code, just as the JVM translates java bytecode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executing user-space code in the kernel introduces some risks. The common understanding without eBPF is a strict split between user-space and kernel-space. So how does eBPF guarantee safety when breaking that model? To answer that question, the section introduces the <em>Verifier</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Program flow</strong></p>
<p>To show the higher level architecture of eBPF lets go over the program flow of a user writing code that leverages eBPF to access kernel-space functions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/eBPF/linux_ebpf_internals.png"><img src="https://rgo3.dev/img/ebpf-architecture.png" alt="eBPF architecture from a user/kernel split perspective"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>A user-space program has to generate eBPF bytecode. To do this a user can either write C code, use existing tools, or an available programming language extension which can be found in the BCC.</li>
<li>The generated bytecode needs to be loaded into the Kernel. For that Linux has introduced a new system call: bpf(). It is available in Linux since v.3.18 (released in December 2014), which was the first release to include eBPF.</li>
<li>The eBPF bytecode gets verified by the <em>Verifier</em>. We will look into its specific role later but its purpose is to verify the loaded bytecode to be safe for execution inside the kernel.</li>
<li>The eBPF VM JIT-compiles the bytecode into native code for the underlying architecture and attaches it to the correct place. The image above shows various examples of in-kernel functions to use. E.g. <em>kprobes</em> was developed to do dynamic kernel tracing or its user- level equivalent <em>uprobes</em> which enables dynamic user- level tracing.</li>
<li>eBPF has two ways of communicating back to user-space. It can either emit per-event details, or write results into BPF maps that are readable by the user program. These maps can represent <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html">arrays, hash maps, histograms and other common data structures</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>A VM inside the kernel</strong></p>
<p>Now that we understand the higher-level architecture and the program flow of running eBPF programs, we want to look at some details of the VM itself. The eBPF VM is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) register machine.</p>
<p>This means that eBPF, as any hardware Instruction Set (x86, amd64, ARM), has its own instructions and a number of registers, reduced to the functionality of calling in-kernel functions.</p>
<p>Starovoitov described this RISC register machine in <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627">his first eBPF proposal</a>. eBPF has eleven registers and its calling convention is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>R0 is the return register for in-kernel helper functions.</li>
<li>R1 — R5 are in-kernel function argument registers.</li>
<li>R6 — R9 are callee saved registers.</li>
<li>R10 is a read-only frame pointer register to access the stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>While eBPF already enables for faster execution of these programs due to running them directly in the kernel and saving on context switches between user-space and the kernel, this design allows for minimal performance overhead as well because eBPFs bytecode instruction set and all its eleven registers can be mapped 1-to-1 with modern 64-bit hardware architectures (x86, amd64, ARM) when JIT-compiling to native code.</p>
<p><strong>The Verifier</strong></p>
<p>As tempting it seems to execute user-space code directly in kernel-space, it should immediately raise security questions. There is a reason why the original operating system design separates these two address spaces. Operating system security is deeply rooted in the user/kernel split design. But eBPF has a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>The solution is to verify the code for safety by the <em>Verifier</em>. Code verification is a complex problem, unsolvable even if you try to verify arbitrary code for its outcome as proven by Alan Turing in 1936 with <a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230">the halting problem</a>.</p>
<p>That means the <em>Verifier</em> needs to impose certain limitations on the code we are able to execute in the kernel with eBPF. While this of course implicates drawbacks for the power of eBPF, it is a necessary part of running untrusted code in the kernel.</p>
<p><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/30/627">Starovoitov’s proposal</a> essentially outlines the following protection mechanisms used by the <em>Verifier</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run a <em>Depth-First-Search</em> to disallow loops.</li>
<li>Simulate an eBPF program instruction for instruction and check register contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>These mechanisms have big implications for eBPF programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not Turing complete because we do not allow endless loops. This is very important to satisfy one of the motivations mentioned in the beginning.</li>
<li>We are able to avoid problems such as system lockups. If a user were able to submit a eBPF program containing an endless loop, that would effectively enable a <em>Denial-of- …</em></li></ul></div></div>

<h3>What’s the digital equivalent of sticky notes?</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Hey</p>



<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Notes</p>



<p>I could go on and on …</p></div></div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Looking to lower your cloud costs?</h3>
<p>Our “Cloud Done Right: Effective Cost Management” eBook provides tried, tested, and proven cost management methods for both Azure and AWS.</p>
<p>It shines a light on some of the most common cloud-related misconceptions and provides real-world examples of how to successfully leverage the cloud to see a return on investment.</p>
<p>In it, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to effectively combine your migration &amp; modernisation efforts</li>
<li>How to save up to 72% with Azure Reserved Instances</li>
<li>How to use AWS Cost Management to control your expenses</li>
<li>How AWS Serverless architecture costs compare to traditional hosting</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s inside the “Cloud Done Right: Effective Cost Management” eBook?</h2>
<h3>Cloud Modernisation &amp; Migration: The Perfect Pair?</h3>
<p>IDG’s survey found that 67% of respondents see modernisation efforts as essential to digital transformation. However, migration for the sake of migration isn’t the right catalyst for cloud adoption. We recommend looking at the big picture and figuring out what you’d like your systems to look like in the long run. This section of the eBook covers how to effectively approach your migration and modernisation needs, what to avoid on your cloud journey, and how to select the right cloud partner.</p>
<h3>Azure Cloud Cost Management: Key Optimisations</h3>
<p>Azure cost management and optimisation require practical knowledge and insight – in fact, you might even need to conduct an audit of your infrastructure. However, the key to effective cost optimisation is to get value within a short period of time. Otherwise, you might overinvest in an investigation that could yield findings not worth the time and effort. In this section of the eBook, you’ll learn about certain quick tweaks you can make to your Azure infrastructure to save a portion of your budget.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost Management: How to Control Expenses?</h3>
<p>According to IDG, 69% of organisations find that their cloud costs are higher than they anticipated. The AWS Cost Management tool suite allows customers to quickly and easily generate custom billing reports. This section of the eBook will teach you how to generate sample reports and help you familiarise yourself with a few quick wins, which we identified in our cloud projects.</p>
<h3>Do More &amp; Pay Less with AWS Serverless</h3>
<p>While, in theory, the FaaS computing model promises that you will bear ‘no costs for idle servers’, the question is: how does this work in practice? Are there any hidden costs and, if so, where are they? For this section of the eBook, we created an example booking web application to calculate how much an AWS Serverless solution actually costs. The results of the experiment will enable you to learn how AWS Serverless architecture is billed and how to estimate the associated monthly costs.</p>

			<div>
<p>This summer I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 at PostgreSQL Global Development Group. During these 3 months, I was working on performance and safety features for <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-G</a> utility. I went through this summer journey together with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/g0djan">Georgy Rylov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x4m">Andrey Borodin</a>. In this post, I will mainly focus on the work done during the program.</p>



<p>WAL-G is a tool written in Go for backing up and restoring PostgreSQL clusters (most recently MySQL, MongoDB, and FoundationDB too). It supports Amazon S3 storages (and S3 compatible analogs, like Yandex Object Storage), as well as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Swift Object Storage, and the file system.</p>



<p>In its core functionality, WAL-G is a successor of WAL-E but written in Go. WAL-G works much faster than WAL-E and also has some new cool features, one of them is delta-backups. Delta-backup, whenever possible, stores only pages, changed since the previous backup. When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last base backup plus all of the delta<em> </em>backups until the point of restoration.</p>



<p>The goal of the project was to make two enhancements:</p>



<p>The first one was to improve the performance of the backup fetch process by implementing delta-backups unpacking in reverse order to avoid rewriting the same pages along with the following backup structure reorganization to avoid downloading unnecessary files.</p>



<p>The second was to provide users with the features to verify backup consistency, such as WAL’s history consistency check and page checksum verification.</p>



<p>These two enhancements were implemented as four features:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#unpackreverse">Unpack delta-backups in reverse order</a></li><li><a href="#reorganizebackup">Reorganize backup structure to avoid downloading unnecessary files</a></li><li><a href="#walhistorycheck">WAL’s history consistency check</a></li><li><a href="#checksumverification">Page checksum verification</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the four features by now are merged into WAL-G master branch. You can try them by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g"> WAL-G repo</a>.</p>



<h2 id="unpackreverse">Unpacking delta backups in reverse order</h2>



<p>When restoring from delta backup, WAL-G at first unpacks the oldest version of the page files from base backup and then applies delta backups to the base version in historical order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CSh90AC62ojlPE7uCv0Ms2xl-buHF--mp3qZ8mb6bCGeK3V7D-S_92aaOTHFBI0h6NuAZ6fCci8DdV__6_kwh2sfVrYGsYSE1FAdWhCiHO-HxV9rygxaJXR112AuT9ERexCQkMYt" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G default backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that there are page blocks in the older backup which are going to be completely overwritten by their version from the newer backup, thus resulting in unnecessary writes to disk. The main goal of this feature was to improve backup fetch performance by implementing an unpack of delta backups in reverse order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEyTQyTvj1VzFKlSO4Jd2FQW_xofm2TBKxnHXSyY7AN94SDPFDppYL6E7J4F7QFspmLTqoFIrSVJlGIdPT99aNOV0ABgiRoNPjAmH7upqLWHy6xE5JHB3KDnDjkbEeppyAXFRzvF" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this approach, pages are written to the disk only once, which noticeably improves backup restore performance. The main idea was to create page files from the latest delta backup at first, then fill the missing information from the following delta backups and the base backup.</p>



<p>The following text describes how WAL-G creates the page file without unnecessary page overwrites. It will focus on the most non-trivial case when the page file was modified multiple times since the first appearance in the base backup. Other more trivial cases are omitted for briefness. The page file is restored using the following scheme:</p>



<ol><li>Create page file from delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the previous delta</li><li>…</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the first delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the base backup</li></ol>



<h4>Create page file from delta</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G3T7fENlEHMmJUn327j1rAPyO_dzHDMYj8b7UCi5fVuTs1r_BCiO2lADT4feALN5NHdeD28F5XBVFdi5_2GQwrPqS5IRw4jpzA-T5V6EBYUwoXGwqxi0NwJDl5Y1OjQLc_RBBRmd" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G increment file header</figcaption></figure>



<p>WAL-G uses the information from the header of the delta page file to extract the final size of the page file. Knowing the final size of the page file and the PostgreSQL page size, it is possible to calculate the page count needed to write on the disk. For each page WAL-G performs the following algorithm to write the pagefile:</p>



<ol><li>If this page exists in delta backup, write it to the page file</li><li>If this page does not exist in the delta, write an empty page block to the page file</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ov865hrbNync4w4GYeICfb4qU2q4elCY5xetoJ2fglJgSjORdAPW_ywlJmHJE2t3LXjhxFheOkZ-BKnBWkQGs8YcoogD9E-dR8aZS55TyIJq-4O9DBkW9RjTvq9VSRzwfwYi25ij" alt="" width="372" height="249"><figcaption>Structure of the created page file</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the N-th delta to the page file</h4>



<p>For each next delta, WAL-G needs to write only the missing information to the page files. For each page in N-th delta backup WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the page from delta</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qraIB_-HykTegsB2Hkuhf1GsyCcL_p8PWXYwQKzKeWC1zAQBaXA0jxa6t2WcKBycDR3zG51BZhdMBftYucTB0XB3QfXnCL9JT36FlrW9uUvV-a1zv7D6ujxt0NFKGwNvwOpdwoQq" alt=""><figcaption>Application of N-th delta to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the base backup to the page file</h4>



<p>After WAL-G reached the base backup, it needs to get the missing pages from the base backup page file version. For each page in the local page file WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the base backup page</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9lBoXoMFN54cDWH9GCyXVgz4k_VxHYG6xAhmude06gNmTrVF7tLHzIHOgXwNIXSJ3jgwuXjM8P4FjK9JraZSjOtdLC4J2U1Nkf_P7nvuU-dJJN35FsZqAITcr9NrTxBDTICWh7t_" alt=""><figcaption>Application of base backup to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve implemented the proposed approach and measured performance improvement. WAL-G with reverse delta unpack turned on demonstrated about 2.5x faster backup restore compared to the standard WAL-G. If you are interested in more details, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/benchmarks/reverse-delta-unpack-26-03-2020.md">complete benchmark report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reorganizebackup">Reorganization of backup structure</h2>



<p>After the implementation of the reverse delta unpack feature disk load and overall performance during backup-fetch<strong> </strong>has been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, WAL-G still needed to download absolutely all backup files from the cloud. However, with the reverse delta unpack feature implemented it wasn’t longer necessary – for example, there may have been a situation when WAL-G already had a consistent local version (no missing page blocks) of each file in the archive that was going to be downloaded. In this case, the archive contained only outdated files that aren’t useful anyway, so WAL-G can skip the download of the entire archive and proceed to the next one. The goal was to avoid downloading these unnecessary archives from the cloud and improve the WAL-G backup fetch performance even more 🙂</p>



<p>WAL-G stores each backup in the cloud split into several compressed archives. The problem is that to check which files exist in the archive you need to download and decompress it from the storage. The main idea is quite simple – store the contents of each archive in a backup JSON sentinel file so WAL-G can skip the archives without interesting files without downloading them.</p>



<pre><code>{ // this is a sample backup sentinel JSON file 
  "PgVersion": 120002,
  "UncompressedSize": 500781396,
  "CompressedSize": 100243768,
  "LSN": 17448304680,
  "DeltaCount": 8,
  "DeltaFromLSN": 16743661608,
  "SystemIdentifier": 6847498813832237599,
  "DeltaFullName": "base_00000003000000030000002F",
  "TarFileSets": { // new field to store information of contents of each tar archive here
    "part_001.tar.lz4": [
      "/",
      "/base",
      "/base/1",
      "/base/13689",
      "/base/13690",
      "/base/16384",
      "/base/16384/1259",
      "/base/16384/16397",
...
    ],
    "part_003.tar.lz4": [
      "tablespace_map",
      "backup_label"
    ]
  },
  "Files": {...},
  "DeltaFrom": "base_0000000300000003000000E6_D_0000000300000003000000D6",
  "FinishLSN": 17448304952,
  "Spec": null
}</code></pre>



<p>We’ve successfully implemented this approach and now WAL-G stores the contents of each backup archive in backup sentinel JSON by default. However, with this approach, the case when all of the files in the archive can be skipped may be quite rare. For a file that is being updated frequently, there is a high chance that some delta backup will contain only outdated information about it that WAL-G won’t need. And vice versa, if some file is being updated rarely, there is a high chance that delta backup will still hold some required data so we can’t skip the archive containing this file and we need to download the entire archive.</p>



<p>That’s why we developed an additional backup creation mode (<code><code>rating composer</code></code>) based on file update ratings. The idea was to place the files with a similar update frequency in the same archives so we can get the higher chance of the entire archive to be skipped. WAL-G needed to somehow determine the update frequency for each file in the database cluster folder. Luckily, for paged files, there is information from Postgres statistics collector – particularly <code>n_tup_ins</code>, <code>n_tup_del</code>, <code>n_tup_upd</code> columns from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> view.</p>







<p>In the rating composer mode, during backup creation, for each file WAL-G calculates the updates count using the data from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> and stores it in the current backup sentinel JSON. If available, WAL-G also reads the <code>previousUpdatesCount</code> – previous updates count value from the previous backup sentinel JSON. Using these values WAL-G then calculates the <code>updateRating</code> for each file: <code>(currentUpdatesCount * 100) / previousUpdatesCount</code>. Finally, all that left to do is:</p>



<ol><li>Sort all the files in the current backup by their <code>updateRating</code></li><li>Start packing files into archive from the file with the highest update rating</li><li>When the size of the files packed in the current archive exceeds the <code>WALG_TAR_SIZE_THRESHOLD</code> limit, create the new archive, and go to step 2.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, seems like we’re done… But actually no. To speed up things a little bit, WAL-G can do concurrent packing of multiple tar archives during backup creation (<code>WALG_UPLOAD_DISK_CONCURRENCY</code> setting). If you look closely, the above algorithm can’t be parallelized in straightforward …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>curl 4.8 was released in 1998 and contained 46 command line options. <code>curl --help</code> would list them all. A decent set of options.</p>



<p>When we released <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">curl 7.72.0</a> a few weeks ago, it contained 232 options… and <code>curl --help</code> still listed all available options.</p>



<p>What was once a long list of options grew over the decades into a crazy long wall of text shock to users who would enter this command and option, thinking they would figure out what command line options to try next.</p>



<h2>–help me if you can</h2>



<p>We’ve known about this usability flaw for a while but it took us some time to figure out how to approach it and decide what the best next step would be. Until this year when long time curl veteran Dan Fandrich did his presentation at curl up 2020 titled <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/video/curlup-2020/help%2520me%2520if%2520you%2520can.webm">–help me if you can</a>.</p>



<p>Emil Engler subsequently picked up the challenge and converted ideas surfaced by Dan into reality and proper code. Today we merged the refreshed and improved <code>--help</code> behavior in curl.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most notable change in curl for many users in a long time. Targeted for inclusion in the pending 7.73.0 release.</p>



<h2>help categories</h2>



<p>First out, <code>curl --help</code> will now by default only list a small subset of the most “important” and frequently used options. No massive wall, no shock. Not even necessary to pipe to <code>more</code> or <code>less</code> to see proper.</p>



<p>Then: each curl command line option now has one or more categories, and the help system can be asked to just show command line options belonging to the particular category that you’re interested in.</p>



<p>For example, let’s imagine you’re interested in seeing what curl options provide for your HTTP operations:</p>



<pre>$ curl --help http
Usage: curl [options…]
http: HTTP and HTTPS protocol options
--alt-svc Enable alt-svc with this cache file
--anyauth Pick any authentication method
--compressed Request compressed response
-b, --cookie Send cookies from string/file
-c, --cookie-jar Write cookies to after operation
-d, --data HTTP POST data
--data-ascii HTTP POST ASCII data
--data-binary HTTP POST binary data
--data-raw HTTP POST data, '@' allowed
--data-urlencode HTTP POST data url encoded
--digest Use HTTP Digest Authentication
[...]</pre>



<h2>list categories</h2>



<p>To figure out what help categories that exists, just ask with <code>curl --help category</code>, which will show you a list of the current twenty-two categories:<strong> auth, connection, curl, dns, file, ftp, http, imap, misc, output, pop3, post, proxy, scp, sftp, smtp, ssh, telnet ,tftp, tls, upload and verbose.</strong> It will also display a brief description of each category.</p>



<p>Each command line option can be put into multiple categories, so the same one may be displayed in both in the “http” category as well as in “upload” or “auth” etc.</p>



<h2><code>--help all</code></h2>



<p>You can of course still get the old list of every single command line option by issuing <code>curl --help all</code>. Handy for grepping the list and more.</p>



<h2>“important”</h2>



<p>The meta category “important” is what we use for the options that we show when just <code>curl --help</code> is issued. Presumably those options should be the most important, in some ways.</p>

<p>My mother told me that when I was very young, I would always look out the window in the evenings for the police car that would often sit on our street each night during the late shift. On a night when a car didn’t appear, and my father couldn’t get me to sleep, he would put me in a stroller and walk around until we saw one. I grew up on shows like Dragnet and games like Police Quest, and when I told my neighbors that I wanted to be a cop when I grew up, they’d tell me, “You’re too smart for that.”</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Years later, when I was in university, I watched friends get harassed by police. I’d watch videos of excessive force leading to accidental shootings. I had friends who were facing thousands of dollars in fines and legal fees, as well as jail time or community service, for possession of marijuana. A black friend of mine had the police called on him, while he was jogging in his own neighborhood. I watched police illegally search vehicles on my street in Cincinnati, and my friends and I would call out “<em>careful, pigs</em>” when we saw police vehicles out on the side of the road.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/security/police/">much younger me</a> would probably join with much of the anti-police rhetoric we see today. Yet, despite all of this, I remember that police are still human. Back when I still had my <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/faith/">faith</a>, every Sunday I’d sit in a pew next to a good friend whose father was a cop, and a church elder. In my current city, a police officer I know hosts traveling folk musicians for large concerts in his home. In New Zealand, a police officer did a full investigation after a <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/philosophy/faith/fate-and-destiny/">break-in</a>, even though it was likely to be a fruitless endeavor. I’ve watched police officers not only de-escalate situations, but do some amazing and incredible things, beyond what they needed to do for their job.</p>

<h3 id="body-cameras-tell-a-different-story">Body Cameras Tell a Different Story</h3>

<p>Both patrol car cameras and police body cameras provide a tremendous amount of context to situations, something which has never been available before. They’ve been pivotal in showing misconduct and holding police accountable, such as when Trooper Matthew Spina of Connecticut threatened to throw someone over a bridge during a traffic stop<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">1</a></sup>. But they’ve also been incredibly effective in clearing police in controversial incidents.</p>

<p>In September 2019, protests were held in St. Paul, Minnesota over a police officer fatally shooting Ronald Davis. People were crying out for justice, yet eventually police body camera footage revealed that Davis rammed a police vehicle, and within seconds, ran toward the police car and repeatedly attempted to stab the officer with a knife<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">2</a></sup>. Similarly, De’Von Bailey was a man shot in Colorado Springs in August of 2019. Many activist protested his death, both on the street and on social media, claiming the shooting was murder. However, the combination of the 911 call and police body camera footage clearly showed that De’Von had a firearm, and attempted to pull the firearm as he ran from police officers<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Donut Operator, a former police officer turned YouTuber and skateboard shop owner, does some amazing breakdowns of police shootings based on body camera and security camera footage. His coverage of these events really opened my eyes to the complexities of these police shootings, and the differences between how they’re often portrayed in the media compared to how they actually transpired. I don’t agree with all his breakdowns, such as in a recent video where he praises a police officer who shoots a man who took a hostage in Salt Lake City<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">4</a></sup>. The officer didn’t attempt to de-escalate the situation, and it could have gone horribly wrong had the officer missed and hit the hostage. The family of the hostage taker also criticized the actions as unnecessary<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Still, the body camera provides a truly incredible tool for objectively evaluating police actions. They help hold both police and the people they investigate accountable. In Louisville, after a fatal shooting in May, police officers were relieved of duty, and the police chief was fired, after it was found the officers did not have their body cameras activated<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">6</a></sup>. As more police departments adopt body cameras, hopefully we will see an increase of zero tolerance policies for officers who intentionally disable them.</p>

<h3 id="recent-events">Recent Events</h3>

<p>The activism and riots in the aftermath of the George Floyd incident in Minneapolis were the result of video taken from onlookers, after Floyd was on the ground. The video is graphic, but it also lacks the context of everything that happened up to that point. The prosecutor refused to release the actual body camera footage, until it was eventually leaked by the Daily Mail on August 3rd, 2020<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">7</a></sup>. Eventually, a country judge ordered that the full footage be released.</p>

<p>Floyd is a highly polarizing case, and I’m not going to make any comments on it, other than that I suggest you watch the full body camera footage from the incident. There are several videos, one fifteen minutes in length from the perspective of Officer Tou Thao, and another from the body cameras of Officers Thomas Lane and J. Kueng, that is an hour in length<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>No matter what your current opinion is of the incident, if you haven’t seen them, you really need to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gQYMBALDXc">the full body camera videos</a> in entirety. They paint a drastically different narrative that the one that’s been fed to the world by the major media networks. The fact that the prosecutors withheld this evidence is nothing short of pure media manipulation.</p>

<h3 id="activists">Activists</h3>

<p>Carey Wedler is an activist who I have a lot of respect for. In 2018, she put out a video describing an incident where police raided the house of an activist she was staying with. The police entered while she was in the shower. She quickly jumped out and dressed, only to be detained with everyone in the house. She was on her period, and repeatedly asked to use the bathroom. Assured a female police officer was on the way, she waited for hours as she bled on herself. The female officer who arrived, gave her advice on how to get the blood out of her skirt. Despite all of this, she made a video about why she doesn’t harbor hatred for police over this incident.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…I don’t buy into the myth of the violent war on cops, because the statistics prove it’s not real. And I know that, while police advocates shun the problem of unarmed people getting killed, there are countless more who are beaten and maimed. But what I also now believe is that demonizing police at every turn hasn’t stopped the wave of police violence and killings. However much I disagree with the tactics, the authority and the institution, it remains that many of these officers are acting with good intentions. They may be enforcing injustices, but because of wide spread societal programming that obeying authority is good, they think they’re doing good deeds. It’s not their fault this was driven into them, or anyone else. Many cops actually do want to help others and keep them safe, even if the laws they’re enforcing make the problems worse and increase crime…” -Carey Wedler<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In her video, Wedler carefully navigates the waters of opposing submission to authority, while also warning her audience of the risks of dehumanizing police. The cry of protesters with catchphrases like <em>“All Cops are Bastards”</em>, creates a new <em>other</em> and a way to rationalize violence towards another group of human beings by removing our collective humanity.</p>

<h3 id="disbanding-the-police">Disbanding the Police</h3>

<p>In the wake of George Floyd, there have been continual calls to disband entire police departments. America has disbanded a police force once before, in 2003 under the government of George W. Bush, in a place called Baghdad. An immediate disbanding of police, without any foresight into reconstruction, led to massive looting, violence, and the emergence of warlords creating their own structures of control<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">10</a></sup>, not entirely unlike the region of <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/video/chaz-seattle-and-the-mob/">CHAZ</a> in Seattle, except at a considerably larger scale.</p>

<p>Supporters of disbanding will often bring up Camden, New Jersey, where the municipal police force was disbanded in 2012. But Camden wasn’t a situation where the police force was dismissed without forethought. Instead, a regional police department was formed, with funds and personnel being transferred into the new organization<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">11</a></sup>. There was a plan, and a clear path forward, which maintained police presence during the transition.</p>

<p>The wording has changed in some media from <em>disbanding</em> to <em>defunding</em> the police, with an emphasis on moving funds from the police into other community programs. However, cutting funds works at cross purposes with changes that would increase police accountability. Many departments lack the money to purchase body cameras<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">12</a></sup>. One might argue that cutting funding would force departments to move money away from military grade equipment, but most of that equipment isn’t paid for by municipalities. It comes from the Federal Government via the 1033 Program implemented under George H. W. Bush<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Texas, the city of Austin voted to cut $150 million, nearly a third, of their police budget<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">14</a></sup>. The mayor of Seattle vetoed $4 million in cuts to her own police department, but the city’s Police Chief, Carmen Best, still resigned as she faced a nearly $20,000 cut to her income<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">15</a></sup>. It’s already difficult for police departments to afford good training and personnel, and I do not see these proposed cuts ending well.</p>

<h3 id="police-are-human-beings">Police are Human Beings</h3>

<p>When I was in my twenties, one of my best friends said that he wanted to run for public office. He mentioned how he’d run on a message of needing fewer police, and how it would lead us to be safer. A younger me believed in this hardliner, …</p></article></section></div></div>

<h2>System of Systems for Business and Startup Management for Companies with &lt;50 Employees</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="406" height="235" src="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image.png 406w, https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px"></figure>



<h2>ABOUT </h2>



<p>Every small business has to solve many of the same problems such as:</p>



<ul><li>“How do I hire great people?”</li><li>“How do I run a board of directors?” </li><li>“How do I measure personality traits?”</li><li>“How do I run team meetings?”</li><li><span>“How do I measure employee happiness?”</span></li><li>“How do I do vision, strategy and planning?”</li></ul>



<p>I spent the last three years choosing the best-of-the-best systems for the most common business challenges. </p>



<p>The result is this “system of systems” I call “The Playbook.” </p>



<h2>DESIGN GOALS</h2>



<p> •    <strong>Highest Impact.</strong> It’s the 20% of activities in operating a business that provides 80% of the results. This playbook should focus on those items.</p>



<p>  •    <strong>Self-Implementation.</strong> At this size of the company, consultants to implement these systems are not possible. </p>



<p>•    <strong>Tactical over Theoretical.</strong> Business books are usually at a concept-level. This makes sense because concepts don’t change. The tactics do change. So, we focus on systems that are actionable and tactical.</p>



<p> •    <strong>Bare Minimum.</strong> If a system isn’t essential, cut it out. Time is in the shortest supply as business leaders and anything that unnecessarily takes that has got to go.</p>



<h2>“THE PLAYBOOK”</h2>



<p>These are the best-of-breed system for each common business challenge.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="230" src="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1.png 590w, https://girdley.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-1-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"></figure>



<p>Each subsequent section will speak to each of these systems.</p>



<p>We’ll conclude with a guide for implementation.</p>



<h2>EOS (“ENTREPRENEURIAL OPERATING SYSTEM”) </h2>



<p><strong><em>Solving for coordination as a team grows.</em></strong></p>



<p>Traction is the name of a book by Gino Wickman written to describe his concept of an “Entrepreneurial Operating System” (EOS). </p>



<p>The system is a combination of principles, templates and habits deployed inside of businesses to solve for common issues that occur as a business matures. It can be deployed as early as the inception of the business.</p>



<p>The book can be found here:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are several ways to implement the system. Some
founders self-implement and others leverage outside consultants certified by
the author. Both can work. In smaller companies, self-implementing is usually
the best since it is much cheaper.</p>



<p>The book does a great job of making this point, but I want
to reiterate it here: It takes time to implement all of these habits. A common
mistake is CEOs think they need to get it all deployed in a few weeks. The
reality is an established operating company can take years to deploy the
system.</p>



<p>There are other systems in existence. I prefer this one because it’s simpler to self-implement. As companies grow, they can graduate to deploy some of the more intensive systems like Scaling Up.</p>



<h2>CULTURE INDEX</h2>



<p>An assessment system that recognizes each person is
different with different strengths.</p>



<p>As we see in “First, Break All the Rules” in the section on
Managing People, the best managers deploy their staff to best use their
strengths. But, how do you develop a language to discuss those abilities?</p>



<p>Culture Index is a system that is used to do just that.</p>



<p>It’s a paid tool and the most expensive item of everything here in the Playbook:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cultureindex.com/">https://www.cultureindex.com/</a></p>



<h2>TOPGRADING</h2>



<p><strong><em>A system for finding “A-Players”</em></strong></p>



<p>Topgrading defines an “A-Player” as a performer in the top 10% of their pay band and role. We all want to hire those “Rock Stars.” But how?</p>



<p>The system has two core hypothesis about A-Players:<br> •    They have a track record of success.<br> •    They have tons of people in their history who will say great things about them.</p>



<p> Unfortunately, the Topgrading book is one of those business texts that has amazing ideas but is horribly written.  You can buy a copy here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Topgrading-3rd-Promoting-Turbocharges-Performance/">https://www.amazon.com/Topgrading-3rd-Promoting-Turbocharges-Performance/</a></p>



<p>Dr. Smart has passed away since publishing the book. His son has continued working in this space and published a book called “Who?” that is widely liked by many people. I dislike this book because it gives up on several of the ideas at the core of Topgrading.</p>



<p>In using Topgrading, I recommend each company adapt the comprehensive process that Dr. Smart describes. It is not universal and you do not need to use the entire thing to get the benefit of it.</p>



<h2>STORYBRAND</h2>



<p><strong><em>How to craft a story that resonates with customers</em></strong></p>



<p>What EOS/Traction is for operating a business, StoryBrand is that for marketing. It uses a set of templates, rules, and procedures to help a business deploy a useful narrative that resonates with customers.</p>



<p>Where this book shines is that it is a concrete set of steps for even a novice marketer to follow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is centered around the idea that every good marketing system is based on the “Hero’s Journey.” Your business is the “yoda” that helps your customers become heroes.</p>



<h2>NET PROMOTER SCORE (NPS)</h2>



<p><strong><em>The one question to track your customer satisfaction and the health of your company.</em></strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been asked, “How likely are you to recommend this service to a friend or colleague?” at the end of a customer service interaction then you’re familiar with Net Promoter Score (NPS).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>NPS is a great way to measure the number of fans (aka “promoters”) versus detractors. Promoters are great because they tell all their friends how great you are. </p>



<p>There are multiple ways to implement NPS. My favorite is a <a href="http://geekdomfund.com/">Geekdom Fund </a>portfolio company called <a href="http://promoter.io/">Promoter.io</a>.</p>







<p><strong><em>Measure Employee Engagement</em></strong></p>



<p>We all know that the hierarchical structure for organizations
isn’t perfect, but it’s better than all the other options out there. </p>



<p>The main downside of a rigid hierarchy is limited information for you as a CEO or business owner as to what’s happening with your employees and their engagement. And we know highly engaged employees are more likely to be high performers.</p>



<p>Ideally, we want to quantify engagement. My favorite tool for this is the Q12 tool:</p>



<p><a href="https://q12.gallup.com/public/en-us/Features">https://q12.gallup.com/public/en-us/Features</a></p>



<h2>MG BOARD GOVERNANCE </h2>



<p><strong><em>Lightweight, effective small company board system.</em></strong></p>



<p>I have not found a complete, solid board governance system so I created my own. Note that this system assumes a company has or is in the process of implementing the EOS framework. </p>



<p>I’m in the process of publishing this online soon.</p>



<h2>IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE</h2>



<p>I recommend rolling out this in the following manner:  Focus on EOS first. The rest will follow.</p>



<p>By the time a company reaches more than the founding team, the EOS framework has the greatest impact on the operations. Note that a full EOS rollout into an existing operating company can take up to two years. So, patience and persistence are key.</p>



<p>As needed, implement the other systems depending on the situation of the business. If, for example, hiring has been a challenge then consider Topgrading. If there are talent fit issues once people have been hired, consider Culture Index next. And so on.</p>



<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>



<p>Do you have systems that are essential and work for your small business or startup? </p>



<p>I’d love to hear about them: email to Michael at the girdley.com or on twitter @mgirdley.</p>

    </span></a></p>
<p>The complexity of cloud costs keeps increasing - When we were building PlanForCloud in 2012 AWS had just hit 10,000 different pricing points for their services - now there are over 300,000.</p>
<p>We found existing tools fit in too late in the process and are not aimed at the people in control of the infrastructure. It’s difficult to get cost estimations when you are building and deploying your services, which often leads to bill shock and no easy way to track down these costs. So we wanted to build a CLI tool that can plug into your existing development and operations processes and bring cost visibility to the engineers.</p>
<p>Currently Infracost supports AWS and Terraform, but we will add support for more cloud vendors (GCP, Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi).</p>
<p>We also want to go beyond just the baseline costs of infrastructure - data transfer costs and other usage-based costs can often be a significant portion of a cloud bill, and are also the hardest to predict and track down. If you have any ideas about the best way to handle these then please <a href="https://twitter.com/aliscott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Infracost is open source, you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/aliscott/infracost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/aliscott/infracost</a>.</p></section></div>]]>

<p>I like this as a metaphor for jelled teams. </p>



<p>In the neighborhood that is your team, are people borrowing cups of flour from each other? Are they carpooling to school? How much “hey neighbor, would you mind keeping an eye on my kids so I can run to the store?” is going on?</p>



<p>Replace cups of flour with, I dunno, pairing or rubber ducky debugging. Or swap babysitting the kids with babysitting a build. See where I’m going with this? </p>



<p>Is your team an old city neighborhood? Or is it just some people who happen to live in the same apartment block?</p>

<![CDATA[Creating a Video Streaming Server Using HLS]]>

September 4, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/04/golang-video-stream-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/04/golang-video-stream-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In this tutorial, I’m going to walk you through building a Golang video streaming API (this works for other types of media as well!). Don’t worry, its surprisingly easy to build a robust media streaming server, especially if we utilize one of the more modern protocols, HLS.</p>



<h2>What is HLS?</h2>



<blockquote><p>HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP-Based adaptive bitrate streaming communications protocol developed by Apple.</p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>HLS allows us to serve large media files as many smaller text files that are broken up into ~10-second increments. By breaking them up in this way, our user’s client-side app only needs to buffer 10 seconds in advance. This saves the user a lot of potential bandwidth and allows the song or video to start playback almost immediately.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFmpeg</a>, we can easily convert mp3 files to HLS format, which consists of multiple files. One of these files contains the metadata (.m3u8) and is served first. This metadata file tells the client where to get each data file, and what each data file contains. The data files have a .ts extension and typically contain ~10 seconds of audio and are served one-at-a-time at the client’s request.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1024x499.jpeg" alt="FFmpeg" width="348" height="169" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1024x499.jpeg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-300x146.jpeg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-768x374.jpeg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-100x49.jpeg 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w-1200x585.jpeg 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" title="1 mgCxTQSqrTvKsmDRmuRa7w"></figure></div>



<h2>Get Started – Format Some Media for your Server</h2>



<p>Download a sample .mp3:</p>



<p><a href="http://www.hubharp.com/web_sound/BachGavotteShort.mp3" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://www.hubharp.com/web_sound/BachGavotteShort.mp3</a></p>



<p>Install <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FFmpeg</a>. If you are on a Mac:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">brew install ffmpeg</code></pre>



<p>Navigate to the directory of the mp3 file and run</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">ffmpeg -i BachGavotteShort.mp3 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k -map 0:0 -f segment -segment_time 10 -segment_list outputlist.m3u8 -segment_format mpegts output%03d.ts</code></pre>



<p>This should result in three new files:</p>



<pre>output000.ts output001.ts outputlist.m3u8</pre>



<p>Congratulations! You are done with the hard part, you now have simple files that can be served over HTTP. Any modern client-side media library will know how to read HLS files.</p>



<h2>Building the Streaming Server</h2>



<p>As I eluded to above, HLS is very simple on the server-side. All we need to do is serve a path to the .m3u8 file, and make sure the .ts files are served from the same path. In traditional file server architecture, this just means that they need to be in the same directory.</p>



<p>Let’s set up our project with the following folder structure:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="217" height="135" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 12 03 at 8.57.28 AM" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM.png 217w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-03-at-8.57.28-AM-100x62.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px" title="Screen Shot 2019 12 03 at 8.57.28 AM"></figure></div>



<p>Copy the following code into main.go:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// configure the songs directory name and port
	const songsDir = "songs"
	const port = 8080

	// add a handler for the song files
	http.Handle("/", addHeaders(http.FileServer(http.Dir(songsDir))))
	fmt.Printf("Starting server on %v\n", port)
	log.Printf("Serving %s on HTTP port: %v\n", songsDir, port)

	// serve and log errors
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%v", port), nil))
}

// addHeaders will act as middleware to give us CORS support
func addHeaders(h http.Handler) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
		h.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	}
}</code></pre>



<p>Now run your server:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">go run main.go</code></pre>



<p>Your server is live! Test your music play by using a media client. You can find a free online client here: <a href="https://hls-js-latest.netlify.com/demo/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://hls-js-latest.netlify.com/demo/</a></p>



<p>Simply paste your song’s URI and listen:</p>



<pre>http://localhost:8080/bachgavotteshort/outputlist.m3u8</pre>

<p>I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn't seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find!  That's when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests?  I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I did over the past month!  I'm pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I've ever experienced.  I've discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also <em>why the code works the way it does</em>, and to explore edge cases while writing tests.  Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible!  It turns out the library I choose, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is a library on top of which many <a href="https://github.com/fastai">fast.ai</a> projects are built on. Most importantly, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:</strong>  I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages.</li>
<li><strong>You get a new set of pragmatic tools</strong>: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Learn more about the Python programming language:</strong>  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention.</p>

</div>
</div>

<hr>
<h2 id="Making-**kwargs-transparent">Making **kwargs transparent<a href="#Making-**kwargs-transparent"> </a></h2><p>Whenever I see a function that has the argument <strong>**kwargs</strong>, I cringe a little.  This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that <code>foo</code> also accepts and additional parameters <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>.  We can fix this with <code>delegates</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can customize the behavior of this decorator.  For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping <code>**kwargs</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude arguments.  For example, we exclude argument <code>d</code> from delegation:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also delegate between classes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes">Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes<a href="#Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes"> </a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in <code>__init__</code>?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Ouch! That was painful.  Look at all the repeated variable names.  Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class?  Not Anymore!  Checkout <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">store_attr</a>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude certain attributes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>There are many more ways of customizing and using <code>store_attr</code> than I highlighted here.  Check out <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">the docs</a> for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate">Avoiding subclassing boilerplate<a href="#Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate"> </a></h2><p>One thing I hate about python is the <code>__super__().__init__()</code> boilerplate associated with subclassing.  For example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#PrePostInitMeta">PrePostInitMeta</a>.  We define a new class called <code>NewParent</code> that is a wrapper around the <code>ParentClass</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>

<h2 id="Type-Dispatch">Type Dispatch<a href="#Type-Dispatch"> </a></h2><p>Type dispatch, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">Multiple dispatch</a>, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives.  This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">conceptual example</a> of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting spaceship</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting spaceship</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box.  Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html#typedispatch-Decorator">@typedispatch</a> decorator to the rescue.  This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function <code>f</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html">you can read about here</a>. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch">multipledispatch</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin">Mathhew Rocklin</a> (the creator of Dask).</p>
<p>After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p><code>functools.partial</code> is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= <code>val</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can create a new function out of this function using <code>partial</code> that sets the default value to 5:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with <code>partial</code> is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Composition-of-functions">Composition of functions<a href="#Composition-of-functions"> </a></h2><p>A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result.  This is especially useful when applying various data transformations.  Consider a toy example where I have three functions:  (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>But why is this useful?  You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>arrsum</span><span>(</span><span>add2</span><span>(</span><span>filter5</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>])))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You are not wrong!  However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>For more information about <code>compose</code>, read <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#compose">the docs</a>.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-more-useful-__repr__">A more useful <code>__repr__</code><a href="#A-more-useful-__repr__"> </a></h2><p>In python, <code>__repr__</code> helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging.  Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using <code>store_attr</code>, which was discussed earlier).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can use <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#basic_repr">basic_repr</a> to quickly give us a more sensible default:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator">Monkey Patching With A Decorator<a href="#Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator"> </a></h2><p>It can be convenient to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/">monkey patch</a> with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing.  We can use the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#patch">decorator @patch</a> from <code>fastcore.foundation</code> along with type hints like so:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now, <code>MyClass</code> has an additional method named <code>func</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Still not convinced?  I'll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>

<h2 id="A-better-pathlib.Path">A better pathlib.Path<a href="#A-better-pathlib.Path"> </a></h2><p>When you see <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">these extensions</a> to pathlib.path you won't ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Path.readlines</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.readlines()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.read</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.read()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.save</code>: saves file as pickle</li>
<li><code>Path.load</code>: loads pickle file</li>
<li><code>Path.ls</code>: shows the contents of the path as a list. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">Read more about this here</a>.  Here is a demonstration of <code>ls</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Wait!  What's going on here?  We just imported <code>pathlib.Path</code> - why are we getting this new functionality?  Thats because we imported the <code>fastcore.foundation</code> module, which patches this module via the <code>@patch</code> decorator discussed earlier.  Just to drive the point home on why the <code>@patch</code> decorator is useful, I'll go ahead and add another method to <code>Path</code> right now:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>That is magical, right?  I know!  That's why I'm writing about it!</p>
</div>

<h2 id="An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas">An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas<a href="#An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas"> </a></h2><p><code>Self</code>, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object.  For example, let's create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can use <code>Self</code> in the same way:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Let's create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Notebook-Functions">Notebook Functions<a href="#Notebook-Functions"> </a></h2><p>These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List">A Drop-In Replacement For List<a href="#A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List"> </a></h2><p>You might be pretty happy with Python's <code>list</code>.  This is one of those situations that you don't know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you.  Enter <code>L</code>, a list like object with many extra goodies.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe <code>L</code> is to pretend that <code>list</code> and <code>numpy</code> had a pretty baby:</p>

September 4, 2020 | https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The above QR code contains a complete Windows executable that will run on Windows 7 and up. It's a simple but fully playable implementation of Snake.</p>
<p>A QR code is a data storage medium like any other, and while it's almost always used to store ASCII text, it can also be used to store binary data. As such, virtually any computer data can theoretically be stored in a QR code provided it can fit within the size limitations.</p>
<p>A QR code comes in various standard sizes, the largest being version 40 which can store up to 2,953 bytes (roughly 2.9 KB) of binary data. The above code is not quite that large, it's only storing around 1.4 KB of data (shrunk down from 3.2 KB with <a href="http://www.crinkler.net/" target="_blank">Crinkler</a>, slightly larger than the executable shown in the video because I decided to add a little more functionality).</p>

<p><b>Method 1: Webcam (automatic)</b></p>
<p>You can treat this QR code much like a QR code in the real world by using your computer's webcam to read it (e.g. after loading this page on a phone or printing the QR code out). For this, I recommend using zbarcam. I've included a download link with everything you need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open "Read Snake From QR.bat". After a moment, your webcam will activate.</li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and Snake will appear, freshly read from the QR code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Method 2: Webcam (manual)</b></p>
<p>This method is the same as the above, however if you'd rather input the commands manually than running my script, go for it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
    <li><span>cd</span> to the zbarcam folder.</li>
    <li>Run the following command:
        <p>zbarcam --raw --oneshot -Sbinary &gt; snake.exe</p>
        <p>The arguments used are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>--raw</span> - Disables any character encoding conversion.</li>
            <li><span>--oneshot</span> - Stops reading and closes zbarcam after the code has been successfully read.</li>
            <li><span>-Sbinary</span> - Informs zbarcam that the data in the code is binary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and an executable called "snake.exe" will appear in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open "snake.exe".</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been patched to correctly output binary data on Windows. This project exposed a bug in zbarcam where binary data was incorrectly treated as text, inadvertently corrupting it as Windows attempted to convert LF line endings to CRLF. The fix used here has since been merged into zbar's master source code, but as of July 2020 no stable release version has included the fix yet.</li>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been compiled with DirectShow support for greater compatibility with webcam devices. In my video, I use a build that has not been compiled for DirectShow (using VfW instead) which leads to a black and white webcam feed. This build provides a feed in color.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote an implementation of Snake in JavaScript that, when minified, could also fit into the maximum QR code size which I briefly showcased in the video. Some people were interested in playing this, so <a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/snake-minified.html">it is available here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h3 id="if-not-please-continue-reading"><strong>If not please continue reading. 😊</strong></h3>
<p>My first introduction to programming was with the programming langauge Java, and one of the concepts of programming with Java was Object Oriented Programming (OOP). For short, this concept <strong>encourages developers to code</strong> their software in a way that tries <strong>to model real life objects</strong>, so that </p>
<ul>
<li>Different components of your software can be represented well and</li>
<li>Features of similar concerns can be grouped together.</li>
</ul>
<p>To read more on this concept check out <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS">here</a></p>
<p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm langauge, meaning it does not enforce any programming concepts unlike langauges like Java. This is not neccesarily a bad thing, it just means we can incoporate some Object Oriented Programming goodness into writing our JavaScript code. </p>
<p><strong>In this write up we would be practicing this while creating a Student Registry Form.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We would be using ES6 classes to demonstrate our example. JavaScript ES5 has a different approach using prototypes, but I find ES6 classes simpler and easier to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I move to the implementation we should look at the meaning of some keywords in object oriented programming. </p>
<h2 id="instantiating-classes">Instantiating classes</h2>
<p>In the OOP world when a class is Instantiated it means an object with unique/shared properties has been created. <strong>So for example </strong></p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> {}




<span>const</span> student1 = <span>new</span> Student();


</code></pre><h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>These encapsulate the properties you would like to create every object with, and <strong>in JavaScript we do it like so</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> Student {
    <span>constructor</span>(<span>name, email, address, course</span>){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }
}



<span>const</span> student1 = <span>new</span> Student(<span>'Tayo'</span>, <span>'tayo@gmail.com'</span>, <span>'56 Mongromery House m7 780'</span>, <span>'Social Science'</span>);
<span>const</span> student2 = <span>new</span> Student(<span>'Peter'</span>, <span>'peter@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'12 Grunt Road m6 100'</span>, <span>'Nursing'</span>);

<span>console</span>.log(student1)
<span>console</span>.log(student2)


</code></pre><h2 id="methods-in-classes">Methods in classes</h2>
<p>Classes can also contain methods that can be called on each object after intialisation. <strong>For example</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address, course){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }

    getName(){
        <span>return</span> `Student name <span>is</span> ${<span>this</span>.name}`
    }
}

<span>const</span> student2 = new Student(<span>'Peter'</span>, <span>'peter@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'12 Grunt Road m6 100'</span>, <span>'Nursing'</span>);

console.log(student2.getName()) 
</code></pre><h2 id="inheritance-extending-classes">Inheritance/ Extending classes</h2>
<p>Class inheritance is a common code practice where we have a super class that has similar properties or methods to its children classes, and then the children classes copy from their parent class. The child class can further extend its class functionality if need be. </p>
<p>Its just a neat way of making sure we are not repeating similar properties between multiple classes. Assuming that our class Student extends a parent class of Person. So we know a person can have a name, age and address but they might not have a course because they might not be students. <strong>We represent this like so</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address){
        <span>this</span>.name = name;
        <span>this</span>.email = email;
        <span>this</span>.address = address;
    }

    getName(){
        <span>return</span> `Student name <span>is</span> ${<span>this</span>.name}`
    }
}

<span><span>class</span> <span>Student</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Person</span> </span>{
    <span>constructor</span>(name, email, address, course){
                <span>super</span>(name, email, address);
                <span>this</span>.course = course;
    }
}

    <span>const</span> student2 = new Student(<span>'Hannah'</span>, <span>'hannah@hotmail.com'</span>, <span>'1 Medley m3 493'</span>, <span>'Economics'</span>);

console.log(student2.getName()) 
</code></pre><p>Inheritance allows the children objects to inherit all its parents properties and methods. In this case the Student class has inherited the propertied form name, age and address as well as method getName(). You can also add more methods or properties to the Student class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Student can access properties from Person but not the other way round.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="practical-example-oop-practice-using-javascript">Practical Example - OOP Practice using JavaScript</h2>
<p>Remember I said with OOP we try to represent things as objects, and those objects normally have functions, properties etc that represents the object's functionality? So in this case we would have two objects to build the <strong>Student Registry app</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Student Object  - Which stores data about the student information like name, email, address etc</li>
<li>UI Object - This object will be responsible for handling any changes in the the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what our student registry form looks like and the class objects that represents the students and the ui</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599081166433/_GgmwA20h.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Here we have constructed a <strong>Student class</strong> which will take in the values from our form to be rendered in the table below the form. Lets take a look at how we would do this using classes in JavaScript</p>
<pre><code>
<span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-form'</span>).addEventListener(<span>'submit'</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>e</span>)</span>{

    <span>const</span> name = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'name'</span>).value;
          email = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'email'</span>).value;
          address = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'address'</span>).value;
          course = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'course'</span>).value;

    
    <span>const</span> student = <span>new</span> Student(name, email, address, course);

    
    <span>const</span> ui = <span>new</span> UI();

    
    <span>if</span>(name === <span>''</span> || email === <span>''</span> || address === <span>''</span> || course === <span>''</span>){
        ui.showAlert(<span>'Please fill in all fields'</span>, <span>'error'</span>)
    }<span>else</span>{
        ui.addStudentToList(student);
        ui.clearFields();
        ui.showAlert(<span>"Student added"</span>, <span>"success"</span>)
    }

    e.preventDefault();
})
</code></pre><p>In the code above we have - </p>
<ul>
<li>Added an event listener to the form for student registry</li>
<li>Once the form is submitted we would like to store the input values for name, email, address and course in variables as shown.</li>
<li>Once the values are retrieve we can then <strong>instantiate</strong> our student class with the values.</li>
<li>We also <strong>initialised</strong> our UI class</li>
<li>The instance of the UI class we created allows us to call some of its functionality like <strong>showAlert, addStudentToList and clearFields.</strong></li>
<li>If the input fields are empty an appropriate ui function is called, else if everything is valid then we can add the student to the list, clear the input fields and show a success alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets look at the implementation for these methods</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>class</span> <span>UI</span> </span>{

    
    addStudentToList(student){

        <span>const</span> list = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-list'</span>);
        
        <span>const</span> row = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'tr'</span>);
        
        row.innerHTML = <span>`
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.name}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.email}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.address}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;<span>${student.course}</span>&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="#" class="delete"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        `</span>;

        list.appendChild(row);

    }

}
</code></pre><p>Our first method in the class is <strong>addStudentToList</strong> here we </p>
<ul>
<li>accept the student object as an argument</li>
<li>Select the table body element using <strong>getElementById</strong></li>
<li>Then create a tr element</li>
<li>Then we insert our HTML in the tr element we just created and then access each of the Student class properties we would like to display.</li>
<li>After this the row is appended to the table body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great we can add the second method of concern to our UI class which is the clearField method</p>
<pre><code>    clearFields(){
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'name'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'email'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'address'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
            <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'course'</span>).value = <span>''</span>;
    }

} 
</code></pre><p>This is a simple function that just sets the input field in the form to nothing once the form is submitted.</p>
<p>And finally the last <strong>showAlert</strong> which takes in two parameters the first one the alert message and the second argument is the name of the class.</p>
<pre><code>    showAlert(message, className){

            <span>const</span> div = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'div'</span>);
            div.className = <span>`alert <span>${className}</span>`</span>;
            div.appendChild(<span>document</span>.createTextNode(message));

            
            <span>const</span> container = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'.container'</span>);

            <span>const</span> form = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'student-form'</span>);

            container.insertBefore(div, form);
            setTimeout(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
                <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'.alert'</span>).remove();
            }, <span>3000</span>);

    }
} 
</code></pre><p><strong>In this function </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A div is created and classnames alert and the classname passed is added to it</li>
<li>A text node is created with the message passed</li>
<li>Both the container and the form is selected to guide where the alert message should be inserted</li>
<li>And in this case we want to insert the div we created just between the form and the container div.</li>
<li>After 3 seconds the alert bar is removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a brilliant way to write your code because it makes everything more resuable. Can you add a delete method to our ui class? Give it a shot. You would need knowledge on targetting elements to be deleted written <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.oshogunle.com/learning-javascript-topic-event-bubbling-and-delegation-cke03qfaw0003u0s17oppa0uz">here</a></p>
<p>To test our code so far the output looks like so. </p>

<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM.jpg" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM.jpg 699w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.48-AM-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></figure>



<p>Passenger cars and trucks have become rolling software updates, and while that has sped up product development cycles, it has created a big problem. A lot of the automotive industry has been updating software post vehicle sale through dealership recalls. As you can imagine, with dozens of systems using different software in a single car, that could become an issue. Enter remote software updates, an increasingly common strategy for mobility tech to integrate continuously improving software into vehicles that have already been set on the road. </p>



<p>Tesla was a pioneer in this field. In a way, a new EV startup was the perfect place for something like remote vehicle software updates to take off, because Tesla was building mostly from the ground up. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1024x430.png" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" width="269" height="113" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1024x430.png 1024w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-300x126.png 300w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-768x322.png 768w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1536x645.png 1536w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-2048x860.png 2048w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sibros-Logo-WhiteBackground-CMYK-1200x504.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px"></figure></div>



<p>Hemant Sikaria joined Tesla back in 2011 as a technical engineering lead, and helped build a large portion of the software update platform Tesla still uses. He also led the body and chassis teams. “There is a lot software that connects with the windows, trunk, key fob,” he explains. Sikaria was technical lead on the Model X as well, and worked with the Tesla team on the Model X self-opening front doors. But then, he had his non-Tesla personal vehicle called to the dealership several times within 3 months for a recall and software update, and realized that most of the automotive industry wasn’t using the Tesla method of OTA or “over the air” software updates. “I got the startup itch,” Sikaria says, and he started tech startup <a href="https://www.sibros.tech/">Sibros</a> in 2018 to bring OTA software updates to the rest of the automotive industry.</p>



<p>It’s not so easy to be accepted into a gigantic, established, closed-door industry like automotive, much less integrate rapidly changing software technology with a years-long vehicle product development cycle. But the background in automotive at Tesla made all the difference in “knowing the pain points,” Sikaria says. Sibros partnered with an open-source security company in Silicon Valley to create a system with multiple layers of security for vehicle data collection and software updates. </p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM.jpg" alt="Sibros, Hemant Sikaria, OTA vehicle software updates, vehicle data security, Tesla, open-source vehicle security, remote vehicle software updates" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM.jpg 670w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.09-AM-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></figure>



<p>“We focused on building the core platform that every automaker will need,” Sikaria says when asked how one untangles the problem of integrating with so many diverse legacy software systems developed by automakers. The Sibros system can perform software updates for the full vehicle–up to 80 microcontrollers–for a full deep update of the vehicle. This can be the difference between a vehicle needing to be brought into the dealership to improve its self-driving algorithms for improved safety versus having them delivered to the car in real-time with no inconvenience. There are multiple ways vehicles require these updates these days, from infotainment map updates to hardware functions in the vehicle. “We have the fastest integration on the vehicle side–6 days,” Sikaria says. He says when he tried to explain that to automotive industry folks, they didn’t believe it was possible to do in under a month. “We developed our system in a modular way to integrate with vehicle hardware and back-end systems,” Sikaria explains. “It’s configurable for different networks and hardware architecture.” </p>



<p>Sikaria says the biggest change he’s seeing in mobility tech right now is that people are taking connectivity in vehicles more seriously. “COVID accelerated the use of remote diagnostics, telemetry, and software updates,” he explains. “We’re seeing interest in our remote systems in Germany, the U.S., China, and Japan.” </p>



<figure><img src="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM.jpg 670w, https://cronicle.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-04-at-7.53.31-AM-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"></figure>



<p>As any Detroit automotive engineer or entrepreneur can tell you, this is not all as easy as Sikaria is making it sound. Legacy culture as well as software at automakers can create lags in production cycles that create problems for software development and updates integrating with other systems as software technology changes practically by the day, though the situation is improving. We asked Sikaria if he has any advice for entrepreneurs breaking into mobility tech. “Anybody looking to solve problems first needs to understand ‘what are the real problems?'” he says. “Test all assumptions. What are your top 3-5 assumptions on which you’re basing your new company? And test those assumptions before you do much product build.”</p>



<p>Also, Sikaria says that industry experience is invaluable. “If folks have a chance to work in the industry before starting their entrepreneurial journey, that gives you first-hand experience of reality versus what media are saying the state of the industry is,” Sikaria says. A smaller mobility company like <a href="https://cronicle.press/2020/03/06/may-mobility-the-autonomous-transportation-revolution/">May Mobility</a>, Sikaria says, or new startup Rivian, would be a good place to gain a lot of experience and wear many hats quickly to get up to speed on the industry. </p>

<p>It’s difficult for entrepreneurs whether they’re in the hardware or software space in mobility, Sikaria says. “Hardware startups need to raise a lot of money,” he says. “Software is easier from a financial perspective but competitive because the barrier to entry is lower. Software in automotive is hard to do without an automotive background. At Sibros we knew the technology, use cases, pain points. That could be difficult without an automotive background.” </p>



<p>And the biggest problem? No surprise here: awareness. “This is a product everybody needs,” Sikaria says, “but it can be hard to find the right people to connect with and socialize the idea.” </p>



<p>As product development cycles in automotive shrink and software rollouts become a continuous rollout, we’re hoping to hear more good news from Detroit and from Silicon Valley tech companies making this a smoother process for both engineers and end consumers. No doubt it is a fascinatingly complex process, and any company making it easier deserves some credit for the sheer complexity of what they’re making seamless in your car. </p>

                <p>I'm stepping down from Rust's core team. It's my last official involvement with Rust, and I'm kinda sad about leaving. Rust is exciting and important, and I love the community and technology. It has been a joy and an education to work with the core team; they are good people.</p><p>I stopped working full-time on Rust early in 2019 when I left Mozilla. I have been contributing as part of my work at PingCAP (big thank you for that support!) and in my own time, but have had much less time for the work than it deserves. My wife and I are expecting a second daughter any day now, and I think that will nuke my remaining spare time, and any availability I have left for Rust work. Good timing for me to make space on the core team, and to focus on my databases/distributed systems work.</p><p>I hope to remain active in the community, and hopefully next year, once things have settled down a bit at home, I can again contribute regularly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/content/images/2020/09/99312bc3-a432-415b-8366-9ad1eefd47bb.JPG" alt="Ultrasound image of my daughter"><figcaption>My next project, pre-launch</figcaption></figure>

<p>When we talk about container runtime, we immediately think about Docker. Docker was the original container runtime; at the very least, it was the runtime that triggered the cloud boom that we are experiencing today. Docker allows virtualization to be far more robust and scalable by running containers and freeing developers from conventional cloud infrastructure limitations.</p>



<p>Docker also allows for the entire cloud architecture to be managed in a seamless way. It automates a lot of things about deploying cloud-native applications, from configuring the shared operating system components to making it straightforward for developers to package applications with all of its dependencies and libraries for smooth and universal deployment.</p>



<p>Docker, however, is a container runtime, which means it is complex by nature. To stay true to its mission to simplify cloud architecture management, Docker started separating components and functions. Containerd was introduced in Docker 1.11, and the container runtime⁠—or container tool, to be precise—has now matured to stand on its own.</p>



<h2>Getting to Know Containerd</h2>



<p>As mentioned before, Containerd started life as a tool that is a part of the Docker open source project. Containerd works really well with components such Kubelet. In fact, Containerd handles image management and worked alongside runc to construct the container runtime that we are so used to using.</p>



<p>Containerd, however, has graduated into its own high-level container runtime. On February 28, 2019, Containerd graduated as a project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which placed this tool alongside Kubernetes, CoreDNS, and Prometheus. The support of thousands of developers behind Containerd made it possible.</p>



<p>As a high-level container runtime, Containerd no longer requires Docker to run properly. It can now run on its own, with runc being its low-level container runtime. When used to deploy and manage Kubernetes, you can see Containerd as replacing Docker and Docker-shim with CRI-Containerd. Containerd has a few tricks up its sleeve too.</p>



<p>For starters, the high-level runtime is compatible with other low-level runtimes. You are not limited to using runc as your container runtime. You can also opt for tools such as kata-runtime to run containers. Containerd even supports running multiple container runtimes within the same environment.</p>



<p>Containerd works with both Linux and Windows and can handle on-premise and cloud hardware without a problem. Since Containerd completely abstracts syscalls or OS specific functionality, it is the perfect solution for running containers on top of any OSes it supports. Everything, from service discovery to netlink calls, is made simple.</p>



<h2>What Makes Containerd Different</h2>



<p>To really understand how Containerd has become an efficient tool and a capable container runtime that it is, we have to compare it against Docker. While Docker offers additional features through multiple components, Containerd is now a tool that specializes in three things: running images in containers, pushing and pulling images to the registry, and managing the images themselves.</p>



<p>Docker, on the other hand, handles building images and creating volumes. It also takes care of network plugins and overlay networks. Containerd simply abstracts all of those functionalities away, resulting in a very simple container runtime that gets you to the state that you want faster.</p>



<p>Containerd does offer some advantages. Since containers are almost entirely independent, you can upgrade and reboot the Docker daemon without restarting containers or bringing them down. The API offered by Containerd also makes managing the environment using Containerd a lot easier. You basically have control over everything through API calls.</p>



<p>Not having to work with syscalls is a benefit of its own. Also, the presence of runc is so that Containerd can still run Linux commands and processes, mainly for the purpose of supporting the containers running on top of it.</p>



<h2>Complete Container Lifecycle Management</h2>



<p>OCI image spec support and OCI runtime spec support⁠—apparent from the use of runc⁠—both make Containerd straightforward to work with. You know immediately that you can manage the lifecycle of containers from end to end without having to integrate additional tools or gain access to features you don’t really need.</p>



<p>Support for image push and pull is a useful tool. Everything you can do with Containerd can be done in a simple way. For, example, pulling an image is a simple cli&nbsp;“$ ctr image pull”. </p>



<p>There are plenty of ways to optimize your use of Containerd too, starting with making sure that a minimalist host operating system is in use. Containerd doesn’t add bulk to the underlying operating system⁠—since it runs as a daemon⁠—but you can boost the performance of the overall cloud environment by optimizing the ecosystem from the ground up.</p>



<p>Your choice of container runtime (low-level) is also important. Runc runs containers for you by default, but there are other container runtimes to choose from. With the client layer supporting Docker or Kubernetes, you will never have to go into kernel details. With Kubernetes specifically, Containerd can also be used as CRI runtime.</p>



<p>What must not be forgotten is the additional projects that can enhance Containerd and the environment it supports further. Containerd has a distribution controller, bundle controller, and runtime controller. </p>



<p>It is clear that Containerd is set up this way so the tool can offer maximum scalability without making running apps and microservices in containers too complicated.</p>

			<h4><em>Dean Scarff</em> on bringing AI to climbing grades</h4>



<p>It’s some time in The Future; the bushfire smoke has cleared, you’re out of coronavirus lockdown and you’re psyched to finally climb outdoors again. Flicking through the guidebook you spot it; a climb that’s at your grade, and it’s even got two stars. The onsight awaits.</p>



<p>Several hours later you’re thrutching up a section of the route that feels like it must be at least two grades harder than what the guidebook claimed. The only hope for your ego is that you’re collateral damage from a 1970s interstate sandbagging contest. If only you could have stumbled on a recently-bolted softie that climbs like a gym route instead!</p>



<p>In Australia we’re blessed with the best grading system in the world courtesy of the legendary John Ewbank.&nbsp; Ewbank used whole number grades, which took into account a range of factors. These numbers put climbs in order: you can expect a grade 20 will be harder than a grade 19, and so on.</p>



<p>Yet even with this system, we rely on the opinions of first ascensionists and guidebook editors for fair grading. These opinions can be warped by grade inflation, quirky styles and intentional sandbagging. Another problem arises when trying to do maths with grade numbers. Normally we can add 1 to a whole number to get the next whole number, but there’s nothing consistent and measurable that’s equivalent to adding 1 to the grade of a route.</p>



<p>What if there was a way to quantify which routes were soft or sandbagged, some measure that reflected the experience of many climbers? Well, obviously you’d use it to find something soft to tick and impress your friends, right?!</p>



<h3><strong>FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine you’re seeking glory and wander into an unfamiliar crag without a guidebook. Your mate, who can redpoint most 19s but has been working several grade 21 projects for months, proceeds to flash a route.&nbsp; You guess it’s grade 19 or lower. If your mate dogged it instead, you might guess it’s above grade 19. The more climbers of different skill levels trying the route, the more information you have to pinpoint the grade.</p>



<p>But what if you don’t know how hard everyone else climbs to start with?&nbsp; That’s fine, you can watch for climbers who are taking roughly the same number of attempts as you to send particular routes. When it’s your turn on the next route, you can guess that you’ll take the same number of attempts as they did.</p>



<p>This is the basis for a scientific grading system. Instead of using people’s opinions about how hard routes are, you observe the actual outcomes of the ascents. To put a single number on how difficult a climb is, you can use the odds that you’ll send it.</p>



<h3><strong>THE CHESS GAME</strong></h3>



<p>Last year, on weekends I couldn’t climb, I investigated how far I could take these ideas. I drew inspiration from what may seem like a surprising source: the world of boardgame player ratings. Games like chess have ratings systems for ranking professional players, and I figured this could be applied to climbing.</p>



<p>These ratings systems are grounded in probability theory: the current ratings of two players can be used to calculate odds on the outcome of a game. The difference in ratings can be transformed to a probability using the ‘logistic function’, an S-shaped curve. If players have the same rating (0 difference), the odds are even. As the difference between the players’ ratings gets bigger, the probability the favourite wins gets closer to 100%. These systems allow for the ratings to be adjusted: after a game, the winner’s rating is adjusted up, and the loser’s rating is adjusted down.</p>

<p>I applied the same function for climbing. Every ascent is like a chess game, but one of the players is the rock itself. We can also make some other assumptions: it’s unlikely that climbers make big improvements overnight, and the longer it’s been since a climber has logged any climbing, the less certain we can be about their current performance level. All these statements about ‘what’s likely’ can be combined into a single statistical model. Based on this model, I built software that picks the best climber and route ratings to fit with a list of ticks.</p>



<p>All I needed now was data. To start with I just used my friends’ logbooks, which let me sanity-check the software I’d written. But with so many routes, the model needed more data to narrow down grades. So I made contact with <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="theCrag.com (opens in a new tab)">theCrag.com</a>, an online guidebook and logbook website. The team from theCrag gave me access to the hundreds of thousands of ascents records available from the platform, which I used to validate and refine the model.</p>



<p>We were stoked with the results of running theCrag’s users’ logbooks through my program. In most cases, the estimated grades are similar to guidebook grades, so the model is able to calculate a reasonable grade without anyone’s opinion as input. It’s also good at putting odds on clean ascents: adding 1 to a grade has a real meaning in terms of the odds someone can send a route. These are the theoretical improvements over conventional grading.</p>



<p>However, the real gold is where the model results and the guidebook disagree. For some routes, particularly rarely repeated ones, this seems to be due to a lack of data: the clean first ascent belies many hours of working a project. But in many cases climbers’ online accusations of soft or sandbagged grading were agreeing with the model. I’d found what I’d been looking for, and soon enough my friends were asking for recommendations of soft routes at the next grade.</p>



<p>There are still many opportunities for improvement. How good the estimated grades are depends a lot on the ascent data. Picking the right grades relies on climbers logging all their ascents online, even their hangdogs. And there are lots of other factors that are currently left out of the model to keep it simple, such as the effect of particular styles, reachy moves, knowing the beta and broken holds.</p>



<p>For me, working on this project was an opportunity to combine two of my hobbies (climbing and programming), while also making something for the climbing community. I’ve made the open source estimation software available for <a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">fr</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="e (opens in a new tab)">e</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">e</a>, and I’ve also published an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">academic paper</a> detailing the theory and performance of the model. I’m also very grateful for the willingness of Simon Dale and his team at theCrag.com to work together.</p>



<p>As for the revised grades, a first version of them <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">has been</a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="  (opens in a new tab)"> </a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">incorporated into route listings on theCrag.com</a> – you can see it listed amongst the Grade Citations under the name grAId (a play on the word ‘grade’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’). </p>

  <section>
  

  

  <p><em>This article is part of an ongoing “<a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/posts/category-disassembling-links-awakening">Disassembling Link’s Awakening</a>” series, where I attempt to gain some understanding on how special effects were implemented in this game.</em></p>

<p>The Game Boy, as most gaming platforms at the time, uses tiles for graphics rendering. Instead of drawing individual pixels on the screens, games must first provide <em>tiles</em> (small graphics fragments, usually 8x8 pixels wide), and then combine together this limited number of tiles to draw pictures on the screen.</p>

<p>This technical limitation influences not only the games appearance, but also the gameplay. This articles goes in-depth into a specific example: how the design of Zelda: Link’s Awakening overworld map is influenced by the underlying tile-based rendering.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-of-tiles-based-rendering">Challenges of tiles-based rendering</h2>

<p>To display an image on screen, as all tile-based games, the game engine must first copy the required tiles to the Game Boy <abbr title="Video memory">VRAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>This brings two challenges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of tiles that can fit into VRAM at a given time is extremely limited,</li>
  <li>Changing the tiles stored in VRAM is slow, and can only be done at specific times.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>
<a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld_2.dmg.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld_2.dmg.png" alt="The tileset of Link's Awakening Overworld"></a>
<br>
<em>A part of the tileset used on the Overworld.<br>
This is way to big to fit all in memory at once, so only parts of it can be loaded at a time.</em>
</span></p>

<p>So in order to display graphics efficiently, great care must be given to the <strong>ressource-management of tiles</strong>.</p>

<p>A modern game engine would probably include a ressource-management system, which would ensure that, for each frame, the tiles required to display the objects on the screen are properly loaded. But the code for such a system would be quite complex: as uploading tiles takes a lot of time, it would have to predict which objects are going to appear on screen. The system would also have to ensure that not too many different objects are going to be visible on screen at once–otherwise there’s no space left in VRAM to upload the required tiles.</p>

<p>But on older hardware, such as the Game Boy, VRAM is so limited that every single tile must be put to use. There’s no margin left for predictive loading or fancy resource-management systems.</p>

<p>Instead, older games generally use <strong>tilesets</strong>. Tilesets are some fixed sets of tiles that are grouped together, and known to be predictable available at a given time. The game designers typically give each scene its own tileset, and then use a tile editor to draw the rendered frame. And the tilesets can be switched when the game transitions from one scene to another.</p>

<p>As of Link’s Awakening, the code responsible for this ressource management has recently been documented. And this is exactly how the game manages tiles. The world map is divided into sections of 2x2 rooms. Each section has an associated tileset, which allows the map feature some variety between the different sections (because they can use different tilesets).</p>

<p>An array is not very telling. Let’s use a picture instead! And we’re lucky, because a few years ago, <a href="https://xkeeper.net/">Xkeeper</a> generated a map of the Overworld with the tileset IDs overlaid on each section.</p>

<p><a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Overworld map of Link's Awakening, with the tileset ID overlayed on each map section"></a>
<em>Each 2x2 section of the Overworld map declares its own tileset ID. (Credits: <a href="https://xkeeper.net/hacking/linksawakening/">Xkeeper</a>)</em></p>

<p>Quite simple – in theory.</p>

<h2 id="technical-constraints">Technical constraints</h2>

<p>Practically, it’s not so easy. As we know, in Link’s Awakening, when player moves from one room to another, the game animates the changes smoothly. Which means that during the transition, <strong>both the previous room and the next one are visible</strong>.</p>

<p>So during a room transition, both the old and new tileset need to be available in VRAM. Otherwise, glitches will ensue: if the tileset of the new room overlaps the tiles of the previous room, the previous room will shortly be rendered with incorrect tiles. Every time the game designers want to introduce new tiles, they have to think about the transitions from all the adjacent rooms. Moreover, this is hard to debug: the glitches could manifest only when visiting the rooms in a specific order.</p>

<p>Link’s Awakening engine has a solution for this: <strong>put structural constraints on the map design</strong> to avoid the issue almost entirely. Instead of testing every combination of rooms and tilesets, the game instead:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Defines a special “Keep current” tileset code,</li>
  <li>Ensures that the player always goes through a “Keep current” tileset before loading a new one.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “Keep current” tileset code is a special tileset ID, that instructs the game engine not to load any new tileset data for the current section of 2x2 rooms. You can spot it on the tilsets map above: it has a <code>0x0F</code> ID.</p>

<p>How does it solves our tileset issues? Well, a “Keep current” tileset is kind of a buffer zone between two different tilesets. A section with this tileset must be displayable using any of the tilesets of the section leading to it.</p>

<p>For instance, given the following map layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> ——————————      ——————————————     ———————————
| Section 1 |   |  Section 2   |   | Section 3 |
|           | ↔ |              | ↔ |           |
| Tileset A |   |"Keep current"|   | Tileset B |
 ———————————     ——————————————     ———————————
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this layout, depending on the player direction, the Section 2 tileset may be displayed either with Tileset A, or with Tileset B.</p>

<p>Which means that <strong>by design, a “Keep current” section can only use the tiles shared by the adjacent tilesets</strong>, in that case the Tilesets A and B. If this rule is not honored, the graphics of the “Keep current” section will be corrupted.</p>

<p>So by introducing some design constraints, the game avoids to ensure that every tileset has to be compatible with any tileset that could be adjacent to it. Now the game designers just have to ensure that some sections only use a restricted number of tiles shared between the adjacent tilesets. These “Keep current” sections will feature less unique details, but will ensure that transitions between different tilesets are always glitch-free.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains is to <strong>ensure that the player can never navigate directly from a tileset to another</strong> – but instead always goes through a “Keep current” area first.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, this reveals the hidden structure of Link’s Awakening Overworld map.</p>

<p>Here’s the same Overworld map than above, with the tilesets overlaid – but this time, the “Keep current” tilesets are highlighted in green.</p>

<p><a href="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-with-paths.png"><img src="https://kemenaran.winosx.com/images/zelda-links-awakening-overworld-map/overworld-tilesets-with-paths-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Overworld map of Link's Awakening, with the &quot;No change&quot; tileset overlaid in green"></a>
<em>Overworld map of Link’s Awakening. In green: the “Keep current tilesets. In red: walls and natural obstacles on the map.</em></p>

<p>As you can see, the game designers had to put restrictions to ensure that the player can never directly transition from a tileset to another – but instead goes through a “Keep current” tileset first.</p>

<p>How? <strong>By putting walls and obstacles on the map that separate the tilesets</strong>. These are the one highlighted in red on this map; the player can never go through them. The obstacles constraint the player’s path, and ensure the tilesets continuity.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="impact-on-game-design">Impact on game design</h2>

<p>Like all technical restrictions, limitations on tilesets are also a source of creativity.</p>

<p>Because of the “Keep current” buffer tilesets, it’s easier not to connect every section of the map to every other: obstacles must be built. But this constraint has upsides: <strong>it gives the map a labyrinthine structure</strong>. And that’s helpful for a good game design: it tends to divide the map into distinctly themed sections. Folds also make the world feel larger, like does a curated garden with carefully placed occluders.</p>

<p>The need to interleave buffer tilesets on the map also gives <strong>natural pacing</strong> to the game. Buffer tilesets can’t have the same visual complexity than other sections of the map (because they can only use a limited number of tiles). It makes simpler areas alternate with higher-complexity ones. As a result, the player will usually travel through a strongly-themed section, then a more generic one (as they move through a buffer tileset), then again reach another themed section. This sense of rhythm is a key element of a good game design.</p>

<p>As an addendum on to our four-part look at the general structures of the farming of cereal grains (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">IV</a>) this post is going to briefly discuss some of the key ways that the structures of <strong><em>rice</em> <em>farming </em></strong>differ from the structures of wheat and barley farming.  We’ll start with some of the key differences in the mechanics of rice farming itself, before moving into how those differences might motivate different social and economic organization in the countryside, before finally discussing some of the theories as to how rice farming might – or might not – impact larger structures like the state.</p>

<p>(Quick bibliographic aside: I relied primary for this on Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (206 B.C. – A.D. 220) (1980) and F. Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field.  The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p>



<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>



<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process.  There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice.  When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing.  Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat.  While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’  As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p>



<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high.  Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields.  Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p>

<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas;  one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest).  In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p>



<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common).  The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water.  Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive.  The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields.  Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p>



<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant.  That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two.  Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice.  While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm.  Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p>



<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>.  My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice.  But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p>



<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2>



<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside.  We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p>



<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive.  Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat.  Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1.  As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p>

Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>.  Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones.  Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water.  In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p>



<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p>



<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation.  So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land).  The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p>

<p>The medieval toilet or latrine, then called a privy or garderobe, was a primitive affair, but in a castle, one might find a little more comfort and certainly a great deal more design effort than had been invested elsewhere. Practicality, privacy, and efficient waste disposal were all considered and, even today, one of the most prominent and easily identifiable features of ruined medieval castles is the latrines which protrude from their exterior walls.</p>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>Medieval toilets, just as today, were often referred to by a euphemism, the most common being 'privy chamber', just 'privy' or 'garderobe'. Other names included the ‘draught’, ‘gong’, ‘siege-house’, ‘neccessarium’, and even ‘Golden Tower’. Garderobe later came to mean wardrobe in French, but its original meaning was likely just any small cupboard or room and, as space was at a premium in a castle, the toilets were never any bigger than absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Exteriors</h3>
<p>The toilets of a castle were usually built into the walls so that they projected out on corbels and any waste fell below and into the castle moat. Even better, waste went directly into a river as is the case of the latrines of one of the large stone halls at <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Chepstow_Castle/">Chepstow Castle</a> in Wales, built from the 11th century CE. Some castles, such as the 11th-century CE Corfe Castle in Dorset, England had latrine shafts emptying directly in the courtyard or bailey while still others hung conveniently over a cliff face, as at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, England, built in 1176-1777 CE.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;Coity&nbsp;Castle in Wales, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement.</p>
<p>The protruding shaft of masonry that made up the toilet was buttressed from below or might nestle in the junction between a tower and <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/wall/">wall</a>. Some waste shafts were short while others reached almost to the ground. In the latter case, that might prove a dangerous design feature if there were a siege of the castle. Indeed, besiegers used just such a latrine shaft in 1203-4 CE to gain entry to Chateau Gaillard on the River Seine in France, built by Richard I (r. 1189-99 CE) at the end of the 12th century CE. After the siege, to ensure no repeat of the trick, a masonry wall was built around the shaft exit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another design was to have tiers of toilets on the outside wall where the shafts all sent waste to the same collection point. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Dover_Castle/">Dover Castle</a>, built in the second half of the 11th century CE, had a cesspit at the base of one wall of the keep to collect waste from the toilets above. At Coity Castle in Wales, built in the 12th century CE, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement. The same arrangement was found at Langley Castle in Northumberland, England, built c. 1350 CE, with the common collection point being a pit which was cleaned out by a natural stream. There were also toilets in ground floor buildings and these had stone drainage channels to drain away waste. Waste from such collection points, or the ditch in general,&nbsp;was likely collected by local farmers to be reused as fertiliser. When castles became larger and more comfortable from the 14th century CE, so the number of conveniences increased. Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, England, for example, had no fewer than 28 toilets emptying out into its moat.</p>

<h3>Interiors</h3>
<p>Viewed from the interior, the toilet was set back in a recess or within a mural chamber (a passage within a wall) but not all were given the luxury of a wooden door. A short narrow passageway sometimes led to a toilet, often with a right-angle turn for greater privacy. Pairs of toilets, separated by a wall, were not uncommon and these might share the same waste chute. The chamber of the castle’s lord often had a private latrine but even he had, like everyone else, a chamber pot if needed. The castle’s priest might also be one of the lucky few to have an <em>en-suite</em> toilet for his own chamber, as at Northampton Castle, England, built in the late 11th century CE. Another sure place to find a castle toilet was in the corner of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Great_Hall/">Great Hall</a> where audiences and banquets were held.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The toilet seat was made of a wooden bench covering the shaft hole in the masonry. The wood was usually cut with a rectangular or keyhole aperture. Hay, grass, or even moss were used as toilet paper. Toilet hay is referred to by medieval writers, albeit indirectly. Jocelin de Brakelond, the 12th-century CE English monk, recounted the story that a fire had almost broken out in the Abbey of Bury St. Edmonds when a candle had burned dangerously close to the hay in one of the abbey’s privies.</p>
<p>Some toilets had a window to let in fresh air, which for the same reason was not shuttered like other windows of a castle. The floor may have been scattered with rushes and aromatic herbs and flowers, just as the Great Hall of the castle was, to deter vermin and offer a more pleasant fragrance than the users could provide. Walls were sometimes whitewashed with a coating of lime-plaster which maximised the light coming from the small window and because lime kills off bacteria.</p>

<p>The toilet was cleaned either by a simple bucket of water thrown down the shaft or by diverting the wastewater from the kitchen sinks. More rarely, rainwater was diverted from gutters above the latrine which might also be collected into a cistern and then periodically opened to flush the toilet shaft. Despite these&nbsp;refinements, there can be no doubt that a castle toilet stank to high heaven. Indeed, it was not uncommon to hang clothing near latrines as the pungent ammonia fumes helped to kill mites. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Henry_III_of_England/">Henry III of England</a> (r. 1216-1272 CE) famously made mention of the problem of unsavoury odours in a letter to one of his castle constables, ordering a no-expense-spared refit of the amenities of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Tower_of_London/">Tower of London</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the privy chamber…in London is situated in an undue and improper place, wherefore it smells badly, we command you on the faith and love by which you are bounden to us that you in no wise omit to cause another privy chamber to be made…in such more fitting and proper place that you may select there, even though it should cost a hundred pounds, so that it may be made before the feast of the Translation of Saint Edward, before we come thither. (Gies, 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Urinals</h3>
<p>Triangular urinals were built into some tower walls so that defenders did not have to leave their post for very long. An example is to be found in the mural passage at Orford Castle in Suffolk, England, built in the second half of the 12th century CE. It seems that even such basic human activities were considered by architects to provide the best possible defence of the castle against all comers in all situations. Intriguingly, at Castle Rising in Norfolk, England, built in the mid-12th century CE, there are two toilets next to each other but in separate rooms, one with a toilet and one with a urinal which might perhaps be evidence of a separation of the sexes.&nbsp;</p> </article><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>At Hashnode we have been experimenting a lot with blockchain and its use-cases. We have been running a developers’ community ourselves, and the idea behind “decentralized communities” fascinates me a lot. The fact that everyone owns the data and controls the platform can give rise to new types of social apps and disrupt the traditional way of building online communities.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a target="_blank" href="https://steemit.com/">Steemit</a> have proven that it’s possible to build such communities and reward users for their contributions. But how should someone go about replicating it and launching their own decentralized social platform powered by blockchain?</p>
<p>To answer the question, I took up the challenge of building a decentralized version of HackerNews.</p>
<p>During the process, I evaluated multiple platforms and finally zeroed in on a protocol called <a target="_blank" href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>. Using Tendermint, I have built a prototype called “Mint” which can serve as a boilerplate for building blockchain-powered social apps.</p>
<p>The codebase is on GitHub. You can check out the following links for code and demo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint">Mint Blockchain</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/Uphack">Website Code (Blockchain Front-end)</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="http://uphack.co/">Demo</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what does it take to build a blockchain-powered social community where the user-generated data is decentralized? If you are looking for an answer, you have come to the right place. Read on.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-observations">Preliminary Observations</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought of utilizing an existing platform to build the app. Smart Contract platforms like <strong>Ethereum</strong>, <strong>NEM</strong>, <strong>NEO</strong>, and so on offer storage of assets, but these are not designed to store large amount of data.</p>
<p>HyperLedger Fabric is compelling, but it’s designed to be deployed in private blockchain networks. Hashgraph sounds interesting, but it’s experimental as of now.</p>
<p>Other potential solutions were: <strong>Lisk Sidechains</strong>, <strong>Loom Network,</strong> and <strong>BigChainDB</strong>. The first two are in private alpha (invite-only), while BigChainDB is powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>.</p>
<p>So, instead of using BigChainDB, I decided to play around with Tendermint directly and see what was possible.</p>
<h2 id="why-tendermint">Why Tendermint</h2>
<p>Tendermint is a protocol that takes care of the consensus layer using BFT algorithm while you just focus on writing the business logic.</p>
<p>The beauty of the protocol is that you are literally free to choose any programming language to build an interface (Application Blockchain Interface or simply ABCI) that interacts with the blockchain.</p>
<p>Tendermint handles the most complex aspects of a blockchain such as block production rounds, peer to peer connectivity, gossiping about new blocks, transaction handling, and more. It stores the transactions on the disk using LevelDB and also delivers the confirmed transaction to your ABCI server so that you can create a global state out of it.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting? Let’s see how to create a blockchain app that stores data on chain using Tendermint.</p>
<h2 id="whats-needed">What’s Needed?</h2>
<p>Here is what you are going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Macbook / Ubuntu server</p>
</li>
<li><p>Golang</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint</p>
</li>
<li><p>MongoDB</p>
</li>
<li><p>And beer… (Coffee lovers can replace this with coffee)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-machine">Setting up the Machine</h2>
<p>Tendermint is written in <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. So, we need to install the Go language first. Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org/dl/">this link</a> to check out a few download options. If you are on Ubuntu, you can follow <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@patdhlk/how-to-install-go-1-9-1-on-ubuntu-16-04-ee64c073cd79">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>By default, Go chooses <code>$HOME/go</code> as your workspace. If you want to use a different location as your workspace, you can set <code>GOPATH</code> variable in <code>~/.profile</code> . From now on, we’ll refer to this location as <code>GOPATH</code>.</p>
<p>Here is how <code>~/.profile</code> file looks on my machine:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> GOPATH=<span>"<span>$HOME</span>/go"</span> 
<span>export</span> PATH=~/.yarn/bin:<span>$GOPATH</span>/bin:<span>$PATH</span>
<span>export</span> GOBIN=<span>"<span>$GOPATH</span>/bin"</span>
</code></pre><p>Remember to set <code>GOBIN</code> variable as shown above. This is where the Go binaries will be installed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to run source ~/.profile after updating the file.</strong></p>
<p>Now we can install Tendermint. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>cd $GOPATH/src/github.com</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>mkdir tendermint</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>cd tendermint</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>git clone [<span>https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint</span>](<span>https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint</span>)
</code></pre><p>This will install the latest version of Tendermint. As I have tested my code against <code>v0.19.7</code>, let’s check out the specific release.</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> <span>tendermint</span>
<span>git</span> <span>checkout</span> <span>v0</span><span>.19</span><span>.7</span>
</code></pre><p>This will put you on v0.19.7. To proceed with the installation, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code><span>make</span> get_tools 
<span>make</span> get_vendor_deps
<span>make</span> install
</code></pre><p>Congrats! You have installed Tendermint successfully. If everything was installed as intended, the command <code>tendermint version</code> will print out the Tendermint version.</p>
<p>Now, you should go ahead and install <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coding-the-blockchain">Coding the Blockchain</h2>
<p>If you want to understand how Tendermint works, go through <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599215400067/l5utsBotC.html#intro-to-abci">this guide</a>. You may also find the following diagram helpful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6668/1*JYygIBf5rs8ujW5C1TRlvA.png" alt="Source: [Tendermint Docs](http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/projects/tools/en/master/introduction.html)"><em>Source: <a target="_blank" href="http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/projects/tools/en/master/introduction.html">Tendermint Docs</a></em></p>
<p>I’ll outline a few important concepts here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tendermint core handles the consensus part.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You need to write an ABCI server that handles the business logic, validations, and so on. Although you can write this in any language, our language of choice will be Go.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint core will interact with your ABCI server via socket connections.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ABCI server has many methods (JS developers can think of them as callbacks) that will be invoked by Tendermint core on various events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two important methods are: <code>CheckTx</code> and <code>DeliverTx</code>. The first one is called to validate a transaction, while the latter is called when the <code>Tx</code> is confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>DeliverTx</code> helps you take necessary actions based on the confirmed transactions. In our case, we’ll use this to create and update our global state stored in MongoDB.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tendermint uses BFT consensus. This means more than 2/3 of the validators need to have consensus in order to commit a transaction. So, even if 1/3 of the validators go rogue, the blockchain will still work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a real world scenario (at least in a public deployment), you will most likely add some sort of consensus such as PoS (Proof of State) in addition to BFT consensus. In this case, we’ll just go ahead with simple BFT consensus. I’ll leave adding PoS up to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest that you clone the blockchain ABCI server (code-named <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint">mint</a>) from GitHub. But before we go ahead, we need to install a dependency management tool called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a>.</p>
<p>If you are on a Mac, you can just run <code>brew install dep</code> . For Ubuntu, run the following command.</p>
<pre><code><span>curl</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
</code></pre><p>Now you can clone the codebase of mint.</p>
<pre><code>cd $GOPATH/src
git clone [<span>https://github.com/Hashnode/mint</span>](<span>https://github.com/Hashnode/mint</span>)
cd mint
dep ensure
go install mint
</code></pre><p>Sweet! You have now installed mint, which is an ABCI server and works along with Tendermint core.</p>
<p>Now, let me walk you through the whole set-up and all the code.</p>
<h2 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h2>
<p>You can find the code (and entry point) on GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint/blob/master/mint.go">here</a>.</p>
<p>The entry point of the app is <code>mint.go</code> . The most important part of the file is the following section:</p>
<pre><code>app = jsonstore.NewJSONStoreApplication(db)
srv, err := server.NewServer(<span>"tcp://0.0.0.0:46658"</span>, <span>"socket"</span>, app) <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {  <span>return</span> err }
</code></pre><p>All the business logic, methods, and so on are defined in the package <code>jsonstore</code> . The above code simply creates a TCP server on port <code>46658</code> that accepts socket connections from Tendermint core.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <code>jsonstore</code>package.</p>
<h2 id="business-logic">Business Logic</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Hashnode/mint/blob/master/jsonstore/jsonstore.go">Here’s</a> the <code>jsonstore</code> repo.</p>
<p>Our ABCI server does two important things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Validates incoming transactions. If a transaction is invalid, it returns an error code and the transaction is rejected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once a transaction is committed (confirmed by &gt; 2/3 of the validators) and stored in LevelDB, the ABCI server updates its global state stored in MongoDB.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to use <a target="_blank" href="https://labix.org/mgo">mgo</a> for interacting with MongoDB. So, <code>jsonstore.go</code> defines 5 models that correspond to 5 different MongoDB collections.</p>
<p>The code looks like the following:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

Waves power into the coast, with an almighty force, whilst many surfers await, ready to make the most of the towering water as it breaks. Having spent a lot of my childhood in Cornwall and still returning to this day, I always take the chance to get out on the water.</p><p>Obviously waves are powerful things, but there is more to their power than meets the eyes and I wanted to explore their true power.</p><p>A wave breaks when it wants, it is as powerful as it wants, the wave couldn’t care less if you’re riding it or not. There is no controlling it. It’s just you responding and reacting to the wave. Your reaction is all you can control. This creates a connection, a relationship between you and the water. One that you are a part of, but just to observe and react, all you can do is do your best and the wave will do its own thing. This connection is natural and raw, just you and the elements, nothing else is interfering or interrupting.</p><p>This connection with what’s around you and the earth, as you are riding the wave to the shore, also forms with fellow surfers riding the wave. Enjoying that same moment and experience, unique in many ways.</p><p>Nothing else is in the way or is there to disturb or interrupt you, there is a indisputable focus on the present. As if time is slowing down, watching the colours, ripples and feeling the undercurrent, strength and force of the wave. Lots of this happens subconsciously but this focus on the present can be hard to replicate elsewhere.</p><p>Waves are continuous, if you miss one, another is on the horizon. If you mess it up, then you can try again on the next. You just do your best and keep at it. There is something liberating about the idea you can just try again the next day and that’s ok. No pressure, limit or finiteness.</p><p>The artistic nature of the waves swirling, building and crashing is beautiful to watch, especially up close. It’s as if the movement has emotion, yet is unaware and not caring of what’s in front. As if it has a mind of it’s own.</p><p>The true power of waves is more than just the force of the water then.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, <a href="https://www.mattswain.co.uk/newsletter">sign up to my newsletter </a>for more ideas,  thoughts and insights into thinking without limits. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_add(a in 0..1000i32, b in 0..1000i32) {
        let sum = add(a, b);
        assert!(sum &gt;= a);
        assert!(sum &gt;= b);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>

where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>
<figure>

<p>So for a while I had a scraper running, which, once a day, scraped housing prices from chosen regions in Germany.
I accumulated about 6 month of data until I stopped it, mainly because I didn’t feel like I’d ever properly utilise it.</p>
<p>I decided to at least show some of it.
This post is basically excerpts from a Jupyter notebook.
A link to the data can be found at the end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small side-note: The diagrams in this post are best viewed in day mode. Sorry, fellow night-moders🌑</p>

<p>The data was split into one newline delimited JSON per day.
So first, read it into a <code>DataFrame</code>.</p>

<p>The next step was to clean the data a bit, since it was quite messy (scraped directly out of HTML).
Let’s focus on the important bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the dimensions to group by will be time. So we format the <code>crawl_time</code> into <code>datetime</code>.</li>
<li><code>area_total</code> somtimes contains prices. Talk about messy, so we filter that</li>
<li><code>price_num</code> contains decimal signs, € signs and also ranges. We replace as much as we can, but ranges will be dropped altogether.</li>
<li><code>room_number</code> usually contains the rooms twice, so we regexp the first number.</li>

<p>Since I’m a data engineer, and much more about collection and providing data, than about analysing, I will do exactly what I do best and provide the data.
I packed it all into one JSON, instead of many, and compressed it with 7z.</p>

<p>If you do anything nice with it, feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/Milchdealer">twitter🧑‍💻</a>.</p>

<p>What did I learn?
First of all, I’m not much of a data scientist.
While I do have ideas of what else I could with the data, it does not really motivate me to keep on going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, one could split out prices by area, rooms, city center or suburbs, …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working with pandas also does not feel entirely intuiative to me, mostly because most of data wrangling I usually do between low-level languages and python.
And whenever I really do want to display some results, I fall back to tables and excel.
Which admittedly works fine for pretty much all my use-cases.
And although it’s nice to try out new things, sticking to what you love to do usually yields in more fun.
Especially for side projects!😃</p>
<p>So, look forward to that. Still, this might not be my last dip into dataframes, notebooks and plotting.</p>

			<p>This Blogpost will investigate the impact of different power management policies for SATA devices in Linux with regard to their power consumption as well as their performance impact.
Because after all, everyone likes to get more battery life for free, right?</p>
<p>We will briefly discuss the test setup, then take a look at several measurement results for both power and performance to at the end take a look how to leverage the found results in practice.</p>
<p>Overall, we will find that for SSDs the power management policies for SATA devices can make a significant difference in power consumption while having a negligible impact on performance at the same time.</p>

<p>On a modern linux machine, several modes for power management of a SATA drive are available.
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scsi/link_power_management_policy.txt">These are</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>max_performance</strong>: A disk is typically kept awake and running to get the best performance out of it. This is most indicative when thinking about spinning disks, as a spindown leads to inevitable significant latencies for the next access of the drive</li>
<li><strong>min_power</strong>: This mode prefers power saving over maximum performance. For spinning disks this for example implies spindowns to save power</li>
<li><strong>medium_power</strong>: A compromise between the aforementioned two.</li>
<li><strong>med_power_with_dipm</strong>: This mode configures the drive like <code>medium_power</code> does, but with additional Device Initiated Power Management. <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/830838/">It uses the same configuration the Intel IRST Windows driver uses to for drives</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The measurement was performed on laptops and their internal SSDs.
Due to availability to the author, the measurements were done with a <strong>Crucial M550</strong> and a <strong>Crucial MX500</strong>, both 1TB in size.
Measurements were taken with</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 5.3</li>
<li>no applications opened (except for the terminal with the benchmarking process)</li>
<li>screen turned off (only really relevant for power)</li>
<li>standard system daemons still running</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h2>
<p>The power consumption measurements were done using <a href="https://github.com/cherti/sata-power-consumption">this code</a>, to further reduce noise, wifi was disabled as well.
After the link power management policy was set, the system was let idling for 10 minutes to reduce any influences from other policies or activities from before.
Afterwards, power consumpiton was measured over 15 minutes via the <code>/sys</code>-API of the machine’s battery controller.
It was read every three seconds.</p>
<p>Three scenarios were tested for all available link power management policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>idle</strong>: no induced activity</li>
<li><strong>synchronous</strong>: activity right before reading the current power consumption</li>
<li><strong>asynchronous</strong>: activity in the middle of two power measurements</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire procedure was repeated for all combinations of available link power management policies and scenarios (so in total 12 times).</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>After setting the link power management policy and let the system idle to ensure measurements would not be influenced by past activity.
Idle time was chosen to be 15 minutes (slightly longer as for power, an additional precaution as the performance measurements were significantly shorter time-wise that the power measurements).
Performance was then measured using <code>fio</code> 3.16 with <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/sata-power-consumption/ssd-test.fio.txt">this preset</a> adapted from <a href="https://github.com/axboe/fio/blob/master/examples/ssd-test.fio">here</a> using <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/sata-power-consumption/measure_performance.txt">this script</a>.
As benchmarking is hard, the performance measurements are not intended to be an absolute statement of the drive’s performance, but rather intended as a ballpark measurement to get a feel for the performance impact of different link power management policies.</p>

<h2 id="performance-1">Performance</h2>
<p>The measurements for the MX500 were very consistent when repeatedly measured.
The measurements for the M550 were a bit flakey, so the fio-measurement on the M550 was performed three times and the performance characteristics shown are the respective medians over all three measurements for both throughput and latency.</p>

<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>Latency information was gathered as part of the <code>fio</code>-measurements for the different link power management policies.
The results (specifically <code>lat</code> in fio’s output) are denoted as <code>average +/- standard deviation</code> in microseconds to, again, get a ballpark estimate.</p>

<p>As the results clearly indicate, the power link management policy has a noticable impact on a computer’s power consumption, up to a third of its total under light load when we exclude the screen.
The newest mode <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> proves to be both among the lowest consuming ones for all modes for the tested SSD models and also very consistent in this, whereas other modes are either equal, systematically higher or highly dependent of the scenario at play (for example the <code>min_power</code> mode on the MX500).</p>
<p>The performance impact, both in latency and in throughput, was, however, somewhere between measurable and completely negligible, the highest impact could be seen in the throughput of the M550 where the data still implies <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> to be the preferred choice.</p>
<p>Beware that the results in this post are only applicable to SSDs.
HDDs might have significantly different performance and power characteristics due to spin-down and spin-up times and other factors.
Furthermore, the aforementioned results will likely apply for SSDs in general, but were obviously only tested on certain models.
Different models, especially from differend vendors, could have different characteristics.</p>

<p>If you want to check which policy is in place, you can take a look at the content of the files <code>/sys/class/scsi_host/host[0-9]/link_power_management_policy</code>, which indicate the applied policy or simply use</p>
<pre><code>cat /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy
</code></pre>
<p>to see the policies. After all, if you didn’t configure anything, they should all be the same, so you’ll see what’s configured no matter which disk it is.
To automatically set the desired policy, you can create a file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/disk-power.rules</code> containing:</p>
<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM=="scsi_host", KERNEL=="host*", ATTR{link_power_management_policy}="med_power_with_dipm"
</code></pre>
<p>that will set <code>med_power_with_dipm</code> for all SATA disks that will show up.
Alternatively, if you use <code>tlp</code>, you don’t have to do anything, because (at least in the default configuration) <code>tlp</code> does already take care of setting this policy, at least for the primary SATA disk.</p>

<h3 id="liteonit-lcs-256-256gb">Liteonit LCS-256, 256GB</h3>
<p>One additional dataset was donated from an additional SSD, specifically a <strong>Liteonit LCS-256</strong>, sized at 256GB.
Below you find the power measurements for this disk, the measurement procedure is roughly equal to the one outlined for Crucial’s MX500 and M550 above.
We see that, while the exact numbers vary, the power profiles behave very similar, specifically to the ones of the MX500, and our conclusions apply for this disk as well.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>03 Sep 2020</span></p><p>Benefits of a mono-repo, based on experience from working at Netflix, Blippar,
and Aurora.</p>

<p>The point of a company-wide monorepo is so that your fact-finding efforts at
development time require navigating a chain of code vs navigating a chain of
people.</p>

<p>Walking through code is much more self-reliant and fast, given you CAN still
talk to people and ask questions.</p>

<p>No matter how professional, responsible and courteous your developers are at
maintaining documentation and answering queries from other teams, there is still
a human cost for someone to reach out in person.</p>

<p>That cost comes in the forms of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Requests to access code.</li>
  <li>Unnecessary invites on the calendar.</li>
  <li>Queries about what’s deployed or not, relevant or not, deprecated or about to
be.</li>
  <li>Hunting for real-world examples of usage of code across the company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another clear benefit is to have a singular technological backbone for the whole
company (or large team). Here’s what that does:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Infrastructure cost gets consolidated, easier to reason about.</li>
  <li>Frontend and backend code become less defensive, and more open to broader
changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>And benefits aren’t just technological, but also organizational (thx @methodiva)</p>

<p>A monorepo inherently discourages code fiefdoms, and hits the sweet spot of
feeling ownership, where you feel ownership and responsibility for the whole
product, instead of your little castle in it.</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://dev.vamsirao.com/vs-code-extensions | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dev.vamsirao.com/vs-code-extensions">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p>20 years ago, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eksisozluk.com/" target="_blank">Eksisozluk</a> was founded in 1999 by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/esesci" target="_blank">Sedat (ssg) Kapanoglu</a>. At the time that it was built, it was unique online platform in terms of its format in Turkey. According to the founder, Eksisozluk idea came from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” which is written by Douglas Adams. The idea was an online dictionary where the people would contribute by defining any term or word they want to. Eksi sozluk’s (means “Sour dictionary”) motto was “Kutsal bilgi kaynağı” can be translated to “The holy source of the knowledge”. But that declaration actually was a humor. Because the main purpose of Eksisozluk was to having fun and socialize. Every definition of a word or term was called “entry”. Entries did not need to be correct. People could do irony or write incorrect things intentionally to have fun about words or terms if they want to. Entries completely depends on author’s way of thinking about terms and things. The main rule was “whatever you want to write, you have to define the term first, then you can continue to write as you wish.”  If we want to give a comparative example, you can think Eksisozluk as mixture of the reddit and the wikipedia but in plain text only. Eksisozluk was gaining popularity over the time since its start.</p>



<p>For its 20th anniversary, I decided to bring back the original Eksi Sozluk to the life to celebrate its 20th b-day. And you will able to experience the early version of Eksisozluk your own. If you want to do this now you can follow this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://sourtimes.oguzkartal.net/info.html" target="_blank">link</a>. But naturally it’s language is in Turkish only. Also I pushed this project’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/0ffffffffh/sozluk-cgi-revival" target="_blank">source code</a> to my github account.  So this article will be containing the journey about how I done it. </p>



<p>In February 2015, Eksisozluk founder had published the original source code of Eksisozluk. It was the very early sample of its source code. After couple of months, that source caught my interest. I was very curious about how Eksisozluk was looked at that time because I was a child and naturally I did not know anything about it. I didn’t even have a computer at that time. So I pulled the source from its github <a href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">repo</a>. The early version of Eksisozluk had written in Delphi to be running as a CGI application. The CGI was quite popular technology to build web applications at those times. Of course the CGI remains very ancient technology today’s standards. But the major Http servers are still supports the CGI applications. Even, they were brought some enhancements to it like Fast-CGI etc. To be able run the source I had to compile it. When I inspect the project file I saw that it was developed with the Delphi 4. I wanted to compile with same version of the Delphi compiler. So I compiled and tried for the first run. I ran it under Apache Http server (httpd) 2.0 and Windows 2000 as the OS. I did it because I wasn’t sure about possible compatibility issues.  (Later I tested the compiled executables under Windows 10  and these are worked without any compatibility issue)  </p>



<p>It was worked well except a small logic problem in it. I fixed and sent a pull request. So he (ssg) accepted my pull request gracefully. That was my first attempt to work with the original eksi sozluk code.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz.png 944w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz-300x222.png 300w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/soz-768x567.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>The initial version of the Ekşi Sözlük and its very first entry, “Pena”. It became very popular in its community.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After 3 years the time was going to a remarkable milestone for Ekşi Sözlük. And I decided to do something for it. I wanted to bring the experience as same as the Eksi Sozluk at that time to the people. This was also “for fun” job for me. So I started this. Before starting this project I set one rule to myself.</p>



<p><em><strong>Whatever I do, I will not change anything from the original source and the technology that it based on.</strong></em></p>



<p>Why? Because I want to let people to use early version of Eksisozluk as completely same as its original code and binaries. This project will be run on the same code as of 1999. Yeah that sounds quite fantastic but that brought a lot of things to overcome for me. However, I have to bring some “must have” features to Eksi Sozluk CGI on the fly. Such as pagination support. The original Eksi Sozluk hadn’t any pagination support. Whole topics and entries were placed on the same page. That’s inefficient way to operate today.  I have done it without changing any html file for sake of the originality.  Let’s begin to meeting the original eksi sozluk’s architecture. </p>



<h3>Everything was stored in a text file as plaintext.</h3>



<p>Did you surprised?  But It was fairly enough to operate the service at the time. Because the early Eksi Sozluk was known by quite limited amount of people. And the most of them, they were friends of each other. These friendships would have came from the real life or from common IRC channels etc. Remaining people were usually friend of those core users. I thought the active registered users were nothing more than 500 at that time. On the other hand, the internet access in turkey at the time was also rare and the internet users weren’t online oftenly. So request and entry addition rates were too low to handle. </p>



<p>The first Eksi sozluk was kept the records in a plain text file like a phone book. Each different type of record was placed in different text file.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8.png 450w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project8-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"><figcaption>The original architecture of the Eksi Sozluk</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The diagram above shows you the architecture simply.  Every user requests were caught by the Http server then passed to the corresponding process. Cgi processes are responsible to handle the raw request. </p>



<p>Eksi sozluk’s logic were separated into several processes to prevent the source become too complex. But it had common core routines (called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi/blob/master/common.pas" target="_blank">common.pas</a>) that shared across the processes. Whole records input and output operations were done by sequential file read and write operations. There were two major text files. First is, the dict.txt. Dict.txt was a text file that the entries was stored. Second was user.txt. User.txt was the file for the users information. Fun part about that, the people who were registered earlier, they were experienced faster eksi sozluk than others. Because their user authentication was done quick because of their records were at the beginning of the user.txt :) Of course that delay was in the scale of the milliseconds except user.txt with 10.000 records :P. It would be really pain in the ass if user.txt had thousands of records. The user records made by 3 lines. First line was for user name (Users were called as Suser means “Sozluk User” as far I know), Second was for password in plain text. Yes, but don’t judge. That approach was not too deadly sin at the time. The actual horrible thing is even today, some giant services still store the passwords in plaintext. Anyway, the third line was for e-mail addresses.  Every new record (users, entries etc) was marked with ~ (Tilde) character. That would have pointed to the beginning of the new record. Same thing also correct for dict.txt. In perspective for dict.txt, the first line was for baslik (means topic), the second was for Suser nickname, third was for entry addition date, and the fourth was for the entry.  The term “entry” was used as is. I don’t know why but there was an inverse situation about the terms. baslik (topic) was used as in Turkish, but the entires were called as “entry” (means “girdi” in Turkish) instead of it’s Turkish form. Probably the word “girdi” was not good to hear. Anyway, you can take a look to the original dict.txt content and it’s structure by clicking <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ssg/sozluk-cgi/blob/master/dict.txt" target="_blank">here</a> if you want. </p>



<h3>Bringing back this ancient system to this day.</h3>



<p>The original architecture is obsolete and  it’s almost impossible to operate correctly in today’s standards, technology, bandwidth and online internet user capacity.  Of course you can still run it for your own with just throwing executables and html files into httpd’s work directories but that’s all. But you have to still be aware to your modern browser’s behavior. If your modern browser send anything that the sozluk-cgi does not love, you may get unwanted results :)) </p>



<p>So what I had to do? First I had to eliminate the direct file I/O access to the files then redirect all read write operations to a modern backend. To achieve that, I had to intercept executable’s native File I/O APIs. Sozluk-cgi was used Delphi runtime I/O functions (Internal buffering, caching etc) but eventually they were reach to the Windows file I/O APIs such as (CreateFile, WriteFile, CloseFile etc). After that, these intercepted I/O calls should be analyzed and converted into correct request packets. To do that, I had to study on the Eksi sozluk CGI code. Because to be handle the native I/Os as a request I should know what write read sequences corresponds which type of request or operation. I will be detailed later about this process. After translation of the requests there should be a backend system to handle requests, a database server to be store data efficiently and even a in-memory cache solution to reduce database I/Os. I drew a sketch in my mind about the new architecture for this. And after job done, the system’s structure became this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93.png 800w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93-300x225.png 300w, https://www.oguzkartal.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/New-Project93-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>The new architecture of the sozluk-cgi</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, there is a hooking layer to make bridge between cgi processes and the backend. The bridge layer is supported by the translation layer which is translates native read write sequences into its simple transportation format. The bridge is a duplex data transfer path which is based on named pipe. Translated request packets are handled by the request handler. The request handler reads the formatted data and maps into corresponding managed work implementation. The datastore manager is responsible to data models I/O. Datastore works with the cache manager internally. It communicates with the SQL Server and the Cache Manager when it need. Cache Manager is a dealer between Memcached instance and the backend. Registration service is responsible for user registration. Do you know why that services also known as Edi? You don’t? Nop. I will tell on its …</p></div></div>

Your teammates will soon feel safe to apply TDD for legacy code.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/tdd-for-legacy-code-mountain.jpg" alt="Drawing of an alpinist in front of an insurmountable mountain 'Mt Legacy Code' with a flag 'TDD' at the top"></p>

<p>A few days ago, a former colleague told me his current team was reluctant to give TDD a chance. Here are the typical comments he heard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Adding a test in this old code is a three weeks task!”</p>

  <p>“All the tests we wrote in this code are mock-ridden, unmaintainable, and useless!”</p>

  <p>“How can we go tests first, when the code is already written?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have worked with teams dealing with legacy code, you must have heard similar complaints.</p>

<h2 id="the-barriers-to-tdd-for-legacy-code">The barriers to TDD for Legacy Code</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/chainlink.jpg" alt="Close up photograph of a chainlink. There are barriers to overcome when starting TDD for Legacy Code"></p>

<p>All these difficulties boil down to two root causes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s impossible to write tests before code that was already written.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Legacy code makes everything more complicated. In our case, it increases the learning curve of TDD for the team.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>To get a team dealing with legacy code to do TDD, you’ll need to address these two fundamental barriers.</p>

<p>One option could be to put more pressure on the team: “From now on, TDD is mandatory.” This strategy is not going to work for long. We want a sustainable pace, and the only way to get it is through regular learning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to coach the team to one effective technique to apply TDD in the legacy code context.</li>
  <li>The next step is to leverage this momentum to set up regular practice sessions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-straightforward-technique">A straightforward technique</h2>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/railway.jpg" alt="Photo of a straight railway. It's best to start TDD for Legacy Code with one straightforward but effective technique."></p>

<p>Here is, in my opinion, <strong>the most useful and straightforward TDD for legacy code technique</strong>. Let’s say you need to add a new feature:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Refactor the existing code to introduce an extension-point to host your new feature</li>
  <li>Implement your new feature using TDD. Make it compatible to your extension-point</li>
  <li>Once your new feature is ready, plug it in the legacy code through the extension-point</li>
  <li>Check that the whole thing is working. Use whatever test you have, either manual or automated</li>
  <li>If it’s not working as you expect, repeat the whole cycle (adapt extension point, TDD your new feature…)</li>
</ol>

<p>All this might sound very easy in theory. Unfortunately, it can get pretty complicated in practice! Before trying this in production code, it’s a good idea to practice and learn. Let’s see how to do that!</p>

<h2 id="the-gilded-rose-kata">The Gilded Rose Kata</h2>

<p>The gilded rose is a famous kata to practice refactoring techniques. I am going to use it to illustrate the above plan.</p>

<p>The gilded rose is an inventory management function. The goal of the kata is to manage a new kind of item: conjured items. Conjured items behave like standard items, except that they age twice as fast. You can check <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt">the full instructions on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into the code!</p>

<h3 id="refactoring-to-an-extension-point">Refactoring to an extension-point</h3>

<p><img src="http://philippe.bourgau.net/imgs/2020-08-24-initiate-your-team-to-tdd-for-legacy-code-with-the-gilded-rose-kata/plug.jpg" alt="Photo of a plug on a blueprint. An effective first step to start TDD for Legacy Code is to refactor legacy code to make it easy to inject new features"></p>

<p>The first step in our plan is to change the existing code before injecting our new feature. This step can be tricky as it touches the legacy code, and we don’t want to break anything. Here are a few principles to cut risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stick to the smallest possible change</li>
  <li>Use any validation technique you have at your disposal:
    <ul>
      <li>End to end tests</li>
      <li>Manual tests</li>
      <li>Integration tests</li>
      <li>Setting up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test">Golden Master test</a> for the occasion is also a smart move.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use many pairs of eyes. <strong>Refactoring in pair or mob will drastically reduce the risk for regression.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the gilded rose kata comes with a golden master test. It’s a test that “snapshots” the behavior of your code to let you refactor it. It’s temporary because a precise snapshot is unmaintainable. You can learn more about the golden master technique through this live refactoring.</p>

<p>The gilded rose kata uses the <a href="https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp">ApprovalTests.cpp</a> library to help us with Golden Master testing. All we need to do is to add a set of test combination to the existing test:</p>

<p>Now that we have a regression test, we are ready to change the existing code, so let’s try to add an extension point. One way to do this is to add an array of ‘item updaters’ that can take care of specific types of items.</p>

<h4 id="cppsrcgildedroseh"><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/cpp/src/GildedRose.h">cpp/src/GildedRose.h</a></h4>

<p>The first thing we’ll do is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an ItemUpdater abstract class</li>
  <li>Add a list of ItemUpdater objects to the GildedRose constructor</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span><span>ItemUpdater</span><span>();</span>

    <span>virtual</span> <span>bool</span> <span>handles</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>Item</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>(</span><span>Item</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>class</span> <span>GildedRose</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>items</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>shared_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>itemUpdaters</span><span>;</span>
    <span>GildedRose</span><span>(</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Item</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>items</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>shared_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>ItemUpdater</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>itemUpdaters</span><span>);</span>
    
    <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>();</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>updateQuality</span><span>(</span><span>Item</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll just need to adapt the constructor calls from the tests with an empty array of ItemUpdaters <code>{}</code>.</p>

<h4 id="cppsrcgildedrosecc"><a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/cpp/src/GildedRose.cc">cpp/src/GildedRose.cc</a></h4>

<p>In the implementation, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Store the ItemUpdater objects</li>
  <li>Extract an <code>updateQuality(Item&amp;)</code> method to handle a single item</li>
  <li>Delegate to an ItemUpdater that can handle a particular item</li>
</ul>

<p>It is now possible to inject an implementation for conjured items.</p>

<h3 id="code-conjured-items-with-tdd">Code conjured items with TDD</h3>

<p>The implementation of our extension point needs to deal with two aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declare that it will handle conjured items</li>
  <li>update quality and sellIn for a conjured item</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the implementation I came to using TDD</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>

    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Earlier this year, we contributed a driver for the Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) introduced with the Allwinner H6 SoCs in Linux,
that got merged in Linux 5.8. It felt like a good occasion to write
about what an IOMMU is, what it’s useful for and how it integrates into
Linux.</p>

<p>At the low-level, a CPU executes an infinite sequence of instructions,
some of them either reading or writing to an address in memory.
Depending on the system design, the hardware maps that address to the
main RAM of the system, or to a specific device. The set of all the
memory addresses than the CPU can access is the memory space.</p>
<p>In older or simpler designs, the CPU accesses directly the physical
location on the memory bus of a memory word or register, the physical
address. This simple design is still in use on some micro-controllers
today, but it introduces some issues related to security, and
reliability.</p>
<p>Indeed, that design doesn’t enforce any isolation between processes or
permission checks. This means that any process in the system has
read/write access to the entire memory in the system, including the
kernel and other applications. This could lead to a system-wide memory
corruption if a buggy application starts to write at some random place
in memory. And this is the ideal scenario: indeed, it also allowed any
process to snoop on any memory stored by another process or the kernel,
leading to potential sensitive information leaks if that process was
malicious.</p>
<p>To fix that issue, CPU designs introduced a hardware unit called the
Memory Management Unit (MMU) that intercepts all the memory accesses
done by the CPU once enabled and translates them. This mechanism allows
to have two distinct address spaces: the physical address space that we
talked about earlier, and a virtual address space that the CPU operates
on, the MMU being in charge of translating the virtual addresses into
physical addresses when the CPU access them.</p>
<p>The best part is that the kernel can change the virtual address space
anytime, so it actually uses one virtual address space per process (and
potentially one for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">kernel</a>). In
addition, the MMU also allows to set extra attributes to carry out
access control over memory ranges, allowing to change whether we want to
allow the associated process to read, write, or execute the data stored
in a particular range.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows the kernel to prevent any process to messing with
the memory of another process at the hardware level, almost entirely
closing the class of attacks we mentioned earlier, and enables
the operating system to provide more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_virtual_memory_management">optimizations</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">features</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it looks complete, there’s a limitation though: the MMU
translates the addresses used by the <strong>CPU</strong>. Yet, some devices can also
access memory directly without the CPU intervention using a feature
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>,
and since the CPU isn’t involved, the MMU isn’t either. This means that we’re
still vulnerable to the same class of issues than the one we described earlier
if we perform a misconfigured DMA operation or if an attacker
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">manages</a> to trick a device
into reading some other parts of the memory than the one it’s supposed
to access. As an example of such an attack, you can find an in-depth
article explaining how the Google Project Zero team was able to pull
this off on a Nexus 6 modem
<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To close that channel of attacks, system designers later integrated
IOMMUs, that fill pretty much the same needs and with the same features
than regular MMUs, but providing that translation and protection to
devices that perform DMA instead of the CPU. It’s not unusual to even
have several IOMMUs: the GPU almost always has its own, and then there
would be another one for the rest or a subset of the devices in the
system.</p>
<p>IOMMUs also allow to address a common issue where the device isn’t able
to access the entirety of the buffer for some reason. It mainly happens
either when the buffer it’s supposed to perform DMA on isn’t contiguous
in physical memory and is thus split between some chunks while the
device can solely perform DMA on a single chunk; or when the device
can’t access the buffer location in RAM due to some limitations. One
common limitation would be that devices can just access the lowest 4 GB
of the RAM (since it’s addressable on 32 bits), while the system might
have more than that. Either way, the way to deal with that situation is
to create a <em>bounce buffer</em>: a temporary buffer that the device can
access and where we’re going to copy the content of the original buffer
to so that the device can access it. There’s an obvious performance cost
to it though, since we could introduce a copy of the whole buffer before
the device can operate on it. Still, IOMMUs save the day once again
since you can basically create any mapping, both accommodating the
non-contiguous case by creating a mapping where the virtual buffer would
be contiguous, and using a virtual address that the device can access.</p>

<h2 id="the-iommu-framework">The IOMMU Framework</h2>
<p>Since an IOMMU is so useful, Linux gained support for IOMMUs using a
dedicated driver framework under <strong>drivers/iommu</strong>. That framework uses
three different concepts to enforce permissions as fine-grained as
possible for a given device: domains, groups, and devices.</p>
<p>A device is quite straightforward, it’s a device that can perform DMA
operations through our IOMMU, a domain is a representation of a virtual
address space and a group is a set of devices that the IOMMU can’t
isolate from each other. The framework then relies on functions to
manage those three concepts. As you can see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/iommu.h#n191">the operations that a driver can perform</a>,
all those functions are to manage the relationships between the devices,
groups and domains that the system is going to have, and manage each
individually (to create a mapping in a particular domain for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-dma-api">The DMA API</h2>
<p>The second part of the integration in Linux, once it knows how to
manage the various address spaces through the IOMMU framework and
drivers, is to allow the drivers for the devices that need to perform
DMA to use that IOMMU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of Linux is to be as portable as possible, and it
does so by abstracting much of the usual driver operations through
frameworks and APIs, and allows to decouple the driver itself (how does
one need to program a device to perform a given operation) from how the
platform works (in our case, how would the platform do DMA, or how
should Linux configure the IOMMU).</p>
<p>DMA is no different here, and Linux has two distinct APIs depending on
the context: the streaming API and the coherent API. As we mentioned
earlier, you would use one over the other depending on the situation
you’re in, and who is in charge of allocating the buffer that gets
accessed through DMA. If the user-space hands the buffer to the driver
(for example when you would send a network packet, or write to a file),
you’d need to setup a temporary mapping through the streaming API. In
other situations though, the kernel would be in charge of allocating the
buffer and then pass that buffer to the user-space—the Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) and Video4Linux2 (v4l2) can operate like that—, and that
would be where you’d need the coherent API.</p>
<p>The two APIs are here to make sure that the device can perform DMA on
the buffer we want to access. They thus make sure that the device can
access the buffer. What it actually means then depends on the platform,
what memory range the device can access, which memory allocator to use,
etc. Part of that decision involves whether the device accesses go
through an IOMMU, which then gets configured properly to create the
mappings for our buffer in the device’s virtual address space.</p>

<p>We contributed to Linux 5.8 a driver for the IOMMU introduced by
Allwinner in their H6 SoC. Compared to the IOMMUs found on modern PCs,
its design is a bit simple: it doesn’t support virtualization, there’s a
single address space, and it doesn’t cover all the devices doing DMA in
the system but solely the DMA intensive ones: the video and display
devices.</p>
<p>The driver thus registers and allows a single domain and group since the
IOMMU can’t isolate devices from one another, and it supports a single
address space. Despite these limitations though, it’s still a welcome
addition for all the reasons above.</p>
<p>Video and display controllers also require a lot of big, contiguous
buffers allocated through the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) on
earlier SoCs. CMA works by putting aside a part of the system RAM at
boot, and allocating big buffers from that area. There’s a big drawback
now though: the system has to maintain a rather big (in the 100 MB
order), static, pool of RAM put aside, no matter if the system is going
to use its video or display capabilities, and without any way to give
the RAM back if it doesn’t. As we discussed, an IOMMU has the capability
to map several, separate, chunks in physical memory to provide a
contiguous buffer in the device virtual space, effectively reducing (or
even removing) the need for CMA.</p>

<p>With Linux 5.8 onward, the Allwinner H6 uses its IOMMU with the DRM
display driver and the Cedrus video decoder driver. As time goes by and
we enable its usage across more drivers, it benefits more devices.
And with any luck, more Allwinner SoCs will feature an IOMMU.</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>

<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>

<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<p> In 2020, we are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0358">publication</a>  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> in <em>Neural Computation</em> (2010) on deep multilayer perceptrons trained by plain gradient descent on GPU. Surprisingly, our simple but unusually deep supervised artificial neural network (NN) outperformed all previous methods on the (back then famous) machine learning benchmark MNIST. That is, by 2010, when compute was 100 times more expensive than today, both our <em>feedforward</em> NNs <em>and</em> our earlier <em>recurrent</em> NNs (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">CTC-LSTM for connected handwriting recognition</a>) were  able to beat all competing algorithms on important problems of that time. In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this deep learning revolution 
quickly spread from Europe to America and Asia. 
</p><hr>


<p>  
Just one decade ago, many thought that deep NNs  
cannot learn much without  unsupervised pre-training,
a technique 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">introduced by myself in 1991</a> <a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a> and later also championed by others, e.g., <a href="#UN4">[UN4-5]</a> <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a> <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>. In fact, it was
 claimed <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a>
that <em>"nobody in their right mind would ever suggest"</em>  
to use plain gradient descent through <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a> <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>
(see also <a href="#BPA">[BPA-C]</a> 
 <a href="#BP2">[BP2-6]</a> <a href="#R7">[R7]</a>)
 to train feedforward NNs (FNNs) with many layers of neurons.


</p><p> However, in March 2010, our team with  my outstanding Romanian 
postdoc Dan Ciresan  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> 
showed that deep FNNs  
can indeed be trained by plain backpropagation 
 for important applications.  
This neither required <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html">unsupervised pre-training</a>  
nor Ivakhnenko's incremental  layer-wise training of 1965 <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a>. 
By the standards of 2010, our supervised NN had many layers.
It  set a new performance record <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> on 
the back then famous and widely used image recognition benchmark called MNIST <a href="#MNI">[MNI]</a>.
This was achieved by greatly accelerating traditional 
multilayer perceptrons on highly parallel 
graphics processing units called GPUs, going beyond the important GPU
work of Jung &amp; Oh (2004) <a href="#GPUNN">[GPUNN]</a>. 
A reviewer called this a 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">"wake-up call to the machine learning community."</a>

</p><p> Our results set the stage for the recent <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">decade of deep learning</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>. In February 2011, our team extended the approach to deep Convolutional NNs (CNNs) <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>. This 
greatly improved earlier work
 <a href="#GPUCNN">[GPUCNN]</a>.  
The so-called <em>DanNet</em>
<a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a> <a href="#R6">[R6]</a> broke several benchmark records.
In May 2011, <em>DanNet</em> was
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">the first deep CNN to win a computer vision competition</a> <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN3">[GPUCNN3]</a>. 
In August 2011, it was 
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">the first to win a vision contest with superhuman performance</a>
 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Our team kept winning vision contests in 2012 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Subsequently, many researchers adopted this technique.
By May 2015, we had the first extremely deep 
FNNs with more than 100 layers <a href="#HW1">[HW1]</a> (compare <a href="#HW2">[HW2]</a> <a href="#HW3">[HW3]</a>). 

</p><p> The original successes required a precise understanding of 
the inner workings of GPUs  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>.
Today, convenient software packages shield the user from such details. 
Compute is roughly 100 times cheaper than a decade ago, 
and many commercial NN applications are based on what started in 2010 <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.



 

</p><p>In this context it should be mentioned that right before the 2010s, our team had already achieved another breakthrough in supervised 
deep learning with the 
more powerful <em>recurrent</em> NNs (RNNs) whose basic architectures were introduced over
half a century earlier
<a href="#MC43">[MC43]</a> <a href="#K56">[K56]</a>.  
My PhD student Alex Graves won <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">three connected handwriting competitions (French, Farsi, Arabic)</a> at ICDAR 2009, the famous conference on document analysis and recognition. He used a combination of two methods developed in my research 
groups at TU Munich and the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA: Supervised LSTM RNNs (1990s-2005) <a href="#LSTM0">[LSTM0-6]</a>
(which overcome the famous 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fundamentaldeeplearningproblem.html">vanishing gradient problem</a>
 analyzed by my PhD student Sepp Hochreiter <a href="#VAN1">[VAN1]</a> in 1991) and <em>Connectionist Temporal Classification</em> <a href="#CTC">[CTC]</a> (2006).
CTC-trained LSTM was the first  RNN 
to win international contests.
Compare <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">Sec. 4</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> and <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#A">Sec. A</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#B">B</a> of <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>.

</p><p> That is,  by 2010, both our supervised FNNs and our supervised RNNs  
were able to outperform 
all other methods on important problems. 
In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this supervised  deep learning revolution quickly spread from Europe to North America and Asia,
with <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">enormous impact on industry and daily life</a>  <a href="#DL4">[DL4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.
However, it should be mentioned that
the conceptual roots of deep learning 
reach back deep into the previous millennium <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-2]</a> 
  <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2021">Sec. 21</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">Sec. 19</a>) <a href="#T20">[T20]</a> (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#II">Sec.

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>
