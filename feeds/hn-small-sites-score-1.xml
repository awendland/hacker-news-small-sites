            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<p>14th August 2019</p>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer is a Lisp interpreter that displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display, so you can see program execution and garbage collection in real time:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350">&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Visible Lisp Computer displays the contents of the Lisp workspace on an OLED display as it runs.</em></p>
<p>It's a special version of my uLisp interpreter for ARM boards <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, designed to run on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board, interfaced to an I2C OLED display.</p>
<p>For example, when you evaluate a recursive function, such as the Fibonacci function, you can see the memory being allocated to perform the calculation, and garbage collections clearing unused memory. Apart from being fun, it's educational, giving an insight into how a language with garbage collection works.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Visible Lisp Computer runs on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, which is an ideal ATSAMD21 board for running uLisp. It's available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>, or Pimoroni in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Lisp workspace is displayed on a 64x48 OLED display. This is an ideal fit, as uLisp running on an ATSAMD21 gives you a workspace of 3072 free Lisp objects (each of 8 bytes), and the 64x48 display provides 3072 pixels. I chose a low-cost monochrome I2C display, available from AliExpress&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. The program would also work on larger SSD1306-based OLED displays, such as the widely available 128x64 ones.</p>
<p>Free Lisp objects are displayed in black, and when an object is in use it is displayed in white. Periodically you see the garbage collection reclaiming used objects that can no longer be accessed.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's how to connect up the display to the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.gif" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.gif" width="457" height="245"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Visible Lisp Computer based on an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0.</em></p>
<p>You need pullup resistors of about 4.7kΩ from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<p>Instead of using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 you can build an equivalent Visible Lisp Computer using an ATSAMD21E on a prototyping board by following my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputerproto.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputerProto.jpg" width="710" height="375"></p>
<p><em>Version of the Visible Lisp Computer built on a prototyping board.</em></p>
<p>The I2C OLED display connects to GND, VCC, SDA (pin 21), and SCL (pin 22). Again, you need 4.7kΩ pullup resistors from SDA and SCL to VCC.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here's an example of the Visible Lisp Computer in action.</p>
<p>First we enter a sample Lisp function to evaluate; I'll use the Fibonacci function, as it should be familiar to most programmers:</p>
<pre>(defun fib (n)
  (if (&lt; n 3) 1
    (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))</pre>
<p>Initially the display is black. After entering this in the Serial Monitor the display shows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer1.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer1.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>The function is stored in the Lisp workspace as a series of Lisp objects, indicated by the row of white pixels starting in the top left corner.</p>
<p>Evaluating the function by entering, for example:</p>
<pre>(fib 10)</pre>
<p>allocates Lisp objects as the function is executed, indicated by a white block extending down from the top of the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer2.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer2.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<p>This call to the Fibonacci function executed within the workspace available, without triggering a garbage collection.</p>
<p>If we now evaluate:</p>
<pre>(fib 16)</pre>
<p>the function triggers several garbage collections as it executes to reclaim unused objects, while leaving the intermediate values, which are still in use, visible on the display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/visiblelispcomputer3.jpg" alt="VisibleLispComputer3.jpg" width="710" height="350"></p>
<h3>Turning off the workspace display</h3>
<p>The workspace display is on by default. Because updating the display causes Lisp programs to run more slowly, I've added a Lisp command&nbsp;to turn the display off; give the command:</p>
<pre>(display nil)</pre>
<p>To turn it back on again give the command:</p>
<pre>(display t)</pre>
<p>The standard version of uLisp does a garbage collection after you input each command at the Serial Monitor or REPL. When running the workspace display this is disabled, to avoid the lag caused by the garbage collection after every line of input. If you want to tidy up the screen display before running a program you can do a manual garbage collection by giving the command:</p>
<pre>(gc)</pre>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The workspace display interfaces with uLisp in three places. In each case a flag, <strong>DISPLAYFLAG</strong>, determines whether the workspace display is active.</p>
<h4>Lisp objects</h4>
<p>All objects in ARM uLisp consist of two 4-byte cells, so every object occupies 8 bytes. There are several different types of object, such as symbol, number, or cons, identified by the constant in the left-hand cell:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects1.gif" alt="Objects1.gif" width="422" height="80"></p>
<ul>
<li>A symbol contains '2' in the left cell, and the name of the symbol packed in the right cell, or a pointer to the symbol in a symbol table.</li>
<li>A number contains '4' in the left cell, and the 32-bit signed integer value in the right cell.</li>
<li>Finally, a cons contains an address pointer in each cell pointing to other objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Address pointers are always larger than the largest constant used to identify other types of object.</p>
<h4>Initialising the workspace</h4>
<p>When the workspace is first initialised, by calling <strong>initworkspace()</strong>, all the objects are added to a list of free objects:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects2.gif" alt="Objects2.gif" width="720" height="78"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels on the workspace display are plotted in black with a call to <strong>PlotObject()</strong>:</p>
<pre>void initworkspace () {
  Freelist = NULL;
  for (int i=WORKSPACESIZE-1; i&gt;=0; i--) {
    object *obj = &amp;Workspace[i];
    if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(i, 0);
    car(obj) = NULL;
    cdr(obj) = Freelist;
    Freelist = obj;
    Freespace++;
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Allocating an object</h4>
<p>A Lisp object in the workspace is allocated by a call to <strong>myalloc()</strong>. It's taken off the freelist and returned by the call. For example, creating the list:</p>
<pre>(fib 6)</pre>
<p>will take four objects from the freelist:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/objects4.gif" alt="Objects4.gif" width="720" height="130"></p>
<p>The corresponding pixels in the workspace display are plotted in white:</p>
<pre>object *myalloc () {
  if (Freespace == 0) error2(0, PSTR("no room"));
  object *temp = Freelist;
  Freelist = cdr(Freelist);
  Freespace--;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)temp - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 1);
  return temp;
}</pre>
<p>The address of the object is calculated by subtracting the address of the start of the workspace from the address of the new object, and dividing by eight because each Lisp object is 8 bytes.</p>
<h4>Freeing an object</h4>
<p>Finally, a Lisp object is freed by a call to <strong>myfree()</strong>. It is put on the front of the freelist, and the corresponding pixel in the workspace display is plotted in black:</p>
<pre>inline void myfree (object *obj) {
  car(obj) = NULL;
  cdr(obj) = Freelist;
  Freelist = obj;
  if (tstflag(DISPLAYFLAG)) PlotObject(((int)obj - (int)Workspace)&gt;&gt;3, 0);
  Freespace++;
}</pre>
<p>Objects are freed automatically during garbage collection; the programmer doesn't have to worry about freeing objects.</p>
<h4>Graphics display routines</h4>
<p>This display maps each byte in the display memory to a vertical column of eight pixels. Unfortunately the SSD1306 display driver chip doesn't support reading back of the contents of the display memory, so to provide the ability to change a single pixel, without affecting the others in the same column, a copy of the display memory is maintained in RAM; fortunately it's only 384 bytes (64x48/8).</p>
<p>The routines used to implement the workspace display are <strong>InitDisplay()</strong>, to initialise the OLED display, <strong>ClearDisplay()</strong> to clear the display, and <strong>PlotObject()</strong>, which plots a pixel corresponding to a Lisp object in the workspace.</p>
<h3>Uploading the program</h3>
<p>Whether you're using an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0, or an ATSAMD21E on a breadboard as described in my article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2833">Minimal ATSAMD21 Computer</a>, upload the Visible Lisp Computer as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already got it, install the <strong>Adafruit SAMD Boards</strong> in the <strong>Boards Manager</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong> board.</li>
<li>Upload the Visible Lisp Computer file to the board.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should then be able to run uLisp, and enter commands at the Serial Monitor as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>This is based on the current version of uLisp, Version 2.8a, but for simplicity it only supports the&nbsp;<strong>Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0</strong>&nbsp;Boards Manager option.</p>
<p>Here's the whole Visible Lisp Computer program:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/list?2OLU">Visible Lisp Computer program</a>.</p>
<p>Or get it from GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/visible-lisp-computer" target="_blank">Visible Lisp Computer</a>.</p>
<h3>Further suggestions</h3>
<p>The current project simply distinguishes between an allocated Lisp object (white) and a free object (black). Using a colour display you could use different colours to identify the different types of object: nil, symbol, integer, stream, character, float, string, or cons.</p><hr>

<p>The first one to take the stage was <strong>Jeff Cox</strong>, the engineering director at Google, to talk about the state of Bazel.</p>
<p>He remembered the history of Bazel and the idea behind the tool. During the talk, he presented the major achievements of the year.
In particular, the port of Bazel for arm64 platforms, the improvement of tools like Startlark CPU profiler and remote execution profiling.
On the other side, there were some lows, and Cox underlined how the huge backlog of PRs and issues that need to be addressed will be a priority for the team next year.</p>

<em>Jeff Cox explains the reason behind Bazel’s name.</em></p>
<p><strong>Cox presented the roadmap</strong> for the tool and stated how the focus will be to evolve Bazel as a Platform. They want to improve Startlark rules API, revamp the external dependencies support to make it more usable for developers, and improve remote execution support.
He also announced that starting from December, there will be <strong>Long Term Support releases</strong> with 9 months support window.</p>
<h2>Migrating Twitter’s Monorepo from Pants to Bazel</h2>
<p><strong>Borja Lorente</strong>, Build Engineer at Twitter, explained how Twitter is migrating his monorepo from their in-house tool Pants to Bazel.</p>
<p>Twitter repo is a multilanguage 20 million lines of code plus a 10x generated code and over 2000 developers working on it. They wanted to minimize the friction for users during the migration, so <strong>big bang commits were not an option.</strong> As Lorente explained, migrating all at once would have been a pain both for users who had to learn how to use Bazel and for the build team that had to support the developers.</p>
<p>So they decided to do it gradually and maintain both Pants and Bazel at the same time. They did it by developing a <strong>Translation Layer</strong>. Bazel imports the Translation Layer at load time, uses it to translate Pants targets into Bazel rules, and returns the build graph containing Bazel targets.</p>

<em>Borja Lorente explains the Translation Layer at Twitter.</em></p>
<p><strong>But it’s not so straightforward.</strong>
There are differences between Pants and Bazel that the build team is tackling. Some of them involve dependencies.</p>
<p>In Pants targets have implicitly all their transitive dependencies when being compiled, rather in Bazel, you must explicitly export them. For 3rd party dependencies, Pants decide the version to use based on the build target, in Bazel, you need to explicitly define them before running.</p>
<p>Twitter journey to Bazel is still in progress and those and other issues are currently worked on by the build team.</p>
<h2>Designing a Language Agnostic CI using Bazel Queries</h2>
<p><strong>Urvashi Reddy</strong>, Software Engineer at Pinterest from the Engineering Productivity Team presented a tool developed by her team to speed up their CI feedback cycle.</p>
<p>They realized that the CI was not able to detect which target changed so was it was frequently building all the targets.</p>
<p><strong>This was too time-consuming.</strong></p>
<p>They wanted to improve the situation by providing fast and reproducible builds and, at the same time, use a self-service approach: developers only need to write a BUILD file and not any new CI configuration.
In this scenario, <strong>the BUILD file is the contract</strong> between developers and CI: developers dictate what want to run in CI within the BUILD file and the CI will take care of that.</p>

<em>Urvashi Reddy explains how the CI stages work.</em></p>
<p>Reddy and her team developed a tool called <strong>build-collector</strong> that, given two commit SHAs, outputs the minimal set of modified targets.</p>
<p>The tool understands the kind of file changed and based on that runs a query to collect the affected targets. These targets are then used for the test stage and for the build and release stages. For the test stage, the tool runs an additional query to filter out only the test targets. For the build and release stages, they use another query but the strategy is different.</p>
<p>Reddy’s team has written a <strong>custom release macro</strong> used to publish release artifacts, called artifacts<em>ci</em>release. The macro makes the query easier since the build-collector can use it to collect the targets for the build and release stages.</p>
<p>Among the next steps, the team is planning to use an automatic process to <strong>identify flaky tests</strong>, tag them, and remove them from the running tests in CI. They also want to improve the query analysis performance using hashes.</p>
<h2>Adopting Bazel in a Quickly Scaling Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Charles Essien</strong>, Engineering Lead at CarGurus, talked about how he and his team went from knowing next to nothing about Bazel to actively work with the Bazel community.</p>
<p>Pre Bazel the CarGurus’ monorepo had a lot of <strong>Dark Debt</strong>: it’s the measurable range on known unknowns or the things that you know you have to improve upon. The Dark Debt at CarGurus was in the form of a 1.2M lines of code monorepo where it was too easy to include packages and dependencies transitively in monolithic artifacts, slow build times, and <strong>a build that you couldn’t trust.</strong></p>
<p>Essien explained how he and his team chose Bazel not only for the reproducible build but also to <strong>simplify</strong>: they managed to remove a lot of old code while adding only a few new to make Bazel work, decreasing the potential for tech debt. The team enabled developers to easily write new libraries and to safely reuse code thanks to BUILD visibility.</p>
<p>Talking about performance, after the bazelization, the build time went from 18 minutes with Maven in a developer laptop to 8 minutes with Bazel without a shared remote cache. With remote caching and remote execution, configured for a build without the bytes, the build time goes <em>from 90 seconds to 5 and a half minutes</em> in the worst case.</p>

<em>Charles Essien explaining the results of the bazelization.</em></p>
<p>The migration took 2 years and there were some huge challenges to face, one of the biggest was to <strong>clean up their java dependency graph</strong> and get rid of transitive dependencies, cyclic dependencies, and even duplicated dependencies. Essien had to work with developers in his organization to understand the intent behind dependencies and that slowed down the transition. He also mentioned that getting developers trust the tool and don’t clean the build was definitely not easy.</p>
<p>There were some takeaways from the migration. <strong>Observability is key</strong> since Essien and his team measured build times for Maven and Bazel and used it as a metric to show the practical benefits of Bazel. Another thing to focus on is the reproducibility of the build, meaning better caching for developers and less “it worked on my machine” as you scale</p>

Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act.

Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

<p><em>This is the first of a series of two articles describing the reasoning and the steps behind the idea of correlating software product delivery process performance metrics with community health and collaboration metrics as a way to engage execution managers so their teams participate in Open Source projects and Inner Source programs.  </em>What you will read in these articles is an extension of a talk I gave at the event InnerSource Commons Fall 2020.</p>



<p>Background</p>



<p>There is a very popular African proverb within the Free Software movement that says…</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</em>“</p>



<p>Many of us used it for years to promote collaboration among commercial organizations over doing it internally in a fast way at the risk of reinventing the wheel, not following standards, reducing quality, etc.</p>

<p>The proverb describes an implicit <em>OR</em> relation between the traditional Open Source mindset, focused on longer term results obtained through extensive collaboration, and the traditional corporate mindset, where time-to-market is almost an obsession.</p>



<p>Early in my career I got exposed as manager (I do not code) to agile and a little later to Continuous Delivery. This second set of principles and practices had a big impact on me because of the tight and positive correlation that proposes between speed and quality. Until then, I had assumed that such correlation was negative, when one increases the other decreases or vice-versa.</p>



<p>During a long time, I also assumed unconsciously as truth the negative correlation between collaboration and speed. It was not until I started working in projects at scale when I became aware of such unconscious assumption and start question it first and challenging it later.</p>



<p>In my early years in Open Source I found myself many times discussing with executives and managers about the benefits of this “collaboration framework” and why they should adopt it. Like probably many of you, I found myself being more successful among executives and politicians than middle layer managers.</p>



<p>– “No wonder they are executives” I thought more than once back then.</p>



<p>But time prove me wrong once again.</p>



<p>Problem statement: can we go faster by going together?</p>



<p>It was not until later on in my career, when I could relate to good Open Source evangelists but specially good sales professionals. I learned a bit about how different groups within the same organization are incentivized differently and you need to understand those incentives to tune your message in a a way that they can relate to it.</p>



<p>Most of my arguments and those from my colleagues back then were focused on cost reductions and collaboration, on preventing silos, on shorten innovation cycles, on sustainability, prevention of vendor lock-in, etc. Those arguments resonate very well among those responsible for strategic decisions or those managers directly related with innovation. But they did not work well with execution managers, specially senior ones.</p>



<p>When I have been a manager myself in the software industry, frequently my incentives had little to do with those arguments. In some cases, either my manager’s incentives had little to do with such arguments despite being an Open Organization. Open Source was part of the company culture but management objectives had little to do with collaboration. Variables like productivity, efficiency, time-to-market, customer satisfaction, defects management, release cycles, yearly costs, etc., were the core incentives that drove my actions and those around me. </p>



<p>If that was the case for those organizations I was involved in back then, imagine traditional corporations. Later on I got engage with such companies which confirmed this intuition.</p>



<p>I found myself more than once arguing with my managers about priorities and incentives, goals and KPIs because, as Open Source guy, I was for some time unable to clearly articulate the positive correlation between collaboration and efficiency, productivity, cost reduction etc. In some cases, this inability was a factor in generating a collision that end up with my bones out of the organization.</p>



<p>That positive correlation between collaboration and productivity was counter-intuitive for many middle managers I know ten years ago. Still is for some, even in the Open Source space. Haven’t you heard from managers that if you want to meet deadlines do not work upstream because you go move slower? I’ve heard so many times that, as mentioned before, during years I believed it was true. It might at small scale, but at big scale, it is not necessarily true.</p>



<p>It was not until two or three years ago that I started paying attention to Inner Source. I realized that many have inherited this belief. And since they live in corporate environments, the challenge that represents convincing execution related managers is bigger than in Open Source. </p>



<p>Inner Source programs are usually supported by executives and R&amp;D departments but receive resistance from middle management, especially those closer to execution units. Collaborating with other departments might be good in the long term but it is perceived as less productive than developing in isolation. Somehow, in order to participate in Inner Source programs, they see themselves choosing between shorter-term and longer-term goals, between their incentives and those of the executives. It has little to do with their ability to “<em>get it</em>“.</p>



<p>So either their incentives are changed and they demonstrate that the organization can still be profitable, or you need to adapt to those incentives. What I believe is that adapting to those incentives means, in a nutshell, to provide a solid answer to the question, <em>can we go faster by going together?</em></p>



<p>The proposed solution: if you want to go far, together is faster.</p>



<p>If we could find a positive correlation between efficiency/productivity and collaboration, we could change the proverb above by something like…</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1390" data-permalink="https://toscalix.com/the_solution/" data-orig-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg" data-orig-size="5658,1590" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the_solution" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=656" src="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=150 150w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=300 300w, https://toscalixdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the_solution.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>And hey, technically speaking, it would still be an African proverb, since I am from the Canary Islands, right?.</p>



<p>The idea behind the above sentence is to establish an <em>AND</em> relation between speed and collaboration meeting both, traditional corporate and Open Source (and Inner Source) goals. </p>



<p>Proving such positive correlation could be help to reduce the resistance offered by middle management to practice collaboration at scale either within Inner Source programs or Open Source projects. They would perceive such participation as a path to meet those longer term goals without contradicting many of the incentives they work with and they promote among their managees.</p>



<p>So the following question is, how we can do that? how can we provide evidences of such positive correlation in a language that is familiar to those managers?</p>



<p>The solution summarized: ISC Fall 2020</p>



<p>I tried to briefly explain to people running Inner Source programs, during the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-fall-2020-agenda/">ISC Fall 2020</a>, a potential path to establish such relation in five not-so-simple steps. The core slide of my presentation enumerated them as:</p>



<p>1.- In addition to collaboration and community health metrics, I recommend to track product delivery process performance ones.<br>2.- Correlate both groups of metrics.<br>3.- Focus on decisions and actions that creates a positive correlation between them.<br>4.- Create a reporting strategy to developers and managers based on such positive correlation.<br>5.- Use such strategy to turn around your Inner Source/Open Source story: it is about creating positive business impact at scale through open collaboration.</p>



<p>A detailed explanation of these five points can be found in the second article of this series:</p>

<p>“How do you distinguish between sync vs. async vs. concurrent vs. parallel?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a question you’ll probably be asked in your first technical interview.</p>
<p>Having witnessed a lot of answers from interviewees, I see that people know the terms, but they rarely understand what they conceptually are.</p>
<p>Knowing the use cases is essential. However, just knowing the use cases also limits yourself to only those use cases. That’s why interviewers want to ask you this question⁠ - they want to see whether you’re able to introduce solutions for new use cases.</p>
<p>Now, let’s break the code.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605595364190/9uu39gZuF.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are two different programming models, which refer to styles of programming - how you should write code and how your code will run.</p>
<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>
<p>In the sync programming model, you write code as steps ⁠— your code is executed from top to bottom, step by step, and it only gets to the second step when it has finished the first step.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>step1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>step2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    step1()
    step2()
}


</code></pre><p>Because of its predictable behavior, sync is also called a <em>predictable programming model</em>. Most programming languages use sync as its base programming model.</p>
<h3 id="async">Async</h3>
<p>In an async programming model, you write code as tasks, which are then executed concurrently. Executing concurrently means that all the tasks are likely executed at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>task1</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"1"</span>) }
<span><span>func</span> <span>task2</span><span>()</span></span> { <span>print</span>(<span>"2"</span>) }

<span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span></span> {
    task1()
    task2()
}


</code></pre><p>As you can see in the result of the example, because tasks are executed at the same time you can not predict the result. And due to that behavior, async is also called an <em>unpredictable programming model</em>. It’s useful for use cases in which you do tasks that do not depend on each other and for which you don’t care about the execution order.</p>
<hr>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605596051556/KfHDzfWx8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We mentioned concurrent behaviors once when discussing the async programming model. In an async programming model, tasks are treated as a single step that runs multiple tasks, and they do not care about how those tasks are ordered or run to each other. They can be run simultaneously, or, in some cases, there’ll be some tasks that run first and then pause and other tasks that come in turns, etc. That behavior is called <em>concurrent</em>.</p>
<p>Take an example in real life: There’s a challenge that requires you to both eat a whole huge cake and sing a whole song. You’ll win if you’re the fastest who sings the whole song and finishes the cake. So the rule is that you sing and eat concurrently. How you do that does not belong to the rule. You can eat the whole cake, then sing the whole song, or you can eat half a cake, then sing half a song, then do that again, etc.</p>
<p>The same applies to computer science. There are two tasks executing concurrently, but those are run in a 1-core CPU, so the CPU will decide to run a task first and then the other task or run half a task and half another task, etc. It all depends on the system architecture.</p>
<p>If we keep going with the same example, the rule is still singing and eating concurrently, but this time you play in a team of two. You probably will eat and let your friend sing (because she sings better and you eat better). So this time, the two tasks are really executed simultaneously, and it’s called <em>parallel</em>. Parallelism is a specific kind of concurrency where tasks are really executed simultaneously. In computer science, parallelism can only be achieved in multicore environments.</p>
<hr>

<p>Sync and async are programming models.</p>
<p>Concurrent and parallel are ways tasks are executed, where parallel is a narrow version of concurrent.</p>
<p>In sync, you write code as steps that are executed in order, from top to bottom. There’s no concurrency or parallelism here.</p>
<p>In async, you write code as tasks that are executed concurrently. You never know which tasks will be started first - it depends on the executing context, whether you run tasks in parallel or do a bit of one task then progress to another.</p>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on your team?</p><p>Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be career limiting.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_superpos_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, iterations=<span>8</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated Superpositioned terrain that looks real world like.
    """</span>
    terrains = []

    
    weight_sum = <span>0</span>

    
    <span>for</span> z <span>in</span> range(iterations, <span>0</span>, <span>-1</span>):
        terrain = []

        
        weight = <span>1</span> / (<span>2</span> ** (z - <span>1</span>))

        
        
        sample = <span>1</span> &lt;&lt; (iterations - z)

        
        sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]
        
        weight_sum += weight

        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

            
            terrain.append(weight * sample_points[i])

            
            
            <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
                
                mu = (j + <span>1</span>) / sample

                
                a = sample_points[i]
                b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
                v = linp(a, b, mu)

                
                terrain.append(weight * v)

        
        
        terrains.append(terrain)

    
    
    <span>return</span> [sum(x)/weight_sum <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> zip(*terrains)]
</code></pre>
<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

They were writing code the whole time, and I was on the phone the whole time, and being in the office we ended up interrupting each other. So eventually we started working from our homes and only got together when we needed to catch up.</p><p>As the company grew, we were hiring lots of artists and freelancers based everywhere from Los Angeles to Toronto. Even though there were more of us, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office space when most of the team was somewhere else anyway. We could simply hop on Skype, have our conversation, and get back to work. We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Mining Haul Trucks – The Largest SVBIEDs In The World"><div><p><span>The SVBIEDs used by the Islamic State (IS) throughout the years have come in all different sizes. Everything from sedans, to pick-up trucks, heavy transport trucks, heavy construction equipment, and military armoured vehicles have been converted into rolling bombs. While large shell vehicles have been relatively common, there’s one rare category of vehicles completely unmatched both in its absurd size and obscurity <span>— t</span>he mining haul trucks. There has only been 3 recorded cases of IS using this vehicle type in SVBIED attacks, ever.&nbsp;In this article I will be detailing all available information about these attacks, beginning with the first example in August, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 1 — Homs province, Syria (August, 2015)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late May 2015, IS managed to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11633289/Isil-seizes-Syrian-regimes-lucrative-phosphate-mines.html">seize the strategic town of Khunayfis</a>, located approximately 60 kilometres to the Southwest of Palmyra in the central Syrian desert of Homs province. Along with the town, IS militants also seized the Khunayfis phosphate mine. The mine is one of two in the area, with the other one located at al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. In a photo released by IS from the Sawwanah facility which was also captured around the same time,&nbsp;at least 6 <a href="https://belsat.eu/en/news/isis-militants-have-worlds-biggest-armored-cars-made-belarusian-belaz-dump-trucks/">Belarusian-made Belaz&nbsp;haul trucks</a> could be seen lined up. These massive vehicles are traditionally employed in large mining operations, but IS would find a much more destructive use for them.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="619" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015.jpg 980w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-300x189.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khunayfis-phosphate-mine-near-palmyra_lateMay2015-768x485.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px">In the spirit of experimentation and not letting anything go to waste, IS decided to move one of these Belaz haul trucks to one of their workshops near the town of al-Qaryatayn, where it would be overhauled to function as an SVBIED. It’s unclear whether the chosen haul truck was taken from Khunayfis or al-Sharqiyah/as-Sawwanah. A photo taken during the manufacturing process showed that the massive vehicle had been plastered with a primary layer of improvised frontal armour in the form of metal sheets, and a secondary layer of improvised slat armour on top. At the time of the photo, the driver’s cabin had not yet been up-armoured.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="734" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04.jpg 444w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.25.04-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px">On August 19th 2015, the finished haul truck SVBIED was featured in an official IS photo report. With the addition of improvised metal sheets, armoured glass, as well as slat armour to the driver’s cabin, the vehicle was ready to depart on its mission.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg" alt="" width="1021" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42.jpg 1021w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.42-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px">In one of the photos, the driver of the SVBIED&nbsp;(“Abu Abdullah al-Ansari”) could be seen posing in front of the haul truck.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="575" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29.jpg 1023w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.24.29-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px">According to IS themselves, the haul truck had been fitted with a hefty explosive payload weighing in at 8 tons. The chosen target for this monstrous SVBIED was the Syrian loyalist-controlled Mafraq checkpoint, located Northeast of al-Qaryatayn. Although the operation itself wasn’t shown in a video, a distant night vision photograph of the detonation was included in the photo report.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>No. 2 — Anbar province, Iraq (January, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In late January 2017, an Iraqi fighter uploaded a remarkable <a href="https://twitter.com/HKaaman/status/825804781352529920">video</a>. The 2-minute long video, shot somewhere in Iraq’s Anbar desert, featured the second recorded example of a Belaz haul truck converted into an up-armoured SVBIED.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-300x167.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-768x428.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.34-1024x571.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The frontal armour mounted on this haul truck appeared a lot more reserved and inconspicuous than that of its predecessor. Instead of applying a wall of metal sheets to the front, smaller sections had been mounted to key areas. For example, a large centre piece metal sheet shielded the engine. The slats in the sheet were purposely designed to prevent the engine from overheating. A smaller piece of improvised armour was also mounted in front of the&nbsp;right-side set of frontal wheels. The driver’s cabin was the most heavily shielded, with large metal sheets and armoured glass protecting the driver. This change in armour placement is actually fairly logical. The engine, driver’s cabin, and wheels are the weakest points on the haul truck. Hence, most of the work put in to overhaul the vehicle focused on these 3 crucial areas. However, seeing as this haul truck SVBIED was captured before it could be employed in battle, it’s unclear whether more armour additions were intended. a smaller piece of improvised armour mounted in front of he left-side set of frontal wheels seem to be the only component missing though.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg" alt="" width="1277" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50.jpg 1277w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-768x429.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.38.50-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px">The overhauled haul truck was found parked at the lower end of a ramp leading into a large desert dug-out. Looking at the vehicle from inside the underground storage facility, it appeared far more imposing.</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18.jpg 1273w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.40.18-1024x574.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1273px) 100vw, 1273px">The video also included a short look at the rather large explosive payload. The payload consisted of a series of explosive-filled jugs, barrels and gas tanks wired together. Taking into account the size of the rear bed of the haul truck, there was likely more than one layer of IEDs. However, the top layer alone was quite impressive. I estimate the top layer alone consisting of at least 30 large jugs (blue), around 100 smaller jugs (white/yellow/red/green), and 3 gas tanks. Seeing as we don’t know exactly how much explosives were contained in each jug, it’s &nbsp;difficult to get a precise estimate of the weight of the payload.</span></p>

More than 100 standardised pressure plate IEDs were discovered at this specific site.&nbsp;</span></p>

The video itself didn’t provide specifics as to where the SVBIED was seized other than it being in Anbar province. However, there are a number of large mining operations in Anbar province previously under IS control where it could have been taken from originally, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashat">Akashat</a> facility.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No. 3 — Nineveh province, Iraq (May, 2017)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As the battle for Western Mosul entered its final stages in May 2017, the remaining IS contingent put up a fierce defence. In an official video released by IS in mid-May 2017, the third and final example of an up-armoured haul truck SVBIED was featured along with a series of other standardised SVBIEDs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg" alt="" width="1262" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27.jpg 1262w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-768x430.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.51.27-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px">The armour placement on this example was noticeably more refined and all-encompassing compared to the previous two examples. A series of inter-connected metal plates covered the entire front of the vehicle. Angled armour with air intakes shielded the engine, and a piece of armoured glass acted as a viewing port for the driver as per usual. Furthermore, both sides of the original rear bed had been removed in favour of an improvised metal sheet. This example was also the first to have been fitted with rear armour shielding the rear wheel sets from incoming fire.</span></p>
<p><span>Identical writings in Arabic on both the frontal armour above the driver’s viewing port and on the rear bed side armour could be roughly translated into “B150”&nbsp;<span><strong>—</strong>&nbsp;a unique identifying serial number.</span></span></p>

The video that this example was featured in actually featured very short snippets of the interior, offering a clue as to how it was set up. In the first section, an IS fighter could be seen climbing up into the vehicle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg" alt="" width="1257" height="706" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17.jpg 1257w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-300x168.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.17-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1257px) 100vw, 1257px">A look at the driver’s seat showed the armoured glass from the inside, and also provided a glimpse of the white box detonation mechanism mounted next to the steering wheel on the right,<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="710" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54.jpg 1260w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-768x433.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-10.49.54-1024x577.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px">The gunner of this 2-man SVBIED was positioned in the next room, protected by improvised metal armour on all sides. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/calibreobscura?lang=en">Calibre Obscura</a>, an expert on identifying small arms, the primary armament was a Chinese-made 12.7mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W85_heavy_machine_gun">W85</a> heavy machine gun fixed on what looked like an improvised pintle mount. The secondary armaments included both a Soviet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PK_machine_gun">PK</a> machine gun, as well as what appeared to be a Bulgarian AK-type rifle.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg" alt="" width="1271" height="714" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07.jpg 1271w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-768x431.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-25-at-13.37.07-1024x575.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1271px) 100vw, 1271px">Now, where did IS source this vehicle from? It definitely wasn’t transported all the way from Anbar province. Conveniently enough, the previously IS-controlled Badush cement plant, located approximately 20 kilometres Northwest of W. Mosul operated multiple Belaz haul trucks. When the Iraqi army recaptured the cement plant in June 2017, what remained of the facility and its vehicles was documented in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WytqV_x7c4">video</a> by al-Mawsliya TV. The “B” in the identifying serial number of this example (“B150”) may also have been a reference to its origin, the Badush plant.<img loading="lazy" src="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg" alt="" width="1139" height="594" srcset="https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45.jpg 1139w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-300x156.jpg 300w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-768x401.jpg 768w, https://hugokaaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-24-at-20.18.45-1024x534.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px"></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Efficient use, or Propaganda?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The real question here is whether using gigantic haul trucks as SVBIED shells serves a purpose other than an aesthetic one. Because, let’s face it&nbsp;– The ones that have been recorded really do look impressive. Looking beyond that, the efficiency of using this type of SVBIED is very questionable.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, it doesn’t really make sense to use such a massive shell vehicle as a vessel to carry explosives. When you have a smaller shell vehicle, such as a pick-up truck or even a heavy truck, the vehicle itself acts as more shrapnel and debris upon detonation. However, the bigger and heavier the shell vehicle is, the more explosives is required in order to render it a viable option. For example, mining haul trucks weigh in at around 45 tons, an absurd weight. When you use it as an SVBIED, the frame of the vehicle will absorb a lot of the explosive energy of the payload upon detonation. And while IS claimed that the first haul truck SVBIED had an explosive payload of 8 tons, it’s not really that much when you account for the weight of the haul truck itself and the explosives required to tear it apart.</span></p>
<p><span>The comparatively smaller category of heavy trucks can still carry payloads of the same weight class, and they don’t carry with them the problem of the frame of the vehicle itself being too large. In this aspect, there’s no logic at all to using haul trucks.</span></p>
<p><span>The large size and weight of the haul trucks presents another issue as well. Their slow speed, combined with their large profile, means that they’ll be large targets advancing toward their targets slowly. This means that the opposing force will have a lot more time to fire on a much larger target than …</span></p></div></article></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Dynamic quantization quantize the weights of neural networks to integers, but the activations are dynamically quantized during inference. Comparing to floating point neural networks, the size of dynamic quantized model is much smaller since the weights are stored as low-bitwidth integers. Comparing to other quantization techniques, dynamic quantization does not require any data for calibration or fine-tuning. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">“Quantization for Neural Networks”</a>.</p>



<p>Given a pre-trained floating point model, we could easily create an dynamically quantized model, run inference, and potentially achieve better latency without too much additional effort. In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do dynamic quantizations.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-dynamic-quantization">PyTorch Dynamic Quantization</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow is as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a dynamic quantization wrapper.</p>



<p>In this case, I would like to use the BERT-QA model from HuggingFace Transformers as an example. I was dynamically quantizing the <code>torch.nn.Linear</code> layer for the BERT-QA model since the majority of the computation for Transformer based models are matrix multiplications.</p>

<p>With PyTorch 1.7.0, we could do dynamic quantization using x86-64 and aarch64 CPUs. However, NVIDIA GPUs have not been supported for PyTorch dynamic quantization yet.</p>

According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the "richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans "grew up in substantial privilege".

<p>We could see that the model size of the INT8 quantized model is much smaller than the FP32 model. The inference latency of INT8 dynamic quantization on CPU is much faster than the FP32 ordinary inference on CPU. However, FP32 inference using NVIDIA GPU is still the fastest.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>When <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim">Tim</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron">Aaron</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian">I</a>
started working on this problem in August 2018 we immediately began playing with <a href="https://github.com/attic-labs/noms">Noms</a>.
It was an open source project that gave us a lot of the things Aaron and I had been talking about in order to deliver the
features we felt were critical to our success.  Noms gave us the ability to efficiently diff across commits, and
merge commits.  Though Noms had become an inactive project, we felt it would tremendously improve our go to market
time to use it as our storage layer, so we decided it was worth diving deeper.</p>
<p>I built a demo of a command line tool that used the Git commands people already know in order to
version structured table data.  As we played with the demo, we felt like we were on to something, and
decided to really go after the "Git for Data" product that is <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> today. After additional
investment in delivering a fully featured Git-like command line we began to think about <a href="https://dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a>,
a place for our users to find, collaborate on, and store data projects. This was the first time we needed to access
data stored using Noms on backend servers, and it was at this time we discovered issues with how Noms handled errors.</p>

<p>I'm not going to go into detail on the language design decisions behind Go's panics and errors.  If you would like that
background before going further I'd take a look at <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/on-the-uses-and-misuses-of-panics-in-go/">this article</a>
which covers it in depth.  However, a nasty problem with panics is that a panic without a deferred recover on any go routine
will crash your program.  If you are writing a server handling many concurrent requests, any panic that escapes on any
go routine will cause every single one of the concurrently executing requests to fail.  All those connections will be
closed, and the server will restart. In a sufficiently complicated server where go routines handling requests
spawn additional go routines and use <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/communicating-sequential-processes-csp-for-go-developer-in-a-nutshell-866795eb879d">CSP</a>
to do work, using panics for flow control is a recipe for disaster. With so much invested in using Noms, we decided to
"hard fork" the project and eliminate the heavy use of panics.</p>

<p>The process of eliminating panics started out pretty straight forward.  Search the codebase for a panic, change the
signature of the method to return an error, and replace the panic.  Then find all the call sites where the method
and handle the error, or return it up the callstack.  I thought I'd be able to migrate from panics to errors
in about a week.  Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that Noms could panic when calculating the hash of its types I knew I was way off. In the
end I think I spent closer to 6 weeks on this.  It was time-consuming, and boring, but it couldn't be automated and every
one of the changes was an opportunity to introduce bugs.  Today, searching the updated Noms codebase for <code>if err != nil</code>
returns 1370 results, and I'm guessing more than half of those were introduced while removing panics. It effected hundreds
of function signatures.  Because Noms lies below our main application's code, the changes bubble up to all the code which
depends on Noms directly and indirectly. </p>

<p>GO advocates for using CSP in order to write concurrent code.  New go routines are spawned in order to do parallel processing
and channels are used to communicate between go routines.  It was in these cases where panics were causing the biggest problems,
and they were the more interesting cases to talk about when converting panics to errors, as converting these improperly
can introduce deadlocks.</p>
<p>Lets start by defining a simple function we want to run concurrently:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> workItem <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> workCh <span>{</span>
        res<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> <span>doWork</span><span>(</span>workItem<span>)</span>

        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> err
        <span>}</span>       

        resCh <span>&lt;-</span> res
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function takes a channel that it reads work items from, and a channel that it writes results to.  In the event that
an error is encountered the function returns the error. A straightforward, but erroneous way to handle this would be:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>myConcurrentFunc</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workItems WorkItem<span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span>WorkItemResult<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> err

        workItemResults <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>workItemResults<span>,</span> result<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>return</span> workItemResults<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first problem here, is that the <code>err</code> instance is modified and read in an unsafe manner.  This can be resolved using
a mutex or Go's atomic primitives, and this is a simplified version of how I handled these errors in many cases. I created
a class <code>AtomicError</code> that made these types of operations thread safe, but this example still has other issues. </p>
<p>If <code>process()</code> errors on one of the go routines, all the other ones will continue running until they all error, or
all the work items have been completed despite not having any impact (No matter what happens we are going to <code>return nil, err</code>).
Depending on the use, maybe this behavior is acceptable, but in cases where the operation takes a long time, this does not
work.  This can be fixed by testing the state of the atomic error in the <code>process</code> loop but it can make the code pretty ugly. </p>
<p>Another suboptimal characteristic of this code is that you need to create the channels with buffers
large enough to hold every work item, and result.  It is possible to avoid this also, but it involves additional synchronization
in order to close the result channel just a single time when an error is encountered, or when all work is done and the last
go processing routine exits.  </p>
<p>Finally, when we are talking about this being run on a server as a part of a request, there is the very real possibility
that the request may get cancelled for some reason, such as exceeding some pre-defined deadline.  In order to handle this
and the other errors in a cleaner way I wish I had known about <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>.</p>

<p>errgroup is an extremely simple package with just <a href="https://github.com/golang/sync/blob/master/errgroup/errgroup.go">a single small file</a>.
It uses the <code>context.Context</code> that is used throughout Golang to implement <code>errgroup.Group</code> which will update the context
if any one of them returns an error. Our updated code looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span>ctx context<span>.</span>Context<span>,</span> workCh <span>chan</span> WorkItem<span>,</span> resCh <span>chan</span> WorkItemResult<span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This code handles all the issues enumerated above, and it also allows the results to be handled concurrently with the
processing.  In the cases where you are doing something expensive with each result this could provide a performance
improvement.</p>

<p>There seems to be only one reason to use panics for flow control. Littering your code with explicit error checking after
every function call is tedious and ugly.  You are right, but the beauty of your code, won't improve your product. Go
forces explicit error handling that results in programs that do the appropriate things when error conditions are encountered.
It may be ugly, but I hope my pain and suffering serve as yet another reason not to use panics instead of returning errors.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>Published on 2019-09-01 by <a href="https://alexbakker.me/">Alexander Bakker</a></span></p><article><p>I think I experienced a random bit flip while updating Linux on one of my
machines today. My laptop was humming along happily during compilation until GCC
suddenly aborted with an error: <strong><em>invalid preprocessing directive #lefine; did
you mean #define?</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://alexbakker.me/img/random-bit-flip.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Huh, <code>#lefine</code> instead of <code>#define</code>?</p>

<p>Now, GCC is known for its cryptic error messages, but this one left me baffled.
Things I tried to figure out what the issue could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>I first grepped the offending file, <code>drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_reg.h</code>, for
<code>#lefine</code> to see if a typo somehow slipped through the Linux 4.19.1 release,
but got 0 matches.</li>
<li>When I resumed the build, it completed without errors. The kernel also
appeared to run fine upon reboot. I ended up recompiling it entirely multiple
times to see if I could reproduce the error, but I couldn’t.</li>
<li>I ran a MemTest86 test for 24 hours, but it didn’t find any errors, so the RAM
is also unlikely to be the culprit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I was losing my mind until it dawned on me that this could have been
caused by cosmic rays. Looking at ASCII table, we see that ’d’ and ‘l’ are
indeed one bit flip away from each other:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>char</th>
<th>decimal</th>
<th>binary</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>1100100</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>l</td>
<td>108</td>
<td>1101100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Could that be it? Isn’t that incredibly unlikely? There doesn’t appear to be a
consensus in existing literature <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> on how often these errors
actually occur, but I did learn that this phenomenon is actually more common
than I thought. The chances of flipping a bit that would cause software to break
in this fashion, on the other hand, must be incredibly small.</p>

<p>In the end, there’s just no way to prove that this was actually caused by cosmic
rays. It could also have been some other extremely rare hardware fluke. Either
way, this took me by surprise, to say the least.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the cosmos’ way of telling me to invest in ECC RAM.</p>

<p>France's RFI public radio has apologised for mistakenly publishing obituaries for a number of celebrities still very much alive, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Brazilian football legend Pele.</p>
<p>Citing a "technical problem" that caused the death notices to be released on its website today, the broadcaster said: "We offer our apologies to the people concerned and to you who follow and trust us.</p>
<p>"We are mobilising to rectify this major bug," said the Twitter account of RFI, which saw itself the target of much online derision for the error.</p>
<p>Others RFI declared dead included Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, former US President Jimmy Carter, Cuban leader Raul Castro, actors Clint Eastwood, Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>French business mogul Bernard Tapie, 77, whose obituary had been prematurely published by other news outlets at least twice before, was also on the RFI list.</p><blockquote>
<p>🔴 Un problème technique a entraîné la publication de nombreuses nécrologies sur notre site.<br>
Nous sommes mobilisés pour rectifier ce bug majeur et présentons nos excuses aux personnes concernées ainsi qu'à vous qui nous suivez et nous faites confiance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-776">

    

	<div>

		
<p>In the spirit of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html" target="_blank">A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux</a>,”  we are going to try to create a minimal 64 bit ELF executable using just standard D and some inline assembly code.</p>



<p>We are going to focus on creating the standard hello world executable popularized by Brian Kernighan. </p>



<p>In the standard D language, using the phobos library (the now only real standard library for D, previously there existed two competing standard libraries), we would write this as:</p>


<pre title="">import std.stdio;

int main(){
    write("Hello\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this:</p>



<pre><code>dmd basic_hello.d </code></pre>



<p>yields a 1.9M executable.</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./basic_hello
 1895528 ./basic_hello</code></pre>



<p>Using gdc brings it down to 28k. Note: gdc like gcc defaults to naming the executable ‘a.out’, whereas dmd names it after the file or module.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 28608 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So we get some improvement.  The biggest issue is that it is dynamically linking in a bunch of code we don’t need, including a bunch of machinery for exceptions we won’t throw, and code to handle cases we don’t need.  Really we just need to put a string to standard out, which is exactly what the C function puts is for.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;

int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>Compiling this with gdc give us a small decrease in size.</p>



<pre><code>gdc basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 21296 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Running ldd on it we can see we still pull in the D runtime even though we don’t need it.</p>



<p>&gt; ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd02db8000)<br>libgphobos.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgphobos.so.1 (0x00007f4b1caa8000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f4b1ca8d000)<br>libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c947000)<br>libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f4b1c925000)<br>libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4b1c91e000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4b1c753000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f4b1d09f000)</p>



<p>This is exactly what betterC mode is for! Let’s try it. We just need to modify our main function to be ‘extern(C)’.</p>


<pre title="">import core.stdc.stdio;
extern(C):
int main(){
    puts("Hello");
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>With gdc, betterC mode is called with the flag ‘no-druntime’.</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime basic_hello.d 
wc -c ./a.out
 20600 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>So that is pretty good and we are down to just 20k. And we are only linking against the standard C library.</p>



<p>&gt;ldd ./a.out<br>linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd119c7000)<br>libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f447f734000)<br>libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f447f569000)<br>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f447f783000)</p>



<p>We can run strip on it to save some space:</p>



<pre><code>strip -s ./a.out
wc -c ./a.out
 15016 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Now we are running into the limits of what we can do with linking to the C standard library without switching to musl.  And even there we are getting away from programming in D and instead just messing with optimizing C code, which is not the point of this article.</p>



<p>So how does the C standard library print a string to standard output?  In the end it performs a system call.  In modern Windows Microsoft makes it unreasonably hard to do this by changing the syscall numbers on every update.  This might stop some viruses that hardcode system calls, but makes it impossible to do any Windows programming without using the C standard library/Win32 API. So in this article we will focus on Linux in particular since the system call interface is explicitly blessed by the kernel developers.  FreeBSD and other Unices tend to prefer the usage of the C standard library API.  Here we will also just worry about the x86_64 architecture(being 2020, the only other architecture in major use that is widely supported by D compilers is AARCH64).</p>



<p>The system call interface for Linux is specified in the System V ABI document <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In short, you just pass the syscall number in the RAX register, and the other arguments in rdi, rsi, rdx, etc.</p>



<p>The 3 main D language compilers, DMD, GDC, and LDC, all have slightly different ways you can include assembly code inline.  Just for fun I wrote a version for each using their features.  One thing I noticed is when using the LDC version of inline assembly it mentions needing a comma separated list for the constraints. I included some spaces in the list and received an invalid asm constraint error that was ridiculously tricky to track down.</p>



<p>One other thing to note is that the main function we have been using so far is based on the fact that in the end we link to the standard C library which also has a main function that is called from another entry point, by not using the standard C library and the start files from it (which basically help the C language runtime set up some scaffolding it needs for ‘atexit’ and such (side side note, the C language does have a runtime, you just usually don’t notice it)) we no longer have an entry point.  Most things assume the entry point is called ‘_start’, but this can be overridden in the linker. </p>



<p>Let’s write our syscall routines in a file called syscall.d:</p>


<pre title="">module syscall;

    }



}

</pre>


<pre><code>And our _start entry point and some helper functions in hello.d:</code></pre>


<pre title="">import syscall;

immutable long SYS_WRITE = 1;
immutable long SYS_EXIT = 60;

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
size_t write(int fd, in char* buf, size_t count)
{
    return syscall3(SYS_WRITE, fd, cast(long) buf, count);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
pragma(inline, true):
void exit(long exit_code){
     syscall1(SYS_EXIT, exit_code);
}

extern (C):
@nogc:
nothrow:
void _start()
{
    write(1, "Hello\n", 6);
    exit(0);
}
</pre>


<p>We also need to link this file ourselves so that we don’t pull in any libc dependencies, we do this by using the ‘ld’ command and by just compiling and not linking (the ‘-c’ flag).</p>



<pre><code>gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs hello.d syscall.d -c 
ld ./hello.o
ldd ./a.out
         not a dynamic executable</code></pre>



<p>Cool so we now have a statically linked executable that has no dependence on the standard C library! How much did we save?</p>



<pre><code>wc -c ./a.out
 13672 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Ugh all that work and only 2k extra savings!  Lets see what is in the executable. We can get this by running ‘readelf -a’ on the executable. Our executable has 9 sections.</p>



<pre><code>[0]
[1] .text
[2] .rodata
[3] .eh_frame
[4] .data
[5] .comment
[6] .symtab
[7] .strtab
[8] .shstrtab</code></pre>



<p>The first that sticks out is the ‘.eh_frame’ section.  That is used for exception unwinding, stack cleanup and other assorted things we don’t need.  We can tell gdc that we don’t want those by adding two flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 9488 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>Awesome we just saved 4k, but there is still fat to trim.  One thing we can learn from reading the info pages for ‘ld’ is that there is a flag to help pack executables if you don’t need shared libraries, ‘-n’. Using this saves us about 3k:</p>



<pre><code>&gt;gdc -fno-druntime -nodefaultlibs  -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables  hello.d syscall.d -c 
&gt;ld -n ./hello.o
&gt;wc -c ./a.out
 6112 ./a.out</code></pre>



<p>If we look at the executable with readelf again we can see that the compiler outputs symbols for a lot of things we don’t need:</p>



<p>Symbol table ‘.symtab’ contains 21 entries:<br>Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name<br>0: 0000000000000000 0 NOTYPE LOCAL DEFAULT UND<br>1: 00000000004000b0 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 1<br>2: 00000000004002cf 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 2<br>3: 00000000004012d8 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 3<br>4: 0000000000000000 0 SECTION LOCAL DEFAULT 4<br>5: 0000000000000000 0 FILE LOCAL DEFAULT ABS test.d<br>6: 0000000000400187 32 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall0<br>7: 00000000004012e0 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test8SYS_EXITyl<br>8: 000000000040021d 83 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall5<br>9: 00000000004012d8 8 OBJECT GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _D4test9SYS_WRITEyl<br>10: 00000000004001a7 51 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall2<br>11: 00000000004000b0 47 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 write<br>12: 0000000000400162 37 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 _start<br>13: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 __bss_start<br>14: 00000000004001da 67 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall4<br>15: 0000000000400137 43 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 1 syscall1<br>16: 00000000004012e8 0 NOTYPE GLOBAL DEFAULT 3 _edata<br>17: …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Use this template to ask the user interview questions that drive product and marketing decisions. </p><div><div><p><strong>Who this is for:</strong> Founders, product managers, and UX researchers conducting user research to guide the development of new or improved products.</p>
<p><strong>Why this exists:</strong> Too frequently I see founders and product managers start with a solution and then ask for feedback on it (UX researchers tend to get this right). This doesn’t work. As one user interviewee told me recently, “When I first conducted user interviews all I learned was that everyone loves your product if you ask stupid questions”. </p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>Download the template I start with when creating questions for a new set of user interviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t15p0nh3y83f/CeL5x9np6vyuBk73RwAV3/afb00c3a7580ec049bd72011a9bcbf19/user_interview_template.xlsx">User interview template</a></p>
<h2>Filled-Out Example</h2>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/t15p0nh3y83f/20Z7GcDwGyHeUK8D1ZQafZ/892c2c0baaa8e7d591788a0f198931cf/example_user_interview_notes.xlsx">Download this example to see what my notes look like for a typical user interview.</a></p>
<h2>How I Use The Template For User Interviews</h2>
<p>Here’s how I break up a 30-minute user interview:</p>
<p><strong>1. Background and rapport-building [5 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>A successful qualitative user interview should be sincere, vivid, and emotional. To achieve all three of these you need to build a solid foundation with your interviewee. When I'm on the other end of user interviews, I can always tell how experienced the interviewer is by how much they ask about me at the beginning. Experts spend more time getting to know me. We do this to build rapport and understand more about the segment we’re interviewing. For example, in my research, I’ve found that the role of a product manager varies so much between a large and small firms that they’re two completely different segments. Another thing I try to do is earn confidence from the interviewee by proving that I’m well prepared. For example, if I see that the user recently switched roles, or we have a shared connection or interest, I’ll sneak that into this portion.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Nothing. Don't skip this part. You’re about walk the tightrope between interrogation and interview; if you don’t build rapport early on, you’ll plummet into interrogation territory.</p>
<p>Do ask: Can you tell me a little about your role as a Product Manager at Acme Group?</p>
<p><strong>2. Detailed story-collecting questions [20 minutes] </strong></p>
<p>A successful user interview is one where you, as the interviewer, walk away with a collection of vivid stories. As humans, we don’t recognize issues until we talk about specific scenarios and we tend to be terrible at predicting how we will respond to future scenarios. The key to parseing these out is the follow-up questions you ask. One rule of thumb I use is the rule of five whys; try following up a user’s response with “why” until you’ve reached the core of a problem. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: What problems do you encounter when you do x?</p>
<p>Do ask: Tell me about the last time you did x.</p>
<p><strong>3. Product questions [3 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>Once I’ve collected some stories, if I have time, I’ll spend a few minutes describing the hypothesized product and asking questions about it. One of the best things you can do here is to parse out the expectations from the customer; that’s where the gold is. For example, I’ll give a somewhat vague description of the product, and the customer will say, “so does the thing do y”? Which is the perfect time to ask, “would you like it to do y? Why?” Another great question is, “what did you expect?” For example, a user sent me the following email the other day, “I signed up but I’m not quite sure if I was doing it correctly?” My response: “May I ask a question? What did you expect to see that you didn’t?” Turns out, the user expected to see a note that they would get notified when they got a match. During this portion, I'll usually ask questions on a one to ten scale because it forces the customer to examine why they gave a certain rating to something and parses out their hesitations to use the product. </p>
<p>Don’t ask: The product does x, would you use it?</p>
<p>Do ask: On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) how likely would you be to use the product? Why? On a scale of 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely), how likely would you be to use the product if it did x? Why?</p>
<p><strong>4. Flywheel-building questions [2 minutes]</strong></p>
<p>By now you’ve built rapport, have some user stories, and the user has a sense of what you’re working on. My favorite questions to ask here are: is there anything I haven’t asked that you think I should be asking? And: do you have any other concerns that we haven’t already talked about? On average, two out of eight respondents will have a question here; when they do it is usually gold because it uncovers something huge that I’ve neglected. Finally, I ask if there’s anyone else that I should be interviewing. This question helps open our blinders to new segments and sometimes leads to a referral for the next user interview.</p>
<p>Don’t ask: Anything else?</p>
<p>Do ask: Is there anything I haven’t asked that I should be asking? Do you have any concerns that haven’t been brought up yet? Is there anyone else that you think I should be interviewing for this research?</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, I discuss how to conduct a user interview in the blog post, <a href="https://www.userinterviewexchange.com/blog/how-to-conduct-qualitative-user-interviews">How To Conduct Qualitative User Interviews For Customer Discovery</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp">Headlamp</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a> of our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget">Inspektor Gadget</a> project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_no_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions">
<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our <a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska">Nebraska</a> project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s <a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant">Octant</a> project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the <a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash">K8dash</a> project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, <a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive">Lokomotive</a>. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy to try out Headlamp</strong>: just apply the deployment manifest to your cluster and point your browser to the Headlamp service, or download and install the desktop application for Windows, Mac, or Linux. For details, see the <a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Headlamp is fully open source, released under the Apache 2.0 terms and, as mentioned above, we created it to be a generic and vendor-independent Kubernetes UI that we hope can suit many use-cases. So we encourage anyone interested to take part.</p>
<p>If you want to participate, please check out our <a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We hope you enjoy Headlamp!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bland målen för amerikanska NSA:s avlyssning fanns Saab och den danska försvarskoncernen Terma. Enligt uppgifter till DR, från flera av varandra oberoende källor med insyn i granskningen av den pågående avlyssningsskandalen i Danmark, har NSA fått tillgång till fiberoptiska kablar och ett datacenter på Amager söder om Köpenhamn. Därifrån har man avlyssnat holländsk, norsk, fransk och tysk datatrafik, danska politiska institutioner och svenska försvarsintressen.</p><p>Flera källor pekar ut det svenska Gripen-programmet som ett av målen.</p><h4>Danmark upphandlade nya stridsflyg</h4><p>Det amerikanska spionaget ska, enligt Danmarks radios källor, ha skett samtidigt som den danska staten upphandlade nya stridsflygplan – där Saabs Gripen-plan var med i slutstriden. Danska staten köpte till sist 27 amerikanska F-35-stridsflygplan.</p><p>Danmarks radio har vare sig kunnat styrka eller avfärda att avlyssningen hade ett samband med mångmiljardaffären, detsamma gäller frågan huruvida någon känslig information har röjts. Men enligt experter som SVT och DR talat med kan det röra sig om ekonomiska motiv.</p><h4>Visselblåsare slog larm</h4><p>Den danska skandalen inleddes med att en anställd på FE upptäckte att NSA bedrev olagligt spioneri genom det dansk-amerikanska underrättelsesamarbetet. Efter flera misslyckade försök att uppmärksamma FE:s ledning på problematiken larmade visselblåsaren FE:s tillsynsmyndighet TET.</p><p><span>Myndigheten inledde en undersökning som resulterade i en fyra pärmar tjock rapport. </span><br><span>Materialet från visselblåsaren indikerar, enligt tillsynsmyndigheten TET:s pressmeddelande, att FE:s ledning ”underlåtit att följa upp eller närmare undersöka indikationer på spionage”. Den danska försvarsministern Trine Bramsen tvingade fem personer i FE:s ledning att lämna sina uppdrag.</span></p><h4>Sofistikerad programvara</h4><p>NSA hade fått tillgång till internationella fiberkablar som löper in och ut ur Danmark till bland annat Sverige, USA, England och Tyskland. Kablarna är nyckel i den storskaliga avlyssning som USA och deras allierade bedriver.</p><p>Enligt Danmarks radio har NSA på danska Amager under perioden 2012-2014 upprättat ett datacenter som använder systemet XKeyscore, avslöjat 2013 av Edward Snowden, en central funktion i hela NSA:s avlyssningsapparat. Programmet gör det möjligt att gå igenom stora datamängder i fiberkablar med hjälp av ”selektorer” – sökord som namn på personer i central ställning i intressanta organisationer.</p><p>Enligt källorna fanns selektorer direkt riktade mot Gripenprogrammet och andra försvarsindustriella objekt.</p><p>SVT har i flera omgångar varit i kontakt med Saab som vid ett första möte menade att spionaget inte var anmärkningsvärt och var då beredda att ställa upp på en intervju.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steve McConnell, has a great summary of existing studies that support the 10x theory in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-10x/">“Individual Productivity Variation in Software Development”</a>. </li>
<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415178">“Leadership, Team Building, and Team Member Characteristics in High Performance Project Teams”</a> the authors identify 9 themes<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> as potential predictors of team performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415147">“Linking Project Team Performance with Team Health”</a> the authors emphasize that team building is a long term strategy that does not happen overnight by itself. Organizations must invest if they want to build healthy, high performing teams.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1999.11415013">“An Empirical Study of the Relationship Between Team Performance and Team Maturity”</a> the authors measure the impact of changes in team dynamics, and make a correlation of team maturity with high performance teams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>NEW YORK -- 
	Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax: executives at several American laboratories developing COVID-19 vaccines have recently pocketed millions of dollars by selling shares in their companies -- raising questions about the propriety of such a move in the midst of a global health crisis.</p>
<p>
	On the very day that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced preliminary data showing its vaccine was 90 per cent effective against the coronavirus, its chief executive Albert Bourla sold shares worth US$5.6 million.</p>
<p>
	There was nothing illegal about this, Pfizer said: the sale took place according to rules allowing company heads to sell shares under predetermined criteria, at a date or for a price set in advance, to avoid any suspicion of insider training.</p>
<p>
	Under the same rules, several Moderna officials have sold shares worth more than $100 million in recent months.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	That company has not placed a single product on the market since its creation in 2010, but the federal government has committed to paying it up to $2.5 billion if its vaccine proves effective.</p>
<p>
	Moderna shares have soared from $19 at the beginning of the year to a current level of $90.</p>
<p>
	The boss of Novavax, for his part, sold $4.2 million in shares on August 18, just over a month after the announcement it would receive public financing of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>
	Accountable US, a nonpartisan taxpayers' advocacy group, has calculated that from the start of the federally coordinated effort to develop vaccines on May 15 until Aug. 31, officials at five pharmaceutical companies made more than $145 million by selling shares.</p>
<h3>
	'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE'</h3>
<p>
	Executives at Pfizer and Moderna were operating under a rule put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to allow company employees to sell shares without facing insider-trading charges.</p>
<p>
	It allows them to set up a plan determining the trades of their shares at a price, amount or dates specified in advance, but only when they are not in possession of privileged information that could affect share prices.</p>
<p>
	Once such a sale is planned, it cannot be modified at the last minute, even if its timing might ultimately raise questions.</p>
<p>
	Still, this use of the rule by Pfizer and Moderna appears "legally questionable," according to Daniel Taylor, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, who has been studying the big pharma firms since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>
	"The question is, what did the executives know at the time that they pre-scheduled the trade?" he asked.</p>
<p>
	Bourla, according to Pfizer, had merely re-authorized on Aug. 19 a plan for a share sale originally authorized in February, "with the same price and volume terms."</p>
<p>
	But a day after that, the company issued a statement describing the preliminary results of its clinical trials as "positive."</p>
<h3>
	'LEVEL PLAYING FIELD'</h3>
<p>
	It is of course not just normal but desirable that laboratory heads should be encouraged to develop a safe and reliable vaccine as quickly as possible, Taylor said.</p>
<p>
	But "when they are going to sell their shares, they have to make sure that they are operating by the same level playing field, that they're not taking advantage of other investors by having more information," he said.</p>
<p>
	Taylor added a word of caution: "I don't think that companies have internalized the reputational risk to these trades" by selling shares even as COVID-19 cases have been spiraling upward around the world.</p>
<p>
	When a top executive needs to sell shares to pay for a yacht, a new house or his children's education, the public rarely is aware of it. But with the pandemic raging, the laboratories are under intense scrutiny.</p>
<h3>
	HONESTY WITH INVESTORS</h3>
<p>
	For Sanjai Bhagat, a professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who specializes in corporate governance, top executives should simply not be allowed to sell company shares until a year or two after they leave the company.</p>
<p>
	"If they have a lot of vested stock and stock options, then they have an incentive to get the share price as high as they can, even by not being totally honest with the investing public," he said.</p>
<p>
	Bhagat believes corporate boards should eliminate any chance of temptation.</p>
<p>
	"Not having done anything illegal is not the standard by which they should be judged," he said. "Especially in these times, people are expecting them to act responsibly."</p>
<p>
	Contacted by AFP, the SEC would not say whether it was investigating any of the lab executives.</p>
<p>
	But in an interview in May on the CNBC network, SEC chairman Jay Clayton exhorted executives to respect best practices.</p>
<p>
	"Why would you want to even raise the question that you were doing something that was inappropriate?" he asked.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Add some attitude to your console statement with the <code>%c</code> specifier 👩‍🎨 This is super handy to help you easily identify debug information from the console 👾</p> <p>Especially if you have a huge application where there are tons of logs being printed out in the browser console. Styling your log message will make sure those important messages don't get buried 👍</p> <p>Or use it like Facebook to tell people to stay away. Next time you visit their site, open up the Developer Tools, you will see a large "Stop!" message in the console.

								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>“healthy perfectionism: a personality trait that’s associated with finding enjoyment and even fulfillment in life from doing things as well as you possibly can. It’s generally considered a beneficial trait that’s linked with being more conscientious and self-disciplined.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
<li><span>Margaret uses a quote from Brené Brown’s book </span><i><span>The Gifts of Imperfection</span></i><span> explaining the dark side of perfectionism: “a self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought: if I look perfect, live perfectly, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.”</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“This form of perfectionism, which is fuelled by inner shame that must be quelled, involves trying to constantly meet perceived expectations of what ‘perfect’ is. This perfectionism isn’t fulfilling and it’s far from enjoyable. Yet many people feel it’s mandatory to look as if all is perfect. They believe that not to do so would imply imperfection.” — Margaret Rutherford.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>The dark side of perfectionism is called destructive perfectionism. These perfectionists might not recognize themselves as perfectionists. They don’t believe their best is good enough.</span></li>
<li><span>Margaret recommends 5 stages that can help with unhealthy perfectionism: </span></li>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Consciousness</i></b>: becoming aware that your perfectionism is a problem in the first place. “…this stage might be especially complicated for you because you’ve convinced yourself that your perfectionist traits are normal or not a problem.” — Margaret Rutherford</li>
<li><b><i>Commitment</i></b><span>: understanding that substituting commitment with intention is perfectly fine. It’s a process. Be intentional.</span></li>
<li><b><i>Confrontation</i></b><span>: think about the rules you set for yourself and how your beliefs influence them. “…without even realizing it – what you consider is allowed or disallowed, what you should do, must not do, always need to do, never should do. They’re in your head all the time.” — Margaret Rutherford&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b><i>Connection</i></b><span>: ”if you don’t connect with and process your emotional hurt, anger or sadness, it will govern your life in ways that you can’t see – you’ll end up blindly living it.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
<li><b><i>Change</i></b><span>: “where your hope comes from is through changing your behavior – that is, seeing positive results from the efforts you’re making.” — Margaret Rutherford</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>“…the hardest work isn’t making a change; it’s maintaining it. There are so many pulls and tugs from that perfectionistic shaming voice that holding on to a fresh perspective and behavior can be challenging. But it can happen; it simply takes practice. And lots of it.” — Margaret Rutherford.</li>
</ul>

								<p><span>A quote Margaret used was “healing is a process, not a destination.” That hits deep. There’s no magic switch to turn off your health issues. It’s a process. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our new series, Product Thinking! We'll be featuring regular interviews with super-sharp product managers, leaders and thinkers from a huge range of companies. Know someone who you think we should interview? Drop us a line!</p><p>We're stoked to be kicking the series off with an interview with <strong>Den Delimarsky, Principle Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.</strong></p><h2><strong>Hey Den! Tell us more about your background. What have you worked on in the past, and how'd you end up in your current role? What drew you to product work?</strong></h2><p>I grew up always wanting to work in the IT industry&nbsp;in some shape or form, but when I thought about it, it was largely around the software engineering discipline. That is — I had no idea in my high school days that a product management track was even an option. Once I got into the computer science program during my college days, I discovered that there was such a thing as PM. I wrote about it&nbsp;<a href="https://den.dev/blog/pm/" target="_blank">in my blog</a>&nbsp;— it was entirely an accident. However, once I discovered that product management is a thing, it was easily the best decision in my life to pursue this career path. The first steps of me being a product manager happened in early 2013, when I was part of a team at Microsoft that was called Home Activities &amp; Experiences (HAX). As a PM intern, I was responsible for helping bring to market an innovative calendar planning solution. I loved the kind of work I could put into the discovery phases, customer interviews, and then be able to see the ideas take shape in close collaboration with my engineering peers. In broad terms, product management combined two of my favorite things — talking to people and the magic of software. Since then, I've worked on the team that shipped Outlook Desktop and Office 365 Groups, after which I jumped on the opportunity to build&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">docs.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;from scratch, being one of the first PMs on the project. My latest gig was with Amazon, where I helped build parts of the EventBridge service. What I love about being a product manager, and what reaffirms that I made the decision on a daily basis is the sheer scope of work that I get to do — it's practically unlimited. I get to do everything, from talking to people who use the product I am building, to crunching numbers, and mocking up new experience designs.</p><h2><strong>What are the unique challenges you're facing in your role right now?</strong></h2><p>The challenges are not typical to my role, but likely are typical to the times we're in right now. COVID-19 has shown us that we'll need to adapt to a world with stressors that many of us have not seen before. Folks with kids, homeschooling, travel restrictions — these significantly impact our ability to focus and concentrate on building. The situation that we are in right now requires a degree of empathy from our leaders and peers — not everything will get done the way we planned early in the year. Availability of individuals may shift. Attitudes may shift. We all need to be cognizant of these factors. As one of my mentors says, "<em>we're not working remotely. We are working remotely during a global pandemic.</em>" This is not your typical 'work from home' environment.</p><h2><strong>What is your unique ability that has allowed you to succeed in product roles?</strong></h2><p>Skill stacking. Something that I've learned from my good friend and mentor&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/danielfe" target="_blank">Dan Fernandez</a>.The idea behind this is fairly simple — generalization instead of super-specialization. I tend to combine a set of skills to get the job done. For example, I love writing code and working with data. This enabled me to leverage those skills in my career and help me be more efficient with my and my team's time. With code, I am able to quickly put together product prototypes or help unblock the engineering team when they have too much on their plate. I recall in 2017, when my team was tasked with building some documentation infrastructure, one of the tools that needed to be built was temporarily deprioritized. I knew we had a tight deadline ahead, so I rolled my sleeves and wrote the tool myself. As far as I am aware, it's still in production&nbsp;<span>today</span>. Being able to wrangle data and discern meaningful insights from those that are irrelevant helped me quickly make decisions and settle arguments without having to be bottlenecked by the data science team, since their resources are scarce and likely already spread fairly thin. Notice how I don't say that I will do the work of the data science or engineering teams — they do extensive work, and are vastly more experienced in their domains than I am. I am pretty sure if they looked at some of my original code, they'd be horrified. However, it enables me to move fast and help my team deliver value to customers regularly. To all the folks that I mentor, I always recommend exploring some adjacent fields. Do you like user experience design? Are you a great orator? Do you have a knack for putting together great video reels? Put those skills to use. A product manager who only knows how to talk to customers and write a spec is silo-ed. A product manager who knows how to talk to customers, write a spec, put that into a Figma prototype, and pull the quantitative data to prove or disprove their product hypotheses is a force of nature.</p><h2><strong>What's one thing you've worked on that you're really proud of?</strong></h2><p>Hard to pinpoint just one thing, to be honest. I've been fortunate to work with really talented individuals in every team that I've been a part of, and we delivered great products. I'd say the most impactful product that I've been a part of was&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">docs.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;— the technical documentation site for Microsoft. It's an absolutely massive project, with hundreds of stakeholders within the company, and millions of stakeholders outside it. I joined the team in 2015, in the very early planning stages of the site. It was exciting to build something modern, scalable, and with global reach, while considering the legacy of resources such as the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) and TechNet. We completely upended the traditional technical documentation model. No more proprietary systems — it's all on GitHub and written in Markdown. There are multiple modalities that allow you to discover every single API that Microsoft ships for a language, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/" target="_blank">Python API Browser</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/" target="_blank">.NET API Browser</a>. We've built an entirely new experience to aggregate all code samples that Microsoft ships in the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/" target="_blank">samples browser</a>. And of course I can't neglect mentioning&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;— the service that allows anyone around the globe to get skilled in a variety of technologies, entirely for free. Working as part of the team that delivered all this is what I am most proud of.</p><h2><strong>How do you foster collaboration within your team? Any tools or processes that are working really well this year?</strong></h2><p>I am taking a bit of an unorthodox approach here. As someone who worked remotely for the past 4 years, I can confidently say that tools themselves are just that — tools. They don't matter as much as the underlying collaboration culture. You can have fantastic video chat software, but if the culture is not there to work asynchronously, it's not going to help you or your team. One of the things that I try reiterating to my team is that just because we are now not in the office doesn't mean that we need to shift every meeting that we ever had into an online environment. Quite the opposite — this is an opportunity to reevaluate what meetings are really necessary, and where we need to start working offline. It all starts with culture where the team understands the value of not being constantly interrupted by Slack notifications, emails, and Zoom calls. To that extent, to me collaboration means that I show how my team can focus and work when they allocate time for it. I really like the approach that&nbsp;<a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate" target="_blank">Basecamp&nbsp;</a>is taking here — they are THE company that knows how to do distributed work right. One of the points that stuck with me, that I see a lot of teams fail at, is the fact that communication is not tied to calendars. Way too often we wait for "<em>time to sync</em>" or "<em>discuss during the planning meeting.</em>" That's a completely unnecessary roadblock. Why not write a one page document that outlines the pros and cons of an issue, and I will get back with feedback when I have time, if it's not urgent. Or write an email, and I will respond with some thoughts whenever I am not focused on writing the product vision outline. The best way to collaborate is to build enough flex in your process that accounts for everyone's work styles and time allocations. And of course, meetings does not mean collaboration. As a matter of fact, meetings are generally the opposite of that. The more meetings your team has, the more their focus is destroyed. For the love of everything, please stop making everything a meeting and give people space to think through a problem and come up with some thoughtful input.</p><h2><strong>What's unique about your product/development team culture at AWS?</strong></h2><p><em>I will skip this question because as of last week, I am no longer at AWS, and am transitioning to a different company.</em></p><h2><strong>How do you manage prioritization and roadmapping?</strong></h2><p>This will vary between teams, but I like to keep it very simple. The inputs that I look at are:</p><ol><li><strong>Quantitative data</strong>. Do we have any numbers that point us towards the importance of certain things?</li><li><strong>Qualitative data</strong>. Do we have any verbal/written feedback that&nbsp;points us towards the importance of certain things?</li><li><strong>Emerging/established trends</strong>. Are there any specific movements that we see in the space that we need to make sure we are part of?</li><li><strong>Unknown unknowns</strong>. Are there any new opportunities that are not yet understood/seen by others that we can be a part of?</li></ol><p>Once you have reliable data on the above (and getting truly reliable data is hard and is what needs a lot of focus from product managers and their organizations), roadmapping and prioritization becomes easy, because one can clearly see where they can deliver the most value to the customers and the market. Whether it's then put in a JIRA board, or Trello, or whether story points are assigned to each item …</p></div></div>

<p>Many people think creativity is an innate talent, when in reality it is an acquired skill.</p>



<p>It is a skill, though, that we all develop naturally in our childhood. And that most of us lose after our first years in school (since they didn’t know how to measure it, they figured it wasn’t important enough to have it in the curriculum).</p>



<p>Good news is your creativity is not lost for good. It’s not dead. <strong>It’s just numb, like an atrophied muscle</strong>. To bring it back, you need two things:</p>



<ol><li>A growth mindset</li><li>A lot of reps</li></ol>



<p>Having a growth mindset is key, because otherwise you won’t feel compelled to put it in the reps. <strong>You need to believe you are and can be creative</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve talked yourself into that, the rest is simple. You just need to show up and practice. Every. Single. Day.</p>



<p><strong>We are what we repeatedly do. Creativity, then, is not an act, it’s a habit.</strong></p>

Thought begets thought, and if you allow it to compound enough, it becomes an engine of innovation that produces all kinds of magical things.</p><p>There is no end to this march of human thought, as it transcends even death itself. The moment one node dies, many others will learn from the ideas of that node, and those thoughts form the foundation of further ideas to come. This is why the words of dead poets, politicians, and philosophers grow increasingly influential as time runs its course. As Dostoyevsky writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>People are always saved after the death of him who saved them.</em></p></blockquote><p>This endlessly growing web of thought has produced many brilliant things, but perhaps the greatest impact it has had on the material world comes in the form of technology. All it takes is one look at your immediate surroundings to see evidence of this.</p><p>Almost everything you can touch was once a cutting-edge invention. For example, imagine the first person that was given a cup to drink from. That must have blown his mind with the force of a million supernovas.<span title="Below is More To That’s first ever animation, which won’t be as mind-blowing, but hopefully is an enjoyable thing to experience.">1</span></p><p>In this case, we were using a simple cup, but whether it’s a cup, couch, lamp, or laptop, every material product shares two common threads:</p><p>(1) It was created using resources from the natural world, and</p><p>(2) It was created to serve some human function.</p><p>Thought is the tool that allows both conditions to be satisfied. It is only through logistical ingenuity that we are able to extract materials out of the Earth, piece them together, and imbue the result with the attributes necessary to create an iPhone. And it is only through curiosity and creativity where the desire to build a machine like this can come about in the first place.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-right-side-of-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the utility of thought shines</a>. The fact that smart people all around the world are contributing a seemingly endless stream of ideas and insight is what powers technological growth. In this case, the always-on nature of the mind is a key feature of our species, creating products that hopefully increase well-being with each release.</p><p>However, we are all aware of the dark side of this progress as well.</p><p>If Condition #1 is taken to its logical endpoint, then we will view the natural world primarily for its utility, rather than for its sheer beauty. Martin Heidegger calls this the “standing reserve,” where nature is nothing but a reservoir for us to draw upon to make more shit. We will destroy acres of the forest to make a few more chairs. Ruin fertile soil to find petroleum. Countless hours of manpower and thought will be allocated to this effort, searching for the marginal value one can get from destroying just a bit more.</p><p>If Condition #2 is taken to its logical endpoint, then things look even bleaker. If everything we touch in the material world has to serve some sort of function, isn’t it only a matter of time before humans themselves have to serve some sort of greater function as well? After all, we’re all a part of the material world too, right?</p><p>Inherent in any technological advancement is the need for deeply laborious work, ironically to create products that make life easier for its users. Humans and their ability to think become the source for labor, and it is commonly believed that this reduces people to mere task-completing drones, voiding them of any unique personalities or characteristics.</p><p>We’ve heard this argument ever since the industrialized era, where rows of people were set up on assembly lines, doing the same physical task over and over again until they went home to relax.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png" alt="assembly line drawing" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/B01-Assembly-line-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>We’ve heard this argument in the era of offices, where rows of people were set up in cubicles, doing <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the same cognitive task over and over again</a> until they went home to relax.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png" alt="row of cubicles - cubicle farm" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/C01-Cubicles-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In both scenarios, however, labor and leisure were delineated by physical space. If you were situated within the four walls of your factory or office, it was time to work. If you found yourself within the four walls of your home, it was time to relax. The mind was able to shift gears based on obvious environmental cues, and this delineation created some form of segmentation in one’s work and leisure life.</p><p>To say that things have changed would be the <a href="https://moretothat.com/finding-peace-within-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understatement of the year</a>.</p><p>Many people are now seeing how technological progress has enabled a world where work can be divorced from the office, and married to the home. We may have understood this in theory before, but now we have been forced to see it in action. And for the most part, the technological infrastructure has been sound enough to support this shift at a fairly astonishing scale.</p><p>However, through this move, the age-old physical barrier between work and rest has all but dissolved. We wake up, work, wind down, and sleep within the same four walls that used to serve solely as a haven of rest and recharge. The home is no longer an environmental cue to put work aside. It is a place that constantly reminds you that there is always more work to be done.</p><p>We are now living amidst <span><strong>the omnipresence of work</strong></span>. Even if we aren’t sitting down working, we are prone to continue thinking about it since the physical environment no longer reminds us to shift our mind state. In addition, the always-on nature of our tools means that we are perpetually reachable, as our phones contain the inboxes and schedules of both our personal and professional lives. The question “are you available?” is not really an inquiry about one’s availability, but more so about whether or not one feels like taking that call.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D01-Phone-available-for-a-chat-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png" alt="hanging out at home and looking at phone" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/D02-E-Hanging-out-at-the-couch-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D03-Kinda-busy-now-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Availability is no longer determined by one’s time, but by one’s attention. The problem, of course, is that our attention is constantly absorbed by the tools we use everyday, making us feel like we’re never truly available. As these tools continue to get nicer, prettier, and more powerful, it becomes increasingly difficult to stop checking them, which further blurs the lines between work and leisure.</p><p>I remember when it wasn’t always like this.</p><p>Over a decade ago, I had a summer internship where we were all given a Blackberry. This was before the iPhone was a household product, and this bulky-ass, hideous thing was the best option companies had to email their employees when they were out of the office.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png" alt="old Blackberry design - drawing" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F01-Blackberry-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The running joke was that we now had a “leash” that kept us tethered to the whims of our bosses. We heard countless stories about employees enjoying a night out on Friday, only to be pinged by their associate telling them to come into the office to work on a terrible Powerpoint presentation.<span title="It was an investment banking internship, where this kind of foolishness was not just tolerated, but perpetuated.">2</span></p><p>The Blackberry is now a laughable artifact of the early 2000s, but the underlying reason for its existence is more relevant than ever.</p><p>Technological progress in the era of knowledge work can be defined by these three things:</p><p>(1) Make it easier to connect with others,</p><p>(2) Make it faster to get what you need,</p><p>(3) Make it pretty and appealing.</p><p>The Blackberry did a somewhat decent job at #1 and #2, but it did a terrible job at #3. Even by early 21st century standards, it was a hideous piece of design, and whenever I used it, it reminded me that this tool was definitely for work, and not for play.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png" alt="old Blackberry - checking in on employee" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/F02-Blackberry-and-Work-v2-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fast forward to 2020, and things are different. We now have a ton of beautifully designed, amazing tools that allow you to work from anywhere, to reach anyone at any time, and to check on your individual progress and goals. Messaging apps and note-taking tools are multi-billion dollar industries, all of which are defined by their ease of use and their aesthetic appeal.</p><p>Work has successfully wrapped itself around shiny toys, all of which are housed in an even shinier phone. Whereas my old Blackberry was an unwilling leash handed out to me and my colleagues, the tools of today are gladly accepted and used by people all around the world. We willingly tether ourselves to the constant demands of the workplace, either by actively working on our projects during the day, or by passively checking on their progress at night.</p><p>This then begs the question:</p><p><span><strong>Amidst the omnipresence of work, can our minds ever stop identifying with the constant need to produce?</strong></span></p><p>I’m worried that the answer to this is trending toward “no.”</p><p>In my case, I’m finding it remarkably difficult to consciously shift my attention away from work and toward relaxation. It’s as if those two realms can no longer be accessed via a cognitive switch, as the mere presence of my laptop or phone can remind me to check something or queue up another article to read. I know that making some environmental changes can help here, but the existence of this tension is just another sign pointing to the omnipresence of work.</p><p>In the case of teams, I worry that all these great tools and technologies are slowly turning us into avatars of productivity, while dimming down our personalities. Communication is no longer serendipitous; it is scheduled in 30 minute increments, which is just enough for a few minutes of small talk, then an overview of what needs to get done. Work is seamlessly distributed to profile pictures on a Slack channel, then collected in pieces by some future agreed-upon date on a shared calendar.</p><p>I don’t mean to sound dystopian here, but given this dynamic, it seems inevitable that we start defining ourselves by what we’re able to produce, while everything else goes by the wayside. When Heidegger referred to nature as a “standing reserve” of resources awaiting our usage, it feels like we’re beginning to view ourselves this way as well. We delude ourselves into thinking that the products of our labor are what makes us useful and needed, while things like friendship and love are “nice-to-have”s or “I’ll-get-to-it-when-my-career-has-taken-off” afterthoughts.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png" alt="the omnipresence of work - continuing to think about work" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/G01-Work-and-Everything-Else-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The thing is, we all <em>know</em> that work isn’t everything, but the way we spend our attention suggests otherwise.

                            <div>
                            <p>A few weeks ago something happened that wouldn't change how a small company in Vienna thinks about security: <strong>My windshield cracked</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/zeceif.jpg"><figcaption>Cracked Windshield on my 2001 Ford Focus</figcaption></figure>
<p>I just had it changed less than 6 months ago and it cracked again. Since I didn't want to pay the 300€ again I googled for cheaper alternatives and found a small car parts seller in Vienna that had my windshield for just 98€</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/9qbu9j.jpg"><figcaption>Site of the car shop</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I was browsing for my new windshield and other parts I saw that some images didn't load right so I checked the console in my browser and saw that my ad blocker just blocked some piwik (now matamo) tracking script from another domain.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/ewlo4h.png"><figcaption>JS console of the site, blocking piwik</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to be sure I disabled the ad blocker and reloaded the site to see if anything changed.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/afypz7.png"><figcaption>New error message</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hmm.. interesting.. the site seems to have some error and the tracking script can't be loaded.</p>
<p>Or.. could it be..</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/fjtedv.png"><figcaption>Yep, the site isn't even registered anymore</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sooo.. I bought the domain netdiscoverer.eu and now this site (and it turns out a whole bunch of others) are loading scripts from my domain.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/di2vhn.png"><figcaption>Standard piwik code inclusion on the car shop's website</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now if somebody would be childish and would put these lines of code in a file called piwik.js the site would suddenly change.</p>
<pre><code>document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red"
var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
for(var i=0, l=imgs.length;i&lt;l;i++){
    imgs[i].src = "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KL7d7LdSANg/Tm5VLQf9k4I/AAAAAAAAACo/cSV52JoD7vk/s1600/cat-wallpaper-34-713472.jpg";
    };
alert("Please fix this site");</code></pre>
<p>And would look a bit different</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/mq9x3t.png"><figcaption>Bad code makes site look even worse</figcaption></figure>
<p>But since I'm a responsible IT security person I didn't do that.</p>

<p>In order to buy the windshield I had to make a down payment via their website. They have a button "Paypal down payment" where customers have to click which sends them to a paypal.me site where they have to pay and put their phone number to be called back.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/82knw7.jpg"><figcaption>PayPal site you get redirected to when you click the "Down payment" button</figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh boy anyone could have bought the netdiscoverer domain and redirected users to another site to pay. Glad I found it before anyone else did.</p>
<p>So I make the down payment, they call me back, I drive to their shop to pick it up and have a whole speech prepared about the importance of IT security and how to find good people to maintain websites, etc but reality got me off guard.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/4fnesz.jpg"><figcaption>My new windshield in their shop!</figcaption></figure>
<p>I talked to the mechanic, gave them the rest of the money, they gave me the windshield and then I asked who was in charge of their website.
He said it was their "IT freak" but he wasn't around.</p>
<p>I asked if I could get the phone number of the person in charge or if he could get them on the phone for me because their website has a massive flaw but it's easy to fix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So you hacked us? No, I won't give you the number."</p>
<p>-Mechanic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said he won't give me the number of their IT person so I left my card and said it's very urgent, they should call me ASAP.</p>
<p>I packed my windshield and drove off slightly annoyed in their reaction.</p>
<p>Half a month later I still didn't get that call and their site is still loading scripts form my servers. You thought the 8th word in my first sentence of this post was a typo? Nope, this country (Austria) doesn't have any kind of urgency when it comes to IT security. I have learned that a few times already.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/9diz1s.jpg"><figcaption>But at least my Focus has a new windshield</figcaption></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent">
				<p>This post concludes my introduction to the chrono extension in C++20. Today I present the time-zones functionality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="278"></p>
<p>I should have written, today I mainly present the time-zones functionality in C++20. Before I write about the time-zones in C++20, I want to present the online resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes </a>from Howard Hinnant, which has about 40 examples of the new chrono functionality. Presumably, the chrono extension in C++20 is not easy to get; therefore it's quite important to have so many examples. You should use these examples as a starting point for further experiments and, therefore, sharpen your understanding. You can also add your recipes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a> I want to present a program for<a href="https://github.com/rbock"> Roland Bock</a> that calculates ordinal dates.</p>
<h2 id="h1-calculating-ordinal-dates">Calculating Ordinal Dates</h2>
<p>"<em>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date" rel="nofollow">ordinal date</a> consists of a year and a day of year (1st of January being day 1, 31st of December being day 365 or day 366). The year can be obtained directly from year_month_day. And calculating the day is wonderfully easy. In the code below we make us of the fact that year_month_day can deal with invalid dates like the 0th of January</em>:" (Roland Bock)</p>
<p>I added the necessary headers to Roland's program.</p>

<div>
<pre><span>// ordinalDate.cpp</span>

<span>#include "date.h"</span>
<span>#include &lt;iomanip&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>()

   <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> year_day <span>=</span> daypoint <span>-</span> sys_days{year<span>/</span>January<span>/</span><span>0</span>}; <span>// (2)</span> 
                                                              <span>// (3)</span>
   std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> year <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'-'</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>setfill(<span>'0'</span>) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>setw(<span>3</span>) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> year_day.count() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
   
   <span>// inverse calculation and check</span>
   assert(ymd <span>==</span> year_month_day{sys_days{year<span>/</span>January<span>/</span><span>0</span>} <span>+</span> year_day});
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>I want to add a few remarks to the program. Line (1) truncates the current time point. The value is used in the following line to initialize a calendar date. Line (2) calculates the time duration between the two time points. Both time points have the resolution day. Finally, <code>year_day.count()</code> in line (3) returns the time duration in days.<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/ordinalDate2.png" alt="ordinalDate2" width="350" height="181"></p>
<p>My following examples to time-zones are also inspired by the already mentioned web resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-times-zones">Times-Zones</h2>
<p>First of all, a time-zone is a region and its full history of the date such as daylight saving time or leap seconds. The time-zone library in C++20 is a complete parser of the<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following table should give you a first idea of the new functionality.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/timeZone.png" alt="timeZone" width="600" height="277"></p>
<p>I use in my examples the function <code>std::chrono::zones_time</code> which is essentially a time-zone combined with a time point.</p>
<p>Before I show you two examples I want to make a short remark. To compile a program using the time-zone library, you have to compile the<code> tz.cpp</code> file and link against the <code>curl</code> library. The curl library is necessary to get the current <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following command line for g++ should give you the idea:</p>

<p>My first program is straightforward. It displays the UTC time and the local time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-utc-time-and-local-time">UTC Time and Local Time</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"> UTC time or Coordinated Univeral Time</a> is the primary time standard worldwide. A computer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> which is a very close approximation of UTC. The UNIX time is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.</p>
<p><code></code><code>std::chrono::system_clock::now()</code> in line (1) returns in the following program<code> localTime.cpp </code> the Unix time.<code><br></code></p>

    <span>auto</span> localTime <span>=</span> date<span>::</span>make_zoned(date<span>::</span>current_zone(), utcTime);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> localTime <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>seconds<span>&gt;</span>(localTime.get_local_time())

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  UTC offset: "</span>  <span>&lt;&lt;</span> offset <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>I have not to add too much to the program. The code block beginning with line (1) gets the current time point, truncates it to seconds, and displays it. The call<code> date::make_zoned</code> creates a <code>std::chrono::zoned_time localTime. T</code>he following call<code> localTime.get_local_time() </code>returns the stored time point as a local time. This time point is also truncated to seconds. <code>localTime</code> (line 3) can also be used to get information about the time-zone. In this case, I'm interested in the offset to the UTC time.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/localTime.png" alt="localTime" width="400" height="297"></p>
<p>My last program answers a crucial question when I teach in a different time-zone: When should I start my online class?</p>
<h3 id="h2-2-various-time-zones-for-online-classes">Various Time-Zones for Online Classes</h3>
<p>The program <code>onlineClass.cpp</code> answers the following question: How late is it in given time-zones, when I start an online class at the <code>7h, 13h,</code> or <code>17h</code> local time (Germany)?</p>
<p>The online class should start on the 1st of February 2021 and should take 4 hours. Because of the daylight saving time, the calendar date is essential to get the correct answer.</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>Before I dive into the functions<code> getMinutes</code> (line 1) and <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2), let me say a view words about the <code>main</code> function. The <code>main</code> function defines the day of the class, the duration of the class, and all time-zones. Finally, the range-based for-loop (line 3) iterates through all potential starting points for an online class. Thanks to the function <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2) all necessary information is displayed.</p>
<p>The few lines beginning with line (4) calculate the<code> startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of my training by adding the start time and the duration of the class to the calendar date. Both values are displayed with the help of the function <code>getMinutes</code> (line 1). <code>date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>minutes<span>&gt;</span>(zonedTime.get_local_time())</code> gets the stored time point out of the<code> std::chrono::zoned_time</code> and truncates the value to the minute resolution. To properly align the output of the program, line (5) <code> </code><code></code>determines the size of the longest of all time-zone names. Line (6) iterates through all time-zones and displays the name of the time-zone, and the beginning and end of each online-class. A few calendar dates even cross the day boundaries.<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/onlineClass.png" alt="onlineClass" width="600" height="760"></p>
<p>There is more to write about the extended chrono library. For example, C++20 offers new clocks such as<code> std::chrono::utc_clock</code> that include leap seconds, or the<code> std::chrono::tai_clock</code> that represents the International Atomic Time (TAI). Additional, thanks to the new formatting library in C++20, time durations can be nicely formatted. This feature is not available so far. If you want to study the formating rules for time durations, here are they: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/formatter#Format_specification">std::formatter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>If you want to compare signed and unsigned integrals, you may have a lot of fun. This fun ends with C++20.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p><time datetime="2020-11-16T19:40:14Z">Mon, Nov 16, 2020</time></p><p>A month or so ago, I ended up on on the Waze website – specifically, their “<a href="https://www.waze.com/en-GB/livemap">live map</a>".</p>
<p>As I often do, I found myself poking around Firefox’s developer tools, looking to see which API endpoints the webapp was
interacting with.</p>
<p>I noticed that this particular webapp called an which looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.waze.com/row-rtserver/web/TGeoRSS?bottom=40.73628084811186&amp;left=-74.11780357360841&amp;ma=200&amp;mj=100&amp;mu=20&amp;right=-73.85413169860841&amp;top=40.77825467049393&amp;types=alerts%2Ctraffic%2Cusers
</code></pre><p>The <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code> and <code>top</code> URL parameters are fairly self explanatory (they define the bounding box over which the
API is queried). <code>types</code> defined the data that should be included in the API call response, and <code>ma</code>, <code>mj</code>, and <code>mu</code> seemed to
specify the maximum number of alerts, jams, and users to be returned.</p>
<p>As it often does, curiosity got the better of me. I tried defining a bounding box that covered the whole planet (by setting
<code>bottom=-90</code>, <code>top=90</code>, <code>left=-180</code> and <code>right=180</code>), and just like that, the API was returning 100+mb of JSON data. This JSON
data included planet-wide user-contributed alerts (excluding the US, which uses a different API endpoint but suffered the same
problem). These alerts are user-contributed notices of traffic jams, police, broken down cars, pot holes and the like.</p>
<p><img src="https://redfern.me/images/waze-alerts.jpeg" alt="Alerts across the planet"></p>
<p>It turned out that the <code>ma</code> parameter was being ignored – users and jams were capped at the specified value (which was limited
server-side at ~300), but there was no upper bound on the number of alerts being returned.</p>
<p>This issue probably doesn’t pose an issue to users, but wasn’t the intended behaviour of the API endpoint – competitors and
other interested parties could trivially harvest all user-contributed Waze data in a single API call.</p>
<p>Waze is owned by Google, so I reported the problem to them via their <a href="https://goo.gl/vulnz">preferred channels</a>. After an initial
misunderstanding about the nature of the issue, they agreed that it was an abuse risk and decided to award a $500 bounty!</p>
<p>The timeline was:</p>
<ul>
<li>09/10/2020: reported issue to Google.</li>
<li>12/10/2020: identified as Abuse Risk.</li>
<li>20/10/2020: issue closed and not tracked as security bug due to inclusion of rate limiting, followed by subsequent
clarification that only single request was needed and rate limiting wasn’t effective in this case.</li>
<li>28/10/2020: confirmation that this was a bug and that it would be filed as such – the issue was fixed within 24hrs of this.</li>
<li>10/11/2020: notification that panel had decided to award bounty of $500 USD.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn’t a very clever bug, nor was it a very severe one. However, it goes to show that minor issues which are fairly
inconsequential to end users can still be (somewhat) valuable to Google.</p>

<p>Many people, when digging into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/" target="_blank">the PinePhone’s specs</a>,  complain about the low storage, the weak CPU, the lacklustre peripherals…</p>



<p>Naturally, they are missing the point. This is not a phone that you would buy to substitute the supercomputer/surveillance device you already carry around in your pocket. Yes, the memory is small; the pics from the camera are a bit grainy; the battery is removable and decent, but doesn’t last all that long. All this is true.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="542" src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-lazy-srcset="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg 960w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-595x336.jpg 595w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-768x434.jpg 768w, https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit.jpg 1500w" data-lazy-src="https://quickfix.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kit-960x542.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>The <em>PinePhone – KDE Community Edition with convergence package</em> (USD 199.99)  comes with a (red) cable for flashing and a dock to plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor into your phone (right). SIM and microSD cards not included.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the specs are low because the manufacturer is working with developers to provide tried-and-tested hardware. “Tried-and-tested” usually also means “old”. Developing an OS and graphical environment is a huge balancing act in which you want to reduce the number of unknowns as much as possible. So you go for what is familiar, with what has been proven to work, with what is well-documented. This usually means hardware that other manufacturers don’t care about any more and that can be safely reverse engineered, has been reverse engineered by others, or has directly had its technical specifications disclosed.</p>



<p>The aim becomes to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kde.org/announcements/pinephone-plasma-mobile-edition/" target="_blank">Plasma Mobile running on basic, well-understood hardware and then build up from there</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this <strong>is</strong> the phone you would buy if you wanted to try out one or several of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/" target="_blank">fledgling</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ubports.com/" target="_blank">Free and Open Source</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.puri.sm/Librem5/Software_Reference/Environments/Phosh.html" target="_blank">mobile</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://postmarketos.org/" target="_blank">systems</a>. The PinePhone provides you with all the tools you need to try out all and every one of them in an afternoon, making booting and flashing child’s play. Maybe it will even encourage you to help build the future of mobile, be it with code, design ideas, or just bug reports. It is a phone that fosters grassroots, community-driven contributions.</p>



<p>This is by design.</p>



<p>Once a couple things get working reliably in Plasma Mobile, it is also the phone you would buy to protect your privacy, as ALL the software is free and open and can be audited in depth. Want to not worry about spying, leaking proprietary software? This is the phone for you. Plus it even comes with physical hardware kill switches that allow you to turn off its WiFi, microphone, cameras, etc..</p>



<p>Besides, when you use this phone,  you become a proud pioneer of the FLOSS wave that will, one day, take over the mobile world; providing you with a privileged (but affordable) view into what is to come.</p>



<p>So, sure, your friends may brag about their latest iPhones, with their sharp cameras, smooth-as-butter interfaces, and crystalline sounds, while they look down on your modest PinePhone. But the walled-garden, programmed obsolescence and expensive and spying software they have to endure on  devices they don’t even get to own don’t contribute to push the envelope for a better, more humane technology, or make their owners trailblazers in any shape or form. Quite the contrary, they just make them a bunch of deluded iChumps.</p>

This is especially true for graphics meant for publication, which are held to a higher aesthetic standard. Still, most commonly used plotting software doesn't offer a straight-forward path to create clean custom layouts with nicely aligned axes.</p> <p>Therefore, the users of basically all well-known plotting solutions often have to resort to hacks, brittle manual tweaking, or even roundtrips to Illustrator to achieve the results they want. Common issues are overlaps, misalignments and lots of work to redo if the figure size ever changes.</p> <h2 id="makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy"><a href="#makielayout_makes_layouting_graphics_easy">MakieLayout Makes Layouting Graphics Easy</a></h2> <p><a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout</a> is a layout engine that attempts to solve these issues and more. It is now part of the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/">Makie plotting ecosystem</a> for the Julia language.</p> <p>Here is a totally made up example plot showing what MakieLayout can do:</p> <p><img src="https://jkrumbiegel.github.io/assets/2020-11-15-makielayout/example_1.svg" alt="Example 1"></p> <p>Among other things, this plot features a colorbar spanning two axes horizontally while aligning perfectly with a neighboring axis, and a legend describing three grids of 3x3 subplots each. The legend is placed in its own subsection instead of right next to or within any of the small subplots. The right colorbar is specifically chosen to align with the bottom content at the outer text border in order to save white-space.</p> <p>Here's a small code example which demonstrates how simple it is to place the elements of the upper half in nested grids. </p> <pre><code>scene, layout <span>=</span> <span>layoutscene</span>(resolution <span>=</span> (<span>1200</span>, <span>1000</span>))

top_grid <span>=</span> layout[<span>1</span>, <span>1</span><span>:</span><span>3</span>] <span>=</span> <span>GridLayout</span>()

Tools that do allow for static layout optimizations usually break apart under interactive conditions, when figure size changes dynamically and content has to follow.</p> <h2 id="its_grids_all_the_way_down"><a href="#its_grids_all_the_way_down">It's Grids All The Way Down</a></h2> <p>MakieLayout allows users to assemble complex graphics or interactive visualizations using flexible grids that are highly customizable for the greatest creative freedom. Elements can shrink or expand to fit the available space, and are always aligned in a visually pleasing way.</p> <p>MakieLayout doesn't just use simple table layouts like CSS, e.g., because they only work well for simple box-like elements. The restriction to boxes is the main reason why researchers often struggle to make nicely aligned graphics.</p> <p>Instead, MakieLayout extends the table concept with <em>protrusions</em>, which describe the statically sized content "sticking out" of the main elements, like axis decorations. Protrusions become part of the gaps between cell columns by default and don't count when calculating aspect ratios or relative column sizes. This makes it easy to align different subplots along their axes, but also allows for unlimited tweaking, if this default mode is not the right answer.</p> <p>Grid layouts can be nested to arbitrary levels, and can follow aspect ratio, absolute, or relative sizing. This removes the need for a whole class of hacks often used to distribute elements of different sizes in visually pleasing ways.</p> <p>Legends and colorbars in MakieLayout are first-class elements that are not tied to specific axes and can be freely placed anywhere.</p> <p>The example at the beginning involved no layout-tweaking whatsoever. Elements were simply placed in appropriately nested grids, with small aesthetic adjustments of some default settings.</p> <h2 id="interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations"><a href="#interactive_and_dynamic_visualizations">Interactive and Dynamic Visualizations</a></h2> <p>Together with the interactive Makie plotting ecosystem, axes, sliders, buttons and other widgets can be combined to easily create useful applications for data visualization and exploration. The Julia language offers very high performance so interactions are smooth and responsive.</p> <p>In this short demonstration video, you can see how elements are added to and removed from a layout dynamically. Resizing the window recalculates the layout and elements are never overlapping or otherwise misaligned. Plots can be controlled with sliders and buttons, and via a textbox, dynamically calculated function plots are added by specifying the right half of the equation in valid Julia code:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5wsl0dxGhI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe> </p> <h2 id="future_directions"><a href="#future_directions">Future Directions</a></h2> <p>As you can see, even though the Makie ecosystem is still in flux, MakieLayout can be used already to create professional and clean-looking graphics well-suited for publication. The dynamic plotting features based on Observables are easy to use and can save a lot of time when writing quick data exploration tools.</p> <p>In the future, we will focus on making the Makie ecosystem more feature complete and stable. Right now, MakieLayout has to be specifically imported, but we're planning to use it as the default infrastructure for all 2D plots, which should make using it less verbose as well. Although Makie can be compiled via PackageCompiler.jl, it is still a big goal to reduce the relatively long time to first plot, owing to the JIT compilation of Julia.</p> <p>To get started, check out the basic <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/basic-tutorial.html">Makie tutorial here</a>, and once you get the basics, have a look at the <a href="http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/makielayout/tutorial.html">MakieLayout tutorial here</a>.</p>  </div></div>]]>

            <p><em>This article was written with help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gitbisect/">Jason Yee, Director of Advocacy at Gremlin</a>. Thanks, Jason!</em></p>

<p>Developer advocacy is a way of giving software engineers a voice within your company, and helping them be successful with your product. Related disciplines include community management, which is about building a community around your product, and evangelism, which is about more deliberately promoting your product, through tools, assets, and building relationships.</p>

<p>All of these are ways of building interest that rely on deeply understanding users, building relationships with them, and constantly demonstrating how the product solves their problems. There are some specific lessons from this practice that are helpful for all marketers.</p>

<h2 id="your-audience-wants-to-be-unblocked">Your audience wants to be unblocked</h2>

<p>Your audience is trying to accomplish a task. Whether it’s an HR manager setting up rubrics for employee performance, a sales leader trying to close more deals, or a software engineer trying to solve a very specific technical problem – your audience is looking for ways to solve very specific problems.</p>

<p>The goal of developer advocacy is to unblock the work of developers. But as a marketer, you’ll do your best marketing when you think about unblocking the work of your audience.</p>

<p>What’s getting in their way, today? How does your product address those problems, specifically? And what content can you produce that will help alongside your product? For the HR manager, maybe it’s a template for performance reviews, or a guide to setting goal areas, or something else. Those assets attract visitors, and they work alongside your product to help solve your users’ problem.</p>

<h2 id="a-deep-understanding-of-your-product-is-key">A deep understanding of your product is key</h2>

<p>Someone working with developers has to have a detailed technical understanding of what it is that their product does, and how. It isn’t much use if, at a tradeshow, a technical evangelist can’t answer detailed questions about what their product does.</p>

<p>But a deep understanding of your product can be helpful to anyone in a marketing role, too. For demand generation, the specific problems of a customer can show up in search terms for paid advertising and landing page copy. For content marketing, knowing what your product does is important for generating content ideas, and then promoting them with the right language on social and other channels. Even brand marketers should have a good sense of what the product really does – if a product solves a problem by increasing ease of use, that might result in a different brand message from a solution that involves saving money or time.</p>

<p>It isn’t necessary for everyone to be able to effectively pitch, or even understand a lot of technical details. But knowing enough to develop empathy with customers can improve your marketing dramatically. Otherwise, you end up talking in vague, ineffective ways.</p>

<h2 id="being-not-sales-helps-you-close-the-sale">Being not-sales helps you close the sale</h2>

<p>A big part of marketing is building credibility over time. Most marketing tactics have this as a goal, at least indirectly. For example, advertising can make your brand seem more real, and communicate your value proposition in a memorable way. High-quality blog content conveys expertise. Even excellent design can help because it makes you appear thoughtful about your product and what it delivers.</p>

<p>Buyers know when your motivation is to close a sale, and that undermines credibility; this is particularly true when marketing to developers who are generally experts in your product’s domain.</p>

<p>It works better when someone else is involved who’s viewed as being there to educate, rather than sell. That person can accurately and honestly answer questions about whether a product will solve a specific use case, and is viewed as an educator, rather than a seller.</p>

<h2 id="documentation-makes-great-marketing">Documentation makes great marketing</h2>

<p>An often-overlooked but major driver of traffic for a lot of our clients is product documentation.</p>

<p>One obvious reason is that customers need access to documentation in order to use your product. But documentation can also be a valuable tool to reach people who are not customers yet. Documentation builds credibility by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giving visitors a sense of what it’s like to use your product. Is your documentation well-organized, easy to use, and comprehensive? Is its language and tone clear, but also warm and accessible?</li>
  <li>Showing the problems your product solves, what it can do, and what use cases it’s for – particularly if it contains wide-ranging tutorial and use case content,</li>
  <li>Explaining how your product has evolved over time, and what new features have been released.</li>
  <li>Laying out exact technical specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, documentation is viewed as critical for developer-facing products. But in fact, for all products, documentation is an opportunity to sell the product (and, by the way, increase customer satisfaction and reduce support costs.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Marketing that frustrates, annoys, or confuses prospects is extremely common and is becoming less and less effective over time. Take inspiration from advocacy and evangelism teams to keep the focus on credibility, authenticity, and value – which can help build a far more effective marketing funnel, too.</p>

        <h2 itemprop="headline">From Maybe to Ensure</h2>
        <p itemprop="about"><i>A digression on naming functions, and ensuring they only do one thing</i></p>
        <p>
        by  on <i itemprop="datePublished">2020-11-15</i></p>
        <p><span itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Every function should do exactly one thing. This is a software engineering maxim
that was transmitted to me during my education in Software Engineering and
repeated in numerous books on programming. My belief in it continues to be
strengthened through experience.</p>

<p>Of course even simple functions are composed of many machine instructions, and
would be of very little use if they weren't. However, functions exist to create
a level of abstraction, an informal set of conceptual building blocks. In most
programs you will write, these levels are not clear cut and defined by algebra,
geometry or physics, but loose and malleable, driven by your domain model and
the needs underlying your business logic.</p>

<p>Therefore, you should expect the definition of "One Thing" to admit <em>some</em>
wiggle room. Nevertheless, it is a very effective heuristic to apply to your
code. It's a fairly easy test to apply, and functions that clearly fail it are
very strong candidates for refactoring. Try not to worry about the edge cases.</p>

<p>An even stronger version of this test is that functions should never have a
conjunction in their name. A name should clearly express what the function does
at its level of abstraction; if that name has a <code>_and_</code> in it, that means that
that function is failing to do one thing by its own admission.</p>

<p>I've worked on code-bases with chronic problems that were caused largely by
functions with names like:</p>

<pre><code>create_or_update_xxx()
login_or_signup_user()
find_and_transform()
maybe_cache()
</code></pre>

<p>These problems went away once we were able to refactor these functions to only
do one thing, which was easy, and then change their call sites to use these new
functions, which was not. This, like many warnings against vice, is a much better
preventative than a cure.</p>

<p>Given that, I was called to reflection by a co-worker's code review, where he
pointed out that I'd written a group of functions with the word "maybe" in their
names. It was in a piece of code that handled integration with a legacy system
that was loose with types, and so these function existed to perform type
conversion--if needed.</p>

<p>A typical candidate looked like <code>maybe_convert_to_int(var: Any)</code>, and its body
would check whether the incoming variable had the right type, or if needed,
would apply the necessary conversion.</p>

<p>At first, I was puzzled and dismayed. To me, it was obvious that these functions
were necessary because they are dealing with unreliable data. However, the way
that I had named them, and therefore justified them to their calling clients,
expressed an uncertainty as to what they actually did. <em>Maybe</em> convert to int?
And despite what I'd said earlier, about not sweating the edge cases, I was
beginning to doubt my own advice.</p>

<p>Then it dawned at me that I was committing the error of analysing these
functions at the wrong level of abstraction. By focusing on how they operated, I
was obscuring what exactly they did.</p>

<p>In this case, I was able to fix the problem by considering the reason you'd call
this function--to ensure that a certain variable always has a given type. Viewed
from that lens, the function only does one thing. So I renamed my functions,
resubmitted my review and renewed my committment to the framework above.</p>

<p>The next time I run into a dilemma like this, it might require more than a
simple rename. If my initial rough-cut of the function mixes two
responsibilities from the consumer's level of abstraction, this simple lexical
rule might trigger their disentangling. That would be well worth it.</p>

<p>Maybe your functions are doing one and only one thing. Ensure that, when viewed
from the persective of your consumer, they are.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1931, a 25-year-old Kurt Gödel wrote a proof that turned mathematics upside down. The implication was so astounding, and his proof so elegant that it was...kind of funny. I wanted to share his discovery with you. Fair warning though, I’m not a mathematician; I’m a programmer. This means my understanding is intuitive and not exact. Hopefully, that will come to our advantage since I have no choice but to avoid formality 🙂. Let’s get to it.</p><p>For the last 300 years, mathematicians and scientists alike made startling discoveries, which led to one great pattern. The pattern was unification: ideas that were previously thought to be disparate and different consistently turned out to be one and the same!</p><p>Newton kicked this off for physicists when he discovered that what kept us rooted on the Earth was also what kept the Earth dancing around the sun. People thought that heat was a special type of energy, but it turned out that it could be explained with mechanics. People thought that electricity, magnetism, and light were different, but Maxwell discovered they could be explained by an electromagnetic field.</p><p>Darwin did the same for biologists. It turned out that our chins, the beautiful feathers of birds, deer antlers, different flowers, male and female sexes, the reason you like sugar so much, the reason whales swim differently...could all be explained by natural selection.</p><p>Mathematicians waged a similar battle for unification. They wanted to find the “core” principles of mathematics, from which they could derive all true theories. This would unite logic, arithmetic, and so on, all under one simple umbrella. To get a sense of what this is about, consider this question: How do we <em>know</em> that 3 is smaller than 5? Or that 1 comes before 2? Is this a “core” principle that we take on faith (the formal name for this is called an “axiom”) or can this be derived from some even more core principle? Are numbers fundamental concepts, or can they be derived from something even more fundamental?</p><p>Mathematicians made great progress in this battle for core principles. For example, a gentleman called Frege discovered that he could craft a theory of sets, which could represent just about everything. For numbers, for example, he could do something like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkyOTc0LWZhMTE3MjgwLTI4MGYtMTFlYi05MTM1LTVkYjRkZWFlZjgzYy5wbmc" alt="A demonstration of how to represent numbers with sets"></span></p><p>Here, he represents 0 the empty set. 1 as the set which contains the set for 0. 2 as the set that contains the set for 1 and 0. From this he could set a principle to get the “next” number: just wrap all previous numbers in a set. Pretty cool! Frege was able to take that and prove arithmetic rules like “1 + 1”, “numbers are infinite”, etc.</p><p>This looked formidable and cool, but Bertrand Russell came along and broke the theory in one fell swoop. </p><p>He used the rules that Frege laid out to make a valid but <em>nonsensical</em> statement. He proved something analogous to 1 + 1 = 3 <sup>1</sup>. This sounds innocuous; it was after-all just <em>one</em> statement. But nevertheless it was disastrous for a foundational theory of mathematics. If you could prove that 1 + 1 = 3, then you can’t really trust any true statement that results from this foundation. </p><p>This put mathematicians on a tail-spin. They even dubbed this period the “Foundational Crisis of Mathematics” </p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, a mathematician called Hilbert laid down some requirements for what a fundamental theory of mathematics had to look like <sup>2</sup>. He said that this theory must be a new language, with a set of rules that satisfied two primary constraints:</p><p>The theory would need to be able to prove <em>any</em> true mathematical statement. For example, imagine the statement 1 + 1 = 2. If this language can’t prove that statement, then it certainly can’t prove all of mathematics. Hilbert called this quality <strong>completeness.</strong> The language would need to be complete. </p><p>The second hard requirement, as we discussed earlier, was that it <em>could not</em> prove a false mathematical statement. If we could prove 1 + 1 = 3, then all was for naught. Hilbert called this <strong>consistency.</strong> The language would need to be consistent.</p><p>Bertrand Russell, the gentleman who broke Frege’s theory, worked together with Alfred North Whitehead to develop a theory of their own. They labored for years to craft an immense volume of work, called Principia Mathematica <sup>3</sup>.</p><p>They started by writing a new language (let’s call it PM) with a few simple rules. They took those rules,  and proceeded to prove a bunch of things. Russell and Whitehead took almost nothing on faith. For example, let’s look at this almost-impossible-to-read proof over here (don’t worry, you don’t need to understand the syntax for this essay):</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk5MjkzMDA0LTA0Y2MwNzgwLTI4MTAtMTFlYi05ZGJkLTRkMTlmYmQxMDM2My5wbmc" alt="An example, very hard-to-read proof from Principia Mathematica"></span></p><p>This proof showed that “1 + 1”, does indeed equal “2”. It took 2 volumes to get here.</p><p>Their language was dense and the work laborious, but they kept on proving a whole bunch of different truths in mathematics, and so far as anyone could tell at the time, there were no contradictions. It was imagined that at least in theory you could take this foundation and eventually expand it past mathematics: could you encode in pure logic how a dog behaves, or how humans think?</p><p>It certainly looked like Principia Mathematica could serve as the foundational theory for Mathematics. Until Gödel came along. </p><p>He proved that Principia Mathematica <em>did indeed have</em> true mathematical statements which <em>could not be proven</em> in the language. Principia Mathematica was incomplete.</p><p>This was startling, but his proof went even further. He showed that the entire enterprise behind Hilbert’s Program — to find a formal foundation for mathematics — could <em>never</em> work.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that a person could really prove that something can “never” happen — imagine if someone told you that we could never travel farther than our solar system — you’d look at them with suspicion.</p><p>Yet here Gödel was...a 25 year-old who proved beyond a doubt that this enterprise was impossible. He did this by showing that if a language could represent numbers, then unprovable statements would necessarily pop up.</p><p>Let’s think about that for a second: Numbers seem so quaint and easy to prove —  just “1”, “2”, “3”...so on. People thought we could eventually write down how humans think — imagine how shocked they must have been to see that we couldn’t prove all truths about...numbers.</p><p>Let’s see how Gödel did it.</p><p>Now Russel and Whitehead’s language was hard to read. There’s no harm done in changing some of their symbols around. Let’s map their language to something more amenable to programmers: Lisp! </p><p>You can imagine that Russell and Whitehead came up with a lisp-like language. Here’s how their syntax looked:</p><p>First, they had a few symbols for arithmetic.</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>zero</p></td><td><p><code>0</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>next</p></td><td><p>the next successor</p></td><td><p><code>(next 0)</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>+</p></td><td><p>plus</p></td><td><p><code>(+ 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>*</p></td><td><p>times</p></td><td><p><code>(* 0 (next 0))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>=</p></td><td><p>equals</p></td><td><p><code>(= 0 (* 0 (next 0)))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Just from these symbols, they could represent all natural numbers. If they proved that the symbol <code>0</code> worked like 0. and the symbol <code>next</code> worked like a successor function, then <code>(next 0)</code> could represent 1, <code>(next (next 0))</code> could represent 2, and so on. </p><p>Here’s how they could write <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>+</span><span> (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) (</span><span>next</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)) </span>

If you ever see me using a natural number inside PM-Lisp other than 0 (i.e “15”), you can imagine it’s shorthand to writing <code>(next (next (next ...))))</code> that many times. In this case, “15” means <code>next</code> applied to 0, 15 times</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>&lt;natural-number&gt;</code></p></td><td><p><code>(next (next ...))</code> applied to <code>0</code> <code>&lt;natual-number&gt;</code> times</p></td><td><div><p><code>3</code></p><p><em>means</em> <code>(next (next (next 0)))</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(Next (pun-intended)), they came up with some symbols to represent logic: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>not</p></td><td><p>not</p></td><td><p><code>(not (= 0 1))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>or</p></td><td><p>or</p></td><td><p><code>(or (= 0 1) (not (= 0 1)))</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>when</p></td><td><p>when ... then ..</p></td><td><div><p><code>(when 0 (or 0 1))</code></p><p><em>when 0, then there is either 0 or 1</em></p></div></td></tr><tr><td><p>there-is</p></td><td><p>there is ... such that ...</p></td><td><p><code>(there-is x (= 4 (* x 2))</code></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These symbols map closely to the logical statements we are used to in programming. The most unusual one is <code>there-is</code>. Let’s see one of those for an example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>there-is</span><span> x (</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> (</span><span>*</span><span> x </span><span>2</span><span>)))</span></code></pre><p>This is making a statement, that there is some number <code>x</code>, such that <code>(* x 2)</code> equals 4.  Well, that is indeed true: <code>x = 2</code>. That’s pretty cool — we’ve just made a general arithmetic statement. </p><p>Where did the <code>x</code> come from though? Oops, we need to account for that in our language:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>a...z, A...Z</p></td><td><p>variable</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In order to represent general truths, Russell and Whitehead introduced variables. Here’s how they could derive <code>and</code> for example: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>not</span><span> (</span><span>or</span><span> (</span><span>not</span><span> A) (</span><span>not</span><span> B)))</span></code></pre><p>When this statement is <code>true</code>, both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> must be true! </p><p>Very cool. One more trick for our essay. To make it a bit easier to read, sometimes I’ll introduce new symbols. They won’t actually be a part of the language, but it can make good shorthand for us in the essay</p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Form</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(def &lt;name&gt; &lt;formula&gt;)</code></p></td><td><p>define <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> to represent <code>&lt;formula&gt;</code></p></td><td><div><p><code>(def and (not (or (not A) (not B)))</code></p><p><em>same as</em> <code>(and &lt;var-a&gt; &lt;var-b&gt;...)</code></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now we can write <code>(and 1 2)</code> 🙂</p><p>All we saw above were <em>symbols.</em> They had no meaning yet. </p><p>Russell and Whitehead needed to prove that <code>0</code> works like zero, and that <code>=</code> works like equals. In order to breathe life into those symbols, they started off with some core principles — the axioms. </p><p>Here’s what they chose: </p><div><table><thead><tr><td><p><strong>Axiom</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p p) p)</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or apples, then apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when p (or p q))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples, then either apples or bananas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p q) (or q p))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples or bananas, then either bananas or apples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (or p (or q r)) (or q (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when either apples, bananas, or pears, then either bananas, apples, or pears</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>(when (when q r) (when (or p q) (or p r))</code></p></td><td><p>when apples are a fruit, then bananas or apples implies bananas or fruits</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That’s it. This is all we needed to take them on faith for. They took these rules and laboriously combined them in intricate ways to derive everything else. </p><p>For example, here’s how they derived <code>=</code>: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> = (</span><span>and</span><span> (</span><span>when</span><span> A B) (</span><span>when</span><span> B A)))</span></code></pre><p>If A implies B, and B implies A, they <em>must</em> be equal! Imagine this done for hundreds and hundreds of pages. </p><p>Note something essential here: their rules are so precise that there is no room for human judgement; a computer could run them.

I read through the filing this weekend and found it to be one of the most transparent, well argued prospectuses for a consumer business in recent memory. This week, I wanted to highlight a few elements of the S-1 that I found compelling and potentially useful for others constructing pitches.</p><h2>A case study in cohorts</h2><p>Doordash (soon-to-be DASH) reveals incredible detail in its cohort data. This contrasts sharply with Uber (NYSE:UBER), which revealed almost no cohort data in its IPO filing in 2019. Perhaps the most important chart in the entire S-1 is the cohorted contribution graph:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a07e78b-f54c-4c20-966b-360e708349b5_608x319.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:319,&quot;width&quot;:608,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>DASH defines contribution profit (CP) as gross profit less sales &amp; marketing costs, with a few non-cash items added back. CP is negative in Y1 due to spend on customer acquisition. In subsequent cohort years, DASH levels out its re-engagement marketing spend to ~2% of gross order value (GOV). That implies gross profit (GP) rises to 10% of GOV as cohorts age.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:353,&quot;width&quot;:637,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51661,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>DASH therefore invests around 7-10% of GOV to acquire a customer in Y1. That customer then generates 5-8% of GOV of CP in each year thereafter. This implies a 12-18 month payback on customer acquisition, and 3-4x LTV/CAC over the first 3 years.</p><p>In addition, DASH gives us some insight into the compounding GOV growth of its cohorts with the following table:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee190b56-a69b-4cd8-ac8a-a63a7cfa6921_605x208.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:208,&quot;width&quot;:605,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>At this rate, the cohorts compound at least 160% annually. A 3-year compounding period would put the cohort at 4x cumulative GMV, which roughly corresponds to the aforementioned unit economic ratios.</p><p>The consequence of these stable cohorts and attractive marketing payback ratios is that DASH will be able to compound its growth for years to come, with older cohorts  baking in a “same store sales” baseline of organic growth. Over time, this dynamic can result in significant operating leverage, as I tweeted about earlier this week:</p><h2>A granular view of unit economics</h2><p>DASH puts together an intuitive breakdown of the economics of a single order. Because it serves 3 parties (consumers, merchants, dashers), the flow of cash between them is more complex than it is for most marketplaces:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fbadde1-af51-451a-a9fb-a6bcb88072de_593x429.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:429,&quot;width&quot;:593,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>The filing also breaks down the granular components of contribution profit and tracks changes from 2018 to 2019:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1cc06874-c9ba-4fdb-9fa5-af6ecee443b8_630x789.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:630,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127728,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Here you can see the increase in take rate from 10% to 11% from 2018 to 2019. You can also see that DASH traded off improvements in COGS (-8% to -6%) for additional investments in sales &amp; marketing (-5% to -7%), maintaining a constant CP of -2%. Watching these tradeoffs gives one a sense for how management runs the business. In this case, management is investing additional cash flows from operational  improvements in growing the business faster. You’ll see why in the next section.</p><h2>Crystal clear strategy</h2><p>DASH boils down its business to 3 interlocking, virtuous flywheels:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e1ddbed4-f52d-407f-8354-eb99c0a4ea2a_594x349.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:349,&quot;width&quot;:594,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;LOGO&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="LOGO"></a></figure></div><p>The explanation touches upon the 3 key strategic elements of DASH’s business: </p><blockquote><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Local Network Effects:</strong>&nbsp;Our ability to attract more merchants, including local favorites and national brands, creates more selection in our Marketplace, driving more consumer engagement, and in turn, more sales for merchants on our platform. Our strong national merchant footprint enables us to launch new markets and quickly establish a critical mass of merchants and Dashers, driving strong consumer adoption.</em></p><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Economies of Scale:</strong>&nbsp;As more consumers join our local logistics platform and their engagement increases, our entire platform benefits from higher order volume, which means more revenue for local businesses and more opportunities for Dashers to work and increase their earnings. This, in turn, attracts Dashers to our local logistics platform, which allows for faster and more efficient fulfillment of orders for consumers.</em></p><p><em>•&nbsp;<strong>Increasing Brand Affinity:</strong>&nbsp;Both our local network effects and economies of scale lead to more merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our local logistics platform. As we scale, we continue to invest in improving our offerings for merchants, selection, experience, and value for consumers, and earnings opportunities for Dashers. By improving the benefits of our local logistics platform for each of our three constituencies, our network continues to grow and we benefit from increased brand awareness and positive brand affinity. With increased brand affinity, we expect that we will enjoy lower acquisition costs for all three constituencies in the long term.</em></p></blockquote><p>With this in mind, you can see why DASH would plough its margin gains into  increased spending on growth. More growth drives the flywheel faster, which brings more future margin improvements.</p><p>The chart also implies that <strong>brand is its own flywheel. “</strong>Brand” is one of those fuzzy concepts that Silicon Valley people tend to shy away from. It’s often viewed as subjective, or at best difficult to measure. After a decade of working with consumer-facing businesses, I can say that brand is very much a real thing and can build on its own success. However, <strong>brand is not an input to the flywheel; it’s an output.</strong> A great brand is what happens when you operate the business well. It’s a promise to the next cohort of customers that the service will be excellent. DASH gets this concept and features brand prominently in its strategy.</p><h2>Distinctive insights that drive performance</h2><p>The S-1 is littered with little insights that show the distinctive way in which DASH operates. Here’s an excerpt from the cultures/value section:</p><blockquote><p><em>Operate at the lowest level of detail: Averages in our industry are meaningless, it’s the distribution that matters. No consumer cares if our average delivery time is 35 minutes if they received their food in 53 minutes. At DoorDash, we go to the lowest level of detail to understand every part of our system, looking for “and” solutions that fight false “either/or” dichotomies. This is one reason why everyone at DoorDash, including me, tries to step out of our day-to-day roles once a month to do a delivery or engage in customer support, menu creation, or merchant support—staying very close to the needs of those who use our platform is key. We attribute our category-leading spend retention&nbsp;and capital efficiency, in part, to this obsession.</em></p></blockquote><p>Getting obsessed with the tails of the curve, not the average, is a great way to encapsulate what’s necessary to succeed in consumer-facing businesses. <strong>Fans are earned or lost at the margin. </strong>It’s not the average performance that counts.</p><p>DASH also revealed the core insight that differentiated it from its competitors in the early days:</p><blockquote><p><em>We believe that suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas have experienced significantly higher growth compared to larger metropolitan markets because these smaller markets have been historically underserved by merchants and platforms that enable&nbsp;on-demand&nbsp;delivery. Accordingly, residents in these markets are more acutely impacted by the lack of alternatives and the inconvenience posed by distance and the need to drive to merchants, and therefore consumers in these markets derive greater benefit from&nbsp;on-demand&nbsp;delivery. Additionally, suburban markets are attractive as consumers in these markets are more likely to be families who order more items per order. Lighter traffic and easier parking also mean that Dashers can serve these markets more efficiently. As a result of our early focus on and experience with suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas, we are particularly well positioned for continued growth in these markets.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to recall how unintuitive this insight was at the time Doordash started. Everyone assumed that the superior customer density of cities, selection of restaurants, and availability of couriers would lead to superior unit economics. In addition, Uber was relatively underpenetrated in the suburbs, so when it launched Uber Eats, it had fewer drivers to deliver and compete with DASH in those areas. When you start with mobility, you need to focus on cities. That requirement allowed DASH to win in the suburbs with superior margins.</p><p>In summary, I found the combination of quantitative and strategic insights in the S-1 to be illuminating. I hope that more companies in this IPO season reveal this level of transparency and insight into their respective businesses, and that some of this analysis inspires earlier stage companies to do the same.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.firehose.vc/p/firehose-181-dashing-to-ipo-?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.firehose.vc/p/firehose-181-dashing-to-ipo-?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h3>#commerce</h3><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a40ba83-d1d3-41bc-aae9-3b6ed4073511_729x530.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3a40ba83-d1d3-41bc-aae9-3b6ed4073511_729x530.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:530,&quot;width&quot;:729,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61985,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success&quot;}" alt=""></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/earning-the-premium-a-recipe-for-long-term-spac-success">Not all SPACs are created equal.</a>&nbsp;→</strong></h4><p>The rapid influx of capital into SPACs has resulted in dramatic changes to a once fringe component of the capital markets. Since 2015, SPACs have seen far fewer liquidations (10% vs. 20% previously), the average size has doubled from $200m to $400m, and mainstream investors from other asset classes have entered the fray.</p><p>Among these new SPAC investors, performance is not evenly distributed. A new study by McKinsey shows that SPACs with operators at the helm outperform those without operators by over 40% over the 12 month period following the merger. In fact, operator-led SPACs outperform the market index of the underlying company by 10%. For the first time, we have evidence that, with the right team and governance setup, the SPAC structure can produce superior results.</p><h4>#media</h4><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cc67790-ba02-46b1-9a47-db1b99020cd9_1245x701.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cc67790-ba02-46b1-9a47-db1b99020cd9_1245x701.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:701,&quot;width&quot;:1245,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Netflix is testing an audio-only mode to compete with podcasts and audiobooks&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode&quot;}" alt="Netflix is testing an audio-only mode to compete with podcasts and audiobooks"></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://www.protocol.com/netflix-testing-audio-only-mode">Podcast and chill.</a>&nbsp;→</strong></h4><p>I almost missed this short article a few weeks ago about Netflix* entering the audio-only space. Historically, Netflix has gone through two product phases. The first was the original DVD-by-mail business. The second is the current, streaming service. Philosophically, Reed Hastings has stated that he would rather expand into new types of content with a single platform to deliver it, rather than enter new content types (think gaming, music, VR, etc). </p><p>By testing audio-only stories on Android, he’s potentially showing a desire to start competing more directly with Spotify*, Apple*, and Amazon* in the podcast and audiobook category. If Netflix chose to do so, it could have a significant advantage given its content library and significant, global subscriber base.</p><h3>#tech</h3><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48a9540f-33aa-4e84-b87d-c85faf3a635d_1200x693.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48a9540f-33aa-4e84-b87d-c85faf3a635d_1200x693.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:693,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image for post&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c&quot;}" alt="Image for post"></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://jamesallworth.medium.com/intels-disruption-is-now-complete-d4fa771f0f2c">Intel out.</a>→</strong></h4><p>James Allworth, Head of Innovation at Clouflare and co-host of …</p></div></div>

You can use WPGraphQL in production with the confidence that it is secure, well documented, and supported full time and long term.</p><p>If you’re new to the WPGraphQL community, you may ask yourself, “But WordPress already has the REST API. What’s different about using WPGraphQL?” </p><p>Well, when you use WPGraphQL to turn your WordPress site into a GraphQL server, multiple resources can be fetched at the same time. And by design you get back the exact data you asked for, nothing more, nothing less. In addition to being easier to work with compared to the REST API, data loading with GraphQL is faster and more efficient. (Read more: “<a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/wpgraphql-vs-wp-rest-api/" data-type="docs" data-id="864">WPGraphQL vs. WP REST API</a>“)</p><p>If you are upgrading to 1.0 or another version, see <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases">the release notes</a> for information on breaking changes and preparing your site. If you are new, <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">start at the homepage</a> and follow our step-by-step docs. </p><p>In this post I want to talk about the journey to 1.0, why it took so long to get to 1.0, and a look at what’s next for WPGraphQL. But before diving into that, I want to also announce some other fun stuff that has also come to life along with this release.</p><ul><li>WPGraphQL is now available on the WordPress.org repository</li><li>New WPGraphQL.com website</li><li>WPGraphQL Swag available on the Gatsby Swag Store</li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg">WPGraphQL on WordPress.org</a><span id="wpgraphql-on-wordpressorg"></span></h2><p>The WordPress.org plugin repository has long been the default distribution mechanism for WordPress plugins. Prior to today, developers had to install WPGraphQL using Composer and installing from <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">packagist</a>, or by downloading from <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Github</a>. </p><p>Now, users can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql">install WPGraphQL directly from WordPress.org’s plugin directory</a>.</p><p>We believe that distributing WPGraphQL on the WordPress.org plugin repository should make it easier for users to find and install and keep updated.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#new-wpgraphqlcom-website">New WPGraphQL.com website</a><span id="new-wpgraphqlcom-website"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL.com has been re-built from the ground up. </p><p>Before today, WPGraphQL had 2 primary domains: </p><ul><li><code>WPGraphQL.com</code>, a “traditional” WordPress site using WordPress as the CMS <em>and </em>the theme layer</li><li><code>docs.wpgraphql.com</code>, a <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> site using Markdown files in a Github repository for the content. </li></ul><p>Now, instead of splitting some content in Markdown files on Github and some content in WordPress, WPGraphQL.com now uses WordPress as the CMS for all content, and and has a Gatsby front-end powered by the new <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/">Gatsby Source WordPress</a> plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGatsby</a> and of course <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/">WPGraphQL</a>. </p><p>We’ll be releasing tutorials and videos in the coming weeks and months walking through how various parts of the site were created to provide inspiration for you to build great things with this stack as well, but for now you can draw inspiration from the repository this site is built from: <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com">https://github.com/wp-graphql/wpgraphql.com</a></p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#wpgraphql-swag">WPGraphQL Swag</a><span id="wpgraphql-swag"></span></h2><p>Now, possibly the most exciting thing about this whole announcement, is the fact that you can now <a href="https://store.gatsbyjs.org/">get WPGraphQL Swag from the Gatsby swag store</a>.</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#the-journey-to-10">The Journey to 1.0</a><span id="the-journey-to-10"></span></h2><p>WPGraphQL was started in November 2016 (with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/commit/6723f8cdf16b85cc827fe7ec1cbcb10aa02fa616">no commit message</a>&nbsp;🤣&nbsp;) and has come a long way in that time.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.wpgraphql.com/static/770921a32b9578c1779a53ddb653c9f4/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-10.47.30-AM.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px"><figcaption>Screenshot of the “Initial Commit” in Github</figcaption></figure></div><p>By the end of 2017 the codebase was pretty robust and provided a Schema to interact with many parts of WordPress. Posts, Pages, Custom Post Types, Tags, Categories, Custom Taxonomies, Comments and Nav Menus.</p><p><a href="https://qz.com/">Qz.com</a>&nbsp;was the first site to go to production with WPGraphQL, even before&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;was using it in production! A few years later and they are still running on WPGraphQL! You can learn more about the early days of their stack from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvkDdYAA64A">this presentation</a>&nbsp;from December 2017.</p><p>In early 2018, my team took WPGraphQL into production on a network of 54 large WordPress sites. WPGraphQL was used as a syndication engine for our network of newspapers. Unlike most GraphQL users, we didn’t initially have a JavaScript or native mobile UI that was using GraphQL, we had PHP WordPress servers syndicating content and GraphQL solved a lot of pain points we had been facing when using REST.</p><p>By the end of 2018, more than 100 sites were using WPGraphQL in some way.</p><p>Now, WPGraphQL seems to be running all over the place!</p><p>This is a non-comprehensive list of sites using WPGraphQL in production in some way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://denverpost.com/">DenverPost.com</a></li><li><a href="https://twincities.com/">TwinCities.com</a></li><li><a href="https://mercurynews.com/">MercuryNews.com</a></li><li><a href="https://siliconvalley.com/">SiliconValley.com</a></li><li><a href="https://qz.com/">QZ.com</a></li><li><a href="https://meowwolf.com/">MeowWolf.com</a></li><li><a href="https://theplayerstribune.com/">ThePlayersTribune.com</a></li><li><a href="https://apollographql.com/blog">ApolloGraphQL.com</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.creditkarma.com/">blog.creditkarma.com</a></li></ul><p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/wp-graphql/wp-graphql">Packagist.org</a>&nbsp;as of June 30, 2020 there were nearly 50,000 installs of WPGraphQL in the wild, and as of November 2020 Packagist reports 71,573 installs.</p><p>In 2019 Credit Karma paid for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/pwning-wordpress-graphql/">security audit</a>&nbsp;on the plugin and all reported issues were resolved.</p><p>It’s safe to say, WPGraphQL is production ready!</p><h2><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#so-why-the-wait-for-10">So, why the wait for 1.0?</a><span id="so-why-the-wait-for-10"></span></h2><p>So, if WPGraphQL has been production ready for such a long time, why is is still not 1.0?</p><h3><a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/2020/11/16/announcing-wpgraphql-v1/#breaking-changes-wordpress">Breaking Changes &amp; WordPress</a><span id="breaking-changes-wordpress"></span></h3><p>The WordPress ecosystem has a strong commitment to backward compatibility. This means that once functionality is introduced to a WordPress plugin, it often sticks around&nbsp;<em>forever</em>.</p><p>With that in mind, before tagging WPGraphQL 1.0, I wanted so badly to be at a place with the codebase &amp; Schema that I could no longer predict anymore breaking changes. </p><p>I wanted the GraphQL Schema to be “perfect” before tagging it 1.0, because I knew that whatever would be in the WPGraphQL Schema at 1.0 would need to remain in the Schema&nbsp;<em>forever</em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-30-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

All three languages support both allocation models, but how the language itself centers and defaults certain models is important to downstream development and interoperation between codebases. C and Rust have one allocation model, and it can be embodied by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html">the Rust documentation here for its <code>GlobalAlloc</code> trait</a>, with my own emphasis added:</p><blockquote><p><code>unsafe fn alloc(&amp;self, layout: Layout) -&gt; *mut u8</code></p><p>Allocate memory as described by the given <code>layout</code>.</p><p>Returns a pointer to newly-allocated memory, or <strong>null to indicate allocation failure</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>This embodies the important trait of the first and most fundamental allocation model…</p><h2 id="model-0-fallible-allocation">Model 0: Fallible Allocation</h2><p><em>Fallible Allocation</em> means that failure is built into how the desired allocator behaves. It is the <code>if result != null</code> style of handling. That is, the error is returned as part of <strong>normal control flow</strong>, and is central to the code itself. The Fallible model is how both low-level Rust (<code>GlobalAlloc</code> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.AllocRef.html">its unstable/nightly friend, <code>AllocRef</code></a>) and C code (with <code>malloc</code> or its many, many replacements and variants) behave. C has no standard way to handle errors, so it is on the end-user to detect that allocation has failed and do something. Rust provides a bit more infrastructure for its Fallible model, thankfully. Folks working with unsafe code are encouraged to attempt allocation, and call the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/fn.handle_alloc_error.html">default bad allocation handler</a> built into the standard for failure. Rust’s also comes with the ability to set a hook for allocation failure to further customize the behavior.</p><p>In both C and Rust, handling these errors is a part of using the allocator, and in both cases it is caught by checking for <code>null</code>/<code>NULL</code>. The null pointer value then becomes the sentinel and anchor that downstream users of C and Rust Allocators can switch on. Or, at least, this was the case with the global allocator: Rust’s <code>AllocRef</code> returns a more robust <code>Result&lt;NonNull&lt;[u8]&gt;, AllocErr&gt;</code>. A more informative <code>AllocErr</code> is returned for Rust’s enhanced interface, and old code using Rust’s the global allocator wrapped around this simply transmutes a <code>null</code> value to a basic allocator error. For C++ folk, <code>AllocRef</code>’s return type is the equivalent of <code>std::expected&lt;std::span&lt;unsigned char&gt;, bad_alloc&gt;</code>. (<a href="https://wg21.link/p0323">Not that <code>std::expected</code> is real yet</a>; it’s in a holding pattern as we spin around other topics instead.) Strangely enough, however, C++ chose a different model than Rust settled on or its predecessor, C, did. C++’s <code>std::allocator</code> and all conforming allocator objects, as well as the default <code>new</code> expressions, went for the second model…</p><h2 id="model-1-infallible-allocation">Model 1: Infallible Allocation</h2><p>In C++, every allocation in normal control flow is a perfect one. The reason for this perfection is because C++ developers, all coming from C, were frustrated by literal decades of writing this out in all sorts of ways:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>int</span><span>*</span> data_elements;
<span id="1">1</span><span>/* ...*/</span>
<span id="2">2</span>data_elements <span>=</span> malloc(<span>sizeof</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>*</span> data_elements_count);
<span id="3">3</span><span>if</span> (data_elements <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span>) {
<span id="4">4</span>	fprintf(stderr, <span>"well this is a big shame?"</span>);
<span id="5">5</span>	exit(<span>1</span>);
<span id="6">6</span>}
<span id="7">7</span><span>// actual real stuff to do
</span></code></pre></div><p>C++ decided that it wasn’t going to deal with this “error prone” code anymore, or let people just get away with calling <code>malloc</code> and not checking the return value properly at all (which, unfortunately, is done more often than I’d like to properly acknowledge in even the most robust software and firmware). So, when C++ created their <code>new</code>, they made it quite a bit more aggressive:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>int</span><span>*</span> data_elements;
<span id="1">1</span>data_elements <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[data_elements_count]();
<span id="2">2</span><span>// actual real stuff to do
</span></code></pre></div><p>This code is shorter, more type-safe (the size is packed in the <code>new</code> expression and the multiplication is done implicitly for you in a lower-level language function), and no longer needs to check for the error. But that’s not because it can’t fail: it’s because the language has externalized the cost. It throws a <code>bad_alloc</code> exception now, rather than let the user handle it. This makes the call site clean and even provides a performance benefit to “happy path” code. So useful was this practice of turning errors (precondition violations, allocation failures, and more) into exceptions that when we created the <code>std::allocator</code> type to be paired with <code>std::vector</code> and everything it went into thereafter, we <a href="https://soasis.org/posts/fallible-allocators/eel.is/c++draft/allocator.requirements#general-10">baked this into the Cpp17Allocator named requirements</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Memory is allocated for an array of <code>n</code> <code>T</code> and such an object is created but array elements are not constructed.<br>…<br>[<em>Note 3: Additionally, the member function allocate for that type can fail by throwing an object of type <code>bad_­alloc</code>. — end note</em>]</p></blockquote><p><a id="fnref-allocator-pedanticism"></a>Nowhere are you allowed to return <code>NULL</code> or <code>nullptr</code> in C++ for its typical <code>Cpp17Allocator</code>. Once the <code>.allocate(n, ...)</code> function returns, <a href="#fn-allocator-pedanticism">it needs to be a valid pointer <sup>0</sup></a> to the first object for an array of at least <code>n</code> said objects. This makes the allocator Infallible and removes the need to check, which is definitely an improvement over its C predecessor. Ignoring the cost of polymorphic, inheritance-based exception throwing and catching, this seems like strictly a win. But even in a purely theoretical world with perfect, zero-cost exception handling, there is a design issue with <code>Cpp17Allocator</code>. There is no way to signal failure in the normal control flow of code. This creates an interesting problem, where you run into an interesting use case…</p><p>Or, AFINAE.</p><p>Allocation failure is not always an error in many cases. I do not mean this in the “well, we can free more memory and return a better pointer later” sense, I mean that literally the work can continue without using the allocated space asked for. This is most on display when it comes to certain algorithms: you can often trade increased space for better speed. The C++ standard recognizes this, too, and has wording built in to 3 algorithms for this. <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/alg.merge#11">One such algorithm is <code>std::inplace_merge</code></a> (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>Complexity: Let <em>N</em> = <code>last - first</code>:<br>— For the overloads with no <code>ExecutionPolicy</code>, and <strong>if enough additional memory is available</strong>, exactly <em>N</em> −1 comparisons.<br>— Otherwise, Θ(<em>N</em> log <em>N</em>) comparisons.</p></blockquote><p>But, if you look at the signature for <code>std::inplace_merge</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0">0</span><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>BidirectionalIterator</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span id="1">1</span><span>void</span> inplace_merge(BidirectionalIterator first,
<span id="2">2</span>                   BidirectionalIterator middle,
<span id="3">3</span>                   BidirectionalIterator last);
</code></pre></div><p>There’s no memory source.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Well, it turns out that these algorithms just… take some memory. Usually, its taken from some unspecified global pool. Algorithms like this in the Standard Library are <code>std::inplace_merge</code>, <code>std::stable_sort</code>, and <code>std::stable_partition</code>. For example, in the Microsoft C++ Standard Library, they just <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/master/stl/inc/algorithm#L7929">call their own internal version of <code>std::get_temporary_buffer()</code> (now deprecated)</a>. <code>get_temporary_buffer</code> was implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/barrelshifter/status/659080214891204608">poorly in all STL implementations</a>, but the API’s design was exactly what was needed. It gave a chunk of memory suitable for an array of that object type, or signaled failure in normal control flow without throwing an exception. This is essential to fulfilling the promise of these algorithms, because they can work both with and without memory. From this design need, it can be immediately observed:</p><p><em><code>Allocators</code> in C++ are fundamentally incapable of solving this problem in the Standard Library!</em></p><p>There is no extra parameter to give a memory source to <code>inplace_merge</code> or <code>stable_sort</code> because in C++ there is no type that satisfies these requirements. Passing a <code>std::allocator</code> here will simply crash and burn, and it’s not like <code>std::memory_resource</code> is any better since it maintains the <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/mem.res.private#2">same “returns a valid pointer, tosses an exception, or dies”</a> mentality. By centering an Infallible Allocator model in C++, we traded simplicity for the lack of ability to handle complex cases. This also doesn’t stop here, either: Parallel Algorithm and, soon, Executor-based implementations of asynchronous/parallel algorithms are going to need memory sources they can strongly control as well.</p><p>Not having any kind of Fallible Allocator in the Standard thus becomes a damaging problem that hampers our ability to control allocations. It means forcing developers to outlaw the use of those functions in shared code if they are targeting specific environments. It means not being able to just opt-in to always using the fall back option directly. And, ultimately, it means a standard library that is less useful and less inclusive of diverse, important use cases in the wild. Parallel algorithms are not going anywhere, and the need for them is only going to increase as heterogenous computing continues to thrive.</p><p>So, we are going to need to have a Fallible Allocator, at some point.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems like the best way to solve this problem is by creating a new <code>FallibleAllocator</code> named requirement that has the requisite API changes. Particularly, rather than <code>my_alloc.allocate(...)</code> returning a pointer, it will return a <code>std::optional&lt;non_null&lt;T*&gt;&gt;</code>. The reason I say this over something like <code>std::expected&lt;non_null&lt;T*&gt;, bad_alloc&gt;</code> like Rust is because <code>bad_alloc</code> is a lot more heavyweight than I would ever want it, and no user-facing constructor allows anyone to override what information is kept in the string. Thusly <code>optional</code> is strictly better here. A minimal class would likely take this form:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span id="0"> 0</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;optional&gt;</span><span>

<p>Building software products means coping with complexity. Our products are highly interconnected systems of systems. Dynamics are difficult to model; outcomes can be difficult to predict. </p>



<p>Ivory towers crumble on this unstable ground. It is not sufficient to have one person deciding for the whole group – everyone following the direction of a “grand strategist”. Decision-making in complex environments needs to be decentralized.</p>



<p>If we are all to take part in decision-making, then we all need to constantly improve our knowledge of the problems we face – we need to be active participants in a learning organization.</p>



<p>Learning is both an individual and a group experience. Organizations that excel tap the commitment to learn from people at all levels. And learning is something deeper than just taking in information. It is about changing ourselves – growing in meaningful ways that contribute to the collective whole. So we want to build an organizational culture that promotes that deep connection to growth. </p>



<p>I have found the five disciplines of learning&nbsp;from the book The Fifth Discipline helps to inspire ideas about how to develop this culture. A quick summary: </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RhAPMibaL.jpg" alt="The Fifth Discipline: The art and practice of the learning organization:  Senge, Peter M.: 8601420120846: Books - Amazon.ca" width="118" height="178"></figure></div>



<ol><li>Systems thinking – seeing how all of our work connects, sharing the big picture. Proactively developing a collective understanding that we can use at all levels to spot patterns such as how certain problems persist, or the way systems develop built-in limitations to growth. (Systems can be technical, organizational, managerial, etc.)</li><li>Personal Mastery – continually developing our ability to see our current reality more clearly; this flows from the idea that what we do is creative work, and creativity results from the movement of ideas. “Still water becomes stagnant.”</li><li>Mental Models – models guide our ability to make decisions and are rooted in an organization’s fundamental values and principles. How are we building them? Sharing them? Reinforcing them? They have a natural entropy and tendency to diverge – they must be actively maintained, especially the core values at their foundation.</li><li>Shared Vision – having a shared vision enables co-creation. When we have that vision present in our day to day work, we are building things together for a common goal. This helps frame the context of the learning we engage in. </li><li>Team Learning – this involves two practices: discourse and discussion. Discourse is the practice of presenting knowledge to others. Discussion is the practice of inquiry and exploration into the discourse. Both are crucial.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>To build a learning org, we can start by asking the questions in these disciplines to enrich our learning experience. Questions like: How can I help other teams expand their understanding of how our work connects? How can I share my mental model with others? What activities can I do to reinforce our shared values? What kinds of “discourse” activities can I be doing to promote discussions? </p>



<p>We can start doing that today by creating the Tiny Habits needed to ask these questions at the right times. And we should not expect anyone to build out learning organization for us – we all need to take ownership and do our part. What are you doing to help?</p>

                    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> is probably the most unintuitive scientific theory in the history of humankind—nothing behaves like we are used to. In this essay, we will try to get back some intuition of how to think about quantum mechanics, more specifically the quantum random walk. No worries, there are going to be <em>no equations</em>—this is not a scientific paper. The main purpose of this essay is to make the reader curious by showing how weird our reality is and how this knowledge might help us in the future.</p><p>Most people are familiar with the classical random walk which is a mathematical framework used to describe a lot of phenomena—e.g. Stock-prices and Brownian motion. The quantum random walk is less known and not as useful for explanations, but there are some interesting fields it might get more important in. The most notable cases are quantum computing—specifically Grover’s Algorithm—and quantum biology. The later field is the study of how and why quantum mechanics is important for explaining biology and it is still a pretty new and often controversial field.</p><h2 id="classical">Classical</h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">classical random walk</a> in one dimension can be thought of as flipping a coin and going one step forward (+1) if it shows heads and one step backward (-1) if it shows tails. This is the simplest version of the random walk but it is sufficient to illustrate some important concepts.</p><p>The first thing to note is that probabilities approach a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> (Gaussian). After one coin flip—T=1 steps—we find ourselves with the probability of 1/2 at 1 and with the probability of 1/2 at -1. After T=2 steps we find ourselves with a probability of 1/4 at 2, with the probability of 1/4 at -2, and with the probability of 1/2 at 0 (Figure 3). By continuing this sequence, we can see the normal distribution emerging.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586508603527-Q4JJL2080G6VZWKF1M1Q/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIjS6q4cv5cYFkTz_escvjFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVHk1kd5ZhDKaoPBq5dMMgNiLIFqjsmkQkqMmAV2uYMQkty480UlKOY0DP3Mqxn-Omk/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w" alt="The random walk can be visualized with Galton’s Board."></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509218902-IQ5G4Z3K1RGD1VFKIV0J/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kC4WqmtwEkHAKs-GAMAt7IJZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIMY-uRSxFfrlmpPcZO_V5RxeWyHosL0CxVv30qiNAUhM/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.00.08.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a classical random walk"></figure><p>One important but counter-intuitive fact is that after T steps the average distance from our starting point (0) is not 0. You might expect that if we always move +1 or -1, we would on average not move way from the start (0), but that is not the case. The average distance from our start after T steps is roughly √(T). We will not prove this fact since I promised not to use equations but we will at least see why 0 is the wrong answer.</p><p>The distance from our starting point can never be negative—a distance is only ever be positive. Even if we find ourselves after T=2 at the point -2, the distance to our starting point (0) is not -2 but 2. Put differently, it does not matter in which direction you go, you cannot be -5 meters away from your home (try it at home). Starting from this point, the interested reader can figure out (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk#One-dimensional_random_walk">or lookup</a>) why the average distance is of the order of √(T).</p><h2 id="quantum">Quantum</h2><p>For a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">quantum random walk</a>, we need what I will call a “quantum coin”; it is a fair coin that just like the classical one has the probability of 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. Note that this quantum coin does not exist and in reality and the “coin flip” is a mathematically defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation_(quantum_mechanics)">unitary operation</a> manipulating the state of a system—spin—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>. We will use the balanced—fair—quantum coin named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk#Discrete_time">Hadamard coin</a> for our example. The most important thing to understand here is that we have defined this coin to be fair. When we flip it, we get heads half of the time and tails the other half of the time. As with our classical coin, we will move one step forward (+1) if it lands on heads and one step backward (-1) if it lands on tails. After T=1 flips (or steps) we will be at 1 with the probability of 1/2 and at -1 with the probability of 1/2. So far, so good—everything is behaving “classically.”</p><p>Now comes the weird part, instead of measuring after each step, we will measure only at the end—let us say, after T=5 flips. This represents, in a way, the quantum version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine">Galton’s Board</a>. If everything behaved classically, it would not make a difference if we looked—i.e. measured—after every step or just at the end, but since we are dealing with weird quantum mechanics it makes a huge difference. The probability distribution looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586509307347-UCS5QF91ZOP00Q86H56T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kJOa5YPqCmGvzx7mCN2r0EdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIsiIvZpik36d-7psP9EKVUlUUi2YiCCZOvvpVrdTT-CE/Screen+Shot+2020-04-10+at+11.01.06.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a quantum walk"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586526747838-SHOBBHF1UHDH1H2UI1LD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kOLb81ARpkFxFMv5Mbr56oVZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEEkvzdRL4CfH2OmtAD12M-DuTV5gn_3pnKAHtbVSWOI91lH3P2bFZvTItROhWrBJ0/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution visualized"></figure><p>Keep in mind that to measure the probabilities for T=5, we are only allowed to measure after those 5 flips—never in-between. To get the probabilities for the other steps we need to measure only after e.g. T=3 but we cannot continue the experiment afterward and measure T=5.</p><p>Looking at the table (Figure 4), we can see a couple of interesting things. First, the distribution starts to differ from the classical one after T=3. Second, the distribution is not symmetric; in this case, it is skewed to the left (negative) side. This is the case because we started with the initial state “spin down”. In our coin analogy, this corresponds to which side is facing upwards <em>before</em> you flip the coin. Take a moment to appreciate how unbelievable this is.</p><p>We defined the coin so it has exactly 1/2 chance of landing on heads and 1/2 of landing on tails; and if we look after one flip, it works perfectly and it does not matter in which initial condition the coin was—i.e. which side was facing upward before the flip. But if we only look after T=5 flips, it matters a lot in which initial condition the coin was; it is suddenly important which side of the coin was facing upwards before we flipped it. This is because of a phenomenon at the heart of Quantum Mechanics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference">interference</a>.</p><p>If we do the experiment with our system having “spin up” we will get the same distribution skewed to the right. To get a symmetrical distribution, we have to put the system into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a> of the two states “spin up” and “spin down.” Superposition means that the system is in both states at the same time and only when we “measure” it, the system decides the state. In our analogy, we have to prepare the coin so that it lies with heads up and tails up at the same time. This is, obviously, not possible with a real coin but doable with a quantum system.</p><figure><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5dd3db4b74619b13c315e268/1586529134138-8UG2L02UHXH0YUZI861S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGsLnSpN9SmgRY0kKOgjdudZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVFCeGs_oZuelCVw0HtcXhz3OCHUHA_lcJEJorkwU3xVcmbSd6kfRtgWHgNMDgGnmDY/image-asset.png?format=500w" alt="Probability distribution of a Hamard walk with a superposition of initial conditions"></figure><p>The most interesting and useful feature of the quantum walk is that in contrast to the classical walk, the expected distance from the origin is not √(T) but T. This means that a quantum walk is quadratically faster than a classical random walk. In T flips—steps—we expect to find ourselves at the distance T from the start. This is incredible. One cannot understand this feature by thinking “classically.” We can only imagine that the quantum random walk is not going +1 <em>or</em> -1 at each step but rather <em>both</em> at the same time and the system only decides on one alternative when being measured (this mixture of superposition and interference makes everything extremely counter intuitive). Now, let us see why is it useful to know about this weird quantum random walk.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: another big difference to the classical random walk can be seen by adding an absorption barrier. While the classical walk has the probability of p=1 to be eventually absorbed, the quantum walk has, as described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">this paper</a>, a chance of escaping to infinity.)</p><h2 id="grover-s-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h2><p>Searching through lists and sorting them is one of the most popular tasks computers nowadays perform. Finding fast search and sorting algorithms is getting increasingly important because the amount of available data is skyrocketing and unsearchable or unsorted databases are mostly useless. This is where—in theory—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s algorithm</a> comes in; it is a quantum algorithm for searching an item in an unsorted list. Only in theory because a good enough quantum computer has not been build yet and scaling up from the ones we have already build is not trivial.</p><p>If you want to find a particular item in a list with N items classically, you need to check all N items—N evaluations—because the item you are searching for could be the last in the list. (If you are sure that the item is in the list, the correct number of evaluations is N-1, but this does not matter much here.) This means searching through an unsorted database with N entries takes—classically—N steps. However, with Grover’s quantum algorithm—which can be viewed as a quantum random walk—it takes √(N) steps. It allows for the same quadric speedup as the quantum random walk. For large databases—lists with big N— this can mean a lot fewer evaluations.</p><p>(A note for the technical reader: it is sadly (or luckily?) not possible to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time with this algorithm.)</p><h2 id="photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</h2><p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge</a>, Johnjoe McFadden and Jim Al-Khalili argue that quantum physics is needed to explain biological phenomena. One of the most important processes in biology is photosynthesis which, according to the authors, probably relies on the quantum random walk since such efficient transportation seems difficult to explain otherwise. However, quantum biology is a new and often controversial field and I am sadly not in the position to judge the credibility of this claim because my knowledge of biology is rudimentary at best.</p><p>Some people believe that uncovering this mechanism of nature can help us build technologies that more efficiently convert the energy of sunlight into electric energy and I hope they are right. For those who are interested, I can highly recommend the already mentioned book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307986829/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307986829&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=e25ab2bb13badbe39bef972c3992240e&amp;tag=limitlesscuri-20">Life on the Edge.</a></p><h2 id="curious">Curious?</h2><p>I hope this essay has shown the reader how weird our world at the smallest scale behaves without asking for many technical prerequisites. I have done my best to keep the explanations as intuitive as possible which is why I had to omit many details. For the interested reader, I would suggest “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0303081.pdf">Quantum random walks: An introductory overview</a>” by J. Kempe as a further reading—it is also the source for most of the figures. Keep in mind that you will need a decent amount of mathematical and physical background knowledge to understand it though. Having said this, I hope that my essay made some people curious about our world and that is all I can ask for.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

		<p>From The Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/">The Next Decade Could Be Even Worse: A historian believes he has discovered iron laws that predict the rise and fall of societies. He has bad news.</a></p>
<p>Turchin’s core argument ,based on data mining and mathematical modeling, is that an overproduction of elites will lead to societal unrest and collapse in the US, that should unfold soon. This occurs in cycles of 50 or so years.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Certain aspects of this cyclical view require relearning portions of American history, with special attention paid to the numbers of elites. The industrialization of the North, starting in the mid-19th century, Turchin says, made huge numbers of people rich. The elite herd was culled during the Civil War, which killed off or impoverished the southern slaveholding class, and during Reconstruction, when America experienced a wave of assassinations of Republican politicians. (The most famous of these was the assassination of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, by a lawyer who had demanded but not received a political appointment.) It wasn’t until the Progressive reforms of the 1920s, and later the New Deal, that elite overproduction actually slowed, at least for a time.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
This oscillation between violence and peace, with elite over­production as the first horseman of the recurring American apocalypse, inspired Turchin’s 2020 prediction. In 2010, when Nature surveyed scientists about their predictions for the coming decade, most took the survey as an invitation to self-promote and rhapsodize, dreamily, about coming advances in their fields. Turchin retorted with his prophecy of doom and said that nothing short of fundamental change would stop another violent turn.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree with his forecasts at all, and I take the opposite position that  America is in a prolonged   period of  prosperity,  peace, and  dominance (esepcially relative to the rest of the world since 2008) that may last indefinitely. By investing in US stocks, you are making an indirect bet in this trend continuing, but if Turchin is right, the best investment would probably be treasury bonds, which are yielding very little now (so there is very little profit potential). But I can say with 100% certainty that my forecast is way more likely to be accurate than Turchin’s. Shorting the market is not an option , owing to path tendency and possible insolvency from being ‘too early’. </p>
<p>Turchin blames an ‘over-production of elites’ for impending unrest, yet it is not so much that all college grads aspire to elite positions but rather seek the higher wages and nicer lifestyle that a college degree bestows. And as long as the college wage premium keep widening, we should expect more college grads and higher tuition costs. If the premium was to suddenly contract, then college enrolment would fall and there would be fewer production of these elites. </p>
<p>Even if empires cyclically rise and fall within certain fixed or predictable intervals, there are many factors protecting the US from such collapse, and when such factors are combined make the possibly far more remote than quantitative historical analysis would suggest:</p>
<p>1. Considerable ethnic, cultural, religious, and economic diversity , which makes it harder to foment revolution and increases political and economic stability even if such diversity leads to local tensions, such as black-on-white crime. </p>
<p>Vox Day and others argue that increased diversity will lead to unrest and the break-up of America, but I have <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/does-diversity-proximity-lead-to-war-probably-not-as-far-as-the-us-is-concerned/">argued</a> it is a prophylactic against such unrest. Civil wars and revolution are typically engendered by homogenous groups against a second group cut from the same ethnic and racial cloth. The Revolutionary War pitted New England against Britain. The Civil War pitted Anglo Protestants up North against Anglo Protestants from the South. The Iranian revolution pitted anti-Western Iranian religious fundamentalists against pro-Western Iranian rulers.   </p>
<p>Also, if diversity is supposed to be destabilizing, why would elites push for it? Why would elites support policy that would lead to their undoing and loss of power and wealth as the US collapses due to war arising from such diversity? That makes no sense. This is an obvious logical contradiction that many dissidents such as Vox and others cannot account for. </p>
<p>Although small, homogenous countries can prosper for a long time (the Nordic countries for example), I believe that homogeneity makes such countries more vulnerable if the right conditions are met (economic downturns, war, indebtedness, inflation, etc.). This was the case during the French and Russian revolutions, in which debts due to war caused high unemployment and basic needs not being met for large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>2. Highly productive and large ‘smart fraction’ (discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/the-iq-debate/">earlier</a>) under optimal economic and social conditions, which is a major contributing factor for America’s economic dominance and strength, especially since 2008. </p>
<p>3. Large geographic size. Similar to #1, this makes it hard for aggrieved, disenfranchised groups to collectively rise up, as everyone is literally all spread out.</p>
<p>4. Unparalleled, unrivaled  military and economic dominance relative to the rest of the developed world, even China. The British Empire, during its height in the early 20th century, was in  relatively much weaker position than the US is in now, and faced major competitors such as France, Germany, The Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, etc. The only major possible competitor or comparable strength is China, which does not have imperial ambitions. </p>
<p>5. Foreign competitors have no imperial ambitions, unlike centuries ago when Spain, France, the Netherlands, England, Germany, Portugal, Ottoman Empire, etc. were all vying for control (especially of India, Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America):</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/debitage.net/humangeography/images/Colonialism_1914.png"></p>
<p>In spite of all the sabre rattling, China has no imperial ambitions.  So many people are predicting an imminent ‘clash of the civilizations’ between the US and China. I think nothing of that sort will happen and there will be continued peace, with the occasional tough talk and posturing and threats such as Trump’s tariffs and ‘trade war’ (which was more media hype than a war) that gets a lot of media coverage, but nothing substantive happens. In regard to purported expansionism, China has done very little actual expansion. The annexation of Tibet was 70 years ago. The last incident of expansion could technically be in in 1997 when Hong Kong was transferred to China from Britain.</p>
<p>6. America’s large bureaucracy and its constitutional republic composed to hundreds of Congressmen and Senators creates a lot of redundancy and limits the damage any one individual can do, unlike aristocracies and nobilities, which are more centralized and have point of failure. Yet at the same time, in spite of this large federal government and also numerous state governments, the private sector has a lot of autonomy, with the federal government only interceding during crisis but otherwise tending to keep an hands-off approach, although the Covid shutdowns are a possible exception to this.  </p>
<p>7. A large middle class and high standards of living, further making revolution and mass unrest unlikely even if there are occasional outbursts such as BLM protests. </p>
<p>I don’t think Turchin’s research is of any useful predictive value. I don’t know why his ideas have gotten so much attention when there are so many obvious methodological problems and dubious assumptions, such as that history must cycle or that empires must fall. The problem with making such inferences based on historical trends and patterns is that the circumstances for each country, throughout history, are unique and it is hard to generalize. You can say “going back 2000 years, empires and regimes on average last 200-400 years,” but there is no immutable law that says it must be less than 400 years. It can be 4,000 or 40,000 under the right circumstances, for all we know.  Because the conditions are so vague and the time frames are so long, it is hard to quantifiably and objectively test Turchin’s ideas. Mathematics typically tries to make things precise, yet history is imprecise in nature, so attempting to merge these things probably yields the worst of both. </p>

It’s a distribution channel. 🙂</p><p>With almost 250 subscribers in its first three weeks giving me feedback and encouragement, <strong>it’s made the pre-product process fun for me.</strong></p><h4>Reddit</h4><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/">r/ProductManagement</a> has ~40k readers. It’s an engaged community with lots of smart, motivated product people.</p><p>My early successes with posts for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jmofq3/every_product_needs_a_niche_heres_the_criteria_i/">Step Two</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/jqz961/how_i_validated_whether_people_will_use_and_pay/">Step Three</a> show that the community appreciates my content.</p><h4>Twitter</h4><p>Twitter is full of interesting and influential people sharing thoughts and having public conversations. And they’re all accessible - just 280 characters away.</p><h4>LinkedIn</h4><p>LinkedIn is a content-deficient platform - there’s more demand for quality content than supply.</p><p>And pretty much all product and engineering leaders spend time on the platform.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">Feel free to connect</a> and shoot me a message! 🙂</p><h4>SEO</h4><p>In the early days, I can hustle my way to 20-30% month-over-month growth.</p><p>But when 20% growth requires adding 20+ new companies, I need to be able to rely on more scalable channels.</p><p>I’m optimistic that SEO will be my best sustainable growth driver in the long-term.</p><h4>The product</h4><p>Eventbrite’s product was inherently viral. A product where employees get value by inviting their coworkers has the same potential for (intra-company) virality.</p><h3>🚗 Every channel needs a strategy</h3><p>A channel without a strategy is like a car without gas - it won’t take you anywhere.</p><p>I have two initial growth hypotheses:</p><h4>1.

        <p><span>T</span>he wind shifts. The stench of rotten eggs makes it nearly impossible to breathe and the hot fog clouds my view. I hold my breath and close my eyes, imagining the fog growing thicker, crushing me. Then without warning the wind clears and Iâ€™m enveloped once again in the cold, dry air. The heat feels like a lost dream. I shiver as I analyze my surroundings.</p>

<p>Before me lies a steaming blue spring with concentric rings of green, yellow and dark red. I turn around to see another pool. But the rising fog is so dense, I can only guess at the existence of blue water below. Sometimes I glimpse bubbles boiling from some unknown source. The pools are a small sampling of the 10,000 geothermal features that dot Yellowstoneâ€™s caldera and hint at a mysterious hot spot beneath the crust.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s this alien landscape that makes it surprisingly easy to believe that northwestern Wyoming sits directly above a supervolcano—a behemoth far more powerful than your average volcano, with the capacity to eject more than 240 cubic miles of material.</p>
<p>But why do scientists believe there is a supervolcano hidden below? When I asked Henry Heasler, a park geologist at Yellowstone this question, he waxed philosophical. â€œGood science is nothing more than a progress report,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s what we know at a certain time with the data that we have.â€�</p>
<p>Scientists provided one of the most impressive&nbsp;progress reports yet:&nbsp;They peered deep beneath the Earthâ€™s surface and created the first three-dimensional image of the supervolcanoâ€™s plumbing. Although they had already imaged a plume, which brings molten rock up from deep below the mantle to a region about 60 kilometers below the surface, and a magma chamber about 10 kilometers below the surface, the new work had found the missing link between the two.</p>
<p>A second, 11,200-cubic-mile magma chamber connects the plume to the shallower magma chamber. Itâ€™s 4.5 times larger than its shallow companion and has enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times.</p>
<p>Hsin-Hua Huang, a seismologist from the University of Utah and his colleagues used earthquake data to capture this astonishing image. Itâ€™s similar to an ultrasound, said Heasler. â€œWe have the skin of a surface—of a person—but we want to see whatâ€™s inside.â€� When earthquakes travel through dense, hot spots they slow down. So if a seismic wave reaches a sensor later than expected, scientists know thereâ€™s a low-velocity, and hence denser and hotter, region hidden deep within the Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œIf we were just using one pathway—so one earthquake and one seismometer—we couldnâ€™t be able to tell where along that path that low velocity body was. Weâ€™d have no idea,â€� said co-author Jamie Farrell from the University of Utah. Thatâ€™s where multiple earthquakes and sensors come into play. Huangâ€™s team used 4,849 earthquakes, originating from all parts of the earth, plus 80 seismographs across Yellowstone and beyond, to create a rough three-dimensional picture.</p>
<p>Their study was also the first to combine both worldwide and local earthquakes. Distant earthquakes allow scientists to image deep structures (any earthquakes originating under India or China will first travel through the Earthâ€™s core before reaching the U.S.) and local earthquakes allow for shallow structures. Combining the two let the team image the deep magma chamber for the first time. Given that natural earthquakes, however, are relatively rare events—even in one of the most active areas in the world—they had to collect 30 years worth of data.</p>
<p>But seismic tomography isnâ€™t the only way to peer deep underground. GPS satellites can scour the area searching for any ground movement; gravity satellites can look for any changes in the density below; and ground instruments can sample the heat and gases rising from the geothermal features.</p>

<p><span>A</span>ll methods point to a supervolcano thatâ€™s very much alive. From 1976 to 1984, GPS satellite data showed that the caldera floor was&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB092iB13p13753/abstract">swelling upwardgravity data</a>. To a satellite orbiting directly above the inflow, the Earth will seem to pull on it a little less than expected. Meanwhile ground instruments measured increasing heat and gases rising from the active features.</p>
<p>Then from 1985 to 1995 the caldera sunk back down about 5.5 inches. Magma was either moving out of the system laterally or the shallow reservoir was simply cooling and contracting, letting gases seep through the surface. Later measurements show that the caldera floor is continuing to swell and sink. But scientists still donâ€™t understand the complex interplay between the supervolcanoâ€™s moving parts.</p>
<p>â€œI think our next step—hopefully—is to be able to look at some smaller scale features of how these bigger features are connected to each other,â€� said Farrell. If scientists can determine how the large magma chambers interact with each other, they will better understand how fluids and heat move the Earth. â€œThen we can start looking at how long it would take for enough material to get from the deep to the shallow [reservoirs] and maybe where we are in the volcanic cycle of eruptions. But weâ€™re not quite there yet.â€�</p>
<p>Although past eruptions dot the Earthâ€™s surface from Oregon to Wyoming, itâ€™s hard to infer anything about a future eruption. And Farrell isnâ€™t convinced another super-eruption will happen at all. â€œThe system might be dying,â€� he said. â€œThe Yellowstone hot spot is moving into thicker, colder continental crust. And it takes a lot more energy to burn through that crust than it did the thinner crust that itâ€™s been burning through for the last 17 million years.â€�</p>
<p>But as I watch Yellowstoneâ€™s surface boil over before my very eyes itâ€™s hard to believe that the system deep beneath my feet might one day fade away. And as a geyser before me erupts, shooting steam and water tens of feet into the air, I have to wonder if itâ€™s instead slowly building toward another super-eruption. After all, despite Farrellâ€™s uncertainty, he continued to say: â€œItâ€™s happened in the past, it could happen in the future.â€�</p>

<p>With the release in June of version <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">5.12 “Firework”</a>, OpenNebula went a step further to offer a <strong>pioneering approach</strong> that merges the strengths of an open source Cloud Management Platform with the many benefits of container technologies. Now, by joining the <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</strong>, OpenNebula confirms its commitment to support the deployment and management of containerized applications and Kubernetes clusters, both on premises and through its support for hybrid and edge cloud computing.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://opennebula.io/mastering-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MasteringContainers.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="263" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MasteringContainers.jpg 1000w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MasteringContainers-300x105.jpg 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MasteringContainers-768x269.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Thanks to its cutting-edge integration with <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firecracker</a>, the new virtualization technology developed by <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> and widely used as part of its Fargate and Lambda services, OpenNebula has managed to bridge the gap between two technological worlds, leaving behind the traditional dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.</p>



<p>By <strong>combining virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity</strong>, and thanks to its native integration with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Hub</a>, OpenNebula has become a powerful alternative to <strong>deploy and orchestrate containers as secure and fast microVMs</strong>. This enterprise-ready solution comes with all the features of a solid Cloud Management Platform but without adding extra layers of orchestration, thus <strong>reducing the complexity, resource consumption and operational costs</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition to this new native model for the orchestration of application containers, OpenNebula maintains its publicly available <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://opennebula.io/new-kubernetes-virtual-appliance-for-opennebula/" target="_blank">Kubernetes Virtual Appliance</a> for KVM hosts and is also in the process of adopting <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank">K3s</a> as its default technology for <strong>Kubernetes deployments at the edge</strong>. These additional options provide a simple way to deploy Kubernetes clusters whenever needed, thus helping businesses meet the growing needs of their development teams and DevOps practices while reducing their dependency on third-party vendors and Kubernetes-as-a-Service providers.</p>

        <p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get C up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal C “runtime” (typically called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>Compared to other popular programming languages, which require substantial
runtime machinery to operate (e.g: Java’s virtual machine, Go’s garbage
collector, etc…), C’s extremely minimal approach to language design has
allowed it to run on just about any platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while C is effectively dependency free at the <em>language</em> level,
the same can’t be said about its <em>standard library</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the original title of this post was “C Is Not Dependency Free”. This
title didn’t reflect the actual message I was trying to convey (namely, that
it can be tricky for beginners getting started with freestanding C to know
which methods they can and can’t use), and was disingenuous at best, and
actively misleading at worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep things simple, I’ll be focusing exclusively on C, though it should be
noted that everything here applies to C++ as well. While not a strict superset
of C, C++ inherits most of C’s language design and standard library, making it
equally susceptible to the issues outlined below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Owing to its strong UNIX heritage, the C standard library includes many
functions and features which assume the existence of some sort of underlying OS.
For example, even the humble and ubiquitous <code>printf</code> function relies on the
existence of the <code>write</code> syscall, the idea of file descriptors, the <code>stdout</code>
stream, etc…</p>
<p>When writing bare-metal C code, beginners often absent-mindedly
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> in an effort to do some quick-and-dirty <code>printf</code> debugging.
Unfortunately, while it might appear as though everything is working fine when
compiling individual translation units, things will inevitably come crashing
down at link time. Raise your hand if you’ve ever been hit with a linker error
that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-writer.o): In function `_write_r':
    writer.c:(.text._write_r+0x20): undefined reference to `_write'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-readr.o): In function `_read_r':
    readr.c:(.text._read_r+0x24): undefined reference to `_read'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-exit.o): In function `exit':
    exit.c:(.text.exit+0x2c): undefined reference to `_exit'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-isattyr.o): In function `_isatty_r':
    isattyr.c:(.text._isatty_r+0x18): undefined reference to `_isatty'

/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/lib/libc.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
    sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0x14): undefined reference to `_sbrk'

gcc: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre><p>Oops! Turns out those <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> methods rely on the existence of some
underlying syscalls, but because this is bare-metal code, they’re nowhere to be
found!</p>
<p>But wait, what about
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17692428/what-is-ffreestanding-option-in-gcc"><code>-ffreestanding</code></a>?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t actually mitigate the problem much. Sure, the compiler
won’t use its built-in versions of common standard library routines, but it
won’t stop you from writing <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and trying to use them anyways!</p>
<p>Now, this certainly isn’t the end of the world. It’s entirely possible to
appease the linker by stubbing out
<a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Porting_Newlib#newlib.2Flibc.2Fsys.2Fmyos.2Fsyscalls.c">these syscalls</a>
with some sort of panicking implementation, and working backwards from a crash
to determine which standard library method can’t be used. If you’re lucky, your
toolchain might even include some
<a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/tools-software/tools/f/arm-compilers-forum/44223/what-are-the-compile-option-differences-between---specs-nosys-specs-and---specs-rdimon-specs-in-arm-none-eabi-gcc">built-in</a>
syscall stubs.</p>
<p>In this particular case, it’s pretty obvious why the <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> functions
wouldn’t work when writing bare-metal software. Unfortunately, things aren’t
always so simple.</p>
<p>For example, consider this (admittedly contrived) <code>greet</code> function that only
calls <code>malloc</code> if the input buffer is too small to fit the resulting
string:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s entirely possible that the code will work 99% of the time, but occasionally
fail in the rare case when the buffer is too small, and <code>malloc</code> ends up getting
called. <code>malloc</code> typically relies on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbrk"><code>sbrk</code></a> syscall, which in this case, would
be stubbed out. Depending on how <code>sbrk</code> was stubbed out, The program might crash
with an <code>unimplemented syscall</code> error, or <code>malloc</code> might return a null pointer,
which this code (naively) doesn’t check for (after all, when was the last time
<code>malloc</code> failed on your work PC? /s).</p>
<p>One classic workaround for these sorts of footguns is to forgo the C standard
library entirely, and rewrite every method from scratch. After all, how hard can
it be to
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17591624/understanding-the-source-code-of-memcpy">implement <code>memcpy</code></a>
anyway? And sure, this approach might work fine for the simpler methods, but do
you <em>really</em> want to re-implement something like <code>sprintf</code> yourself? Probably
not.</p>
<p>Things get even hairier when using external C libraries. While many C libraries
proudly market themselves as “dependency-free”, they quite often implicitly mean
that they are <em>external</em> dependency-free, and still rely on the C standard
library internally. That’s not to say that there aren’t any <em>truly</em> dependency
free C libraries as well, there most certainly are. Unfortunately, for a
beginner systems programmer, the distinction between being “external” dependency
free and “truly” dependency free may not always be so obvious.</p>
<p>And so, it’s often the case the C programmers are left with one of two options:
use the standard library and be <em>very careful</em> not to use any methods with
hidden syscall dependencies, or forgo the standard library entirely and re-write
any bits of functionality they require themselves. Neither one of these options
is particularly “ergonomic”, and are far from beginner friendly.</p>
<p>If only the C standard library had a clear “line” between all the
platform-agnostic, dependency free bits of code, and all the platform-specific,
“requires an OS” bits of code…</p>

<p>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn’t take much of anything to
get Rust up and running on a new platform.</p>
<p>In fact, a minimal Rust “runtime” (cheekily called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/r0"><code>r0</code></a>) only consists of a short prelude
that zeroes out the <code>.bss</code> section and hands off execution to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>That’s it!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Just like C, this extremely minimal approach to language design allows Rust to
run on just about any platform (well, assuming there’s
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compiler support</a>
for it).</p>
<p>Where Rust differs from C is with respect to its standard library. Learning from
the mistakes of C, the Rust language team made the excellent decision to split
the standard library into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html"><code>std</code></a>: The full-fledged Rust
standard library, “[offering] core types, like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>,
library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and
multithreading, among many other things.”</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/"><code>core</code></a>: The small <em>dependency-free</em>
foundation of Rust language. <code>core</code> “isn’t even aware of heap allocation,
nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require platform
integration, and [the <code>core</code>] library is platform-agnostic.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This seemingly innocuous implementation detail turns out to be absolutely
<em>incredible</em> for bare-metal programmers, as it makes it possible to entirely
“opt-out” of all the OS-dependent bits of the standard library. By relying on
the <code>core</code> library directly, it’s possible to write truly portable bare-metal
code free of any and all “hidden” syscalls!</p>
<p>Unlike C, which allows separate item declarations and implementations (e.g:
declaring a method in a <code>.h</code> header file, and implementing it in a <code>.c</code> file),
Rust requires that items are implemented at the same time as they are declared,
making it <em>impossible</em> to get a linker error when writing typical Rust
code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>So, how does a “crate” (Rust lingo for library/binary) opt out of the <code>std</code>
standard library? Why, using the handy-dandy top-level <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute!</p>
<p>As the name implies, the <code>#![no_std]</code> attribute signals to the Rust compiler
that the crate shouldn’t link directly with <code>std</code>, and that it should instead
link with the <code>core</code> library directly.</p>
<p><del><code>#![no_std]</code> is also transitive down the dependency graph, so accidentally
including a dependency that relies on <code>std</code> within a <code>no_std</code> project will be
rejected by the compiler</del><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This transitive properly makes
it possible to use <code>cargo</code> (Rust’s built-in package manager) to integrate
external dependencies from <code>crate.io</code>, and be confident that if it compiles, it
won’t inadvertently panic at runtime due to a stubbed out “hidden” syscall
dependency. With Rust, using external dependencies with bare-metal code is not
only possible, but thanks to <code>cargo</code>’s best-in-class dependency management
story, it’s incredibly ergonomic as well!</p>
<p>To really show you the power of <code>no_std</code>, lets revisit the <code>greet</code> function from
the last section. Consider the following Rust implementation, which goes out of
it’s way to be as <code>unsafe</code> and un-idiomatic as possible. This could very well be
a “first pass” implementation from a C programmer just getting their feet wet
with Rust:</p>

<p>If you need to bring a lot of data into your app, a data pipeline can help. This article describes how to build a simple data pipeline with Ruby on Rails, Sidekiq, Redis, and Postgres.</p>



<h2>What’s a data pipeline?</h2>



<p>A data pipeline takes information from one place and puts it somewhere else. It likely transforms that data along the way. In enterprise circles, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>, or extract-transform-load.</p>



<p>Generally, data pipelines:</p>



<ol><li>Ingest a lot of data at once</li><li>Ingest new or updated data on a schedule</li></ol>



<h2>Splitting data into small jobs</h2>



<p>A reliable pipeline starts big and reduces data into small slices that can be independently processed. Bigger jobs “fan out” into small ones. The smallest jobs, handling one record each, do most of the work.</p>



<p>Breaking work into smaller jobs helps handle failure. If the pipeline ingests 1,000,000 records, chances are that a few of them are invalid. If those invalid records are processing in their own jobs, then then they can fail without impacting other records. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a>, a project of mine, ingests <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm">United States lobbying data from the U.S. Senate</a>. There are about 1,000,000 lobbying records from 2010-2020. Processing them all in a single job would be risky, as the entire job would fail if even one record triggered an error. Instead, Lobby Focus breaks down data into small slices and ends up processing each record in its own job. To bring in 1,000,000 lobbying records, it takes 1,001,041 jobs.</p>



<p>Pipelines can handle a ton of jobs with ease. Splitting up work into many small jobs offers advantages:</p>



<ol><li>Most jobs deal with only one record. If a job fails, it’s easy to pin down the problematic record, fix it, and retry it. The rest of the pipeline continues uninterrupted.</li><li>The pipeline can ingest data in parallel, with many small jobs running at once. </li><li>It’s easy to track progress by looking at how many jobs succeeded and how many remain.</li></ol>



<h2>A Ruby on Rails pipeline stack</h2>



<p>This stack, used in the example below, makes for a solid data pipeline:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></strong> interfaces with all the pieces below and has a strong ecosystem of libraries.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a></strong> manages data pipeline jobs, providing visibility into progress and errors.</li><li><strong><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a></strong> backs Sidekiq and stores the job queue.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a></strong> stores intermediate and final data.</li><li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></strong> serves as a staging area for source data.</li></ul>



<p>Managed platforms like <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/">Cloud 66</a> are good hosting options for this stack.</p>



<h2>Real-world example: U.S. Senate lobbying data</h2>



<p><a href="https://lobbyfocus.com/">Lobby Focus</a> ingests lobbying data from the U.S. Senate and makes it accessible to users. Here’s a peek into its data pipeline, which breaks data into small jobs and uses the stack above.</p>



<h3>Step 1: Scrape</h3>



<p><strong>1 Sidekiq job</strong> deals with <strong>1,000,000 records</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> None</p>



<ul><li>Gathers a list of ZIP files from the U.S. Senate, using <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">HTTParty</a> to retrieve the webpage and <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri">Nokogiri</a> to parse it</li><li>Launches a download job for each ZIP file. To ingest lobbying data from 2010 to 2020, it will launch 40 <strong>download</strong> jobs for 40 ZIP’s.</li></ul>



<h3>Step 2: Download</h3>



<p><strong>40 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>25,000 records</strong> <strong>each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> ZIP file URL</p>



<ul><li>Checks the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified">last-modified</a> header to see if the current version was already processed. If so, aborts the job.</li><li>Downloads the ZIP and unzips its contents into Amazon S3, using <a href="https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip">rubyzip</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">aws-s3-sdk</a>.</li><li>Launches a <strong>process</strong> job for each XML file in the ZIP. </li></ul>



<h3>Step 3: Process</h3>



<p><strong>1,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1,000 records each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> XML file URL (S3)</p>



<ul><li>Parses the XML with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Adds the content of each record in the XML file to Postgres, as a raw XML string. </li><li>Launches a <strong>load</strong> job for each record in the XML file, passing the Postgres record ID. </li></ul>



<p>Postgres can bear a high volume of record inserts. The pipeline uses it as an intermediate data store. The next job, <strong>load</strong>, receives the Postgres record ID and accesses it to get the XML string. Using Postgres to pass the XML avoids passing giant parameters between jobs. Sidekiq <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">recommends small job parameters</a> to keep the queue lean and preserve Redis memory.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Load</h3>



<p><strong>1,000,000 Sidekiq jobs</strong> deal with <strong>1 record each</strong></p>



<p><strong>Parameter:</strong> Postgres record ID</p>



<ul><li>Retrieves the XML string from Postgres and parses it with <a href="https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html">Nokogiri</a></li><li>Validates data and aborts the job with an error if there is an issue</li><li>Upserts final data record into Postgres</li></ul>



<h2>Staying resilient</h2>



<p>Breaking out data loads into small jobs is key to a resilient pipeline. Here are some more tips:</p>



<h3>Make jobs idempotent</h3>



<p>Any job should be able to run twice without duplicating data. In other words, jobs should be idempotent.</p>



<p>Look for a unique key in the source data and use it to avoid writing duplicate data. </p>



<p>For instance, you can set a Postgres unique index on the key. Then,  use Rails’ <a href="https://blog.bigbinary.com/2019/03/25/rails-6-adds-create_or_find_by.html">create_or_find_by</a> method to create or update a record, depending on whether the key already exists.</p>



<h3>Use constraints to reject invalid data</h3>



<p>Set constraints to stop invalid data from coming in. If a field should always have a value, use a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/ddl-constraints.html">Postgres constraint</a> to require that field. Use Ruby’s strict <a href="https://avdi.codes/a-ruby-conversion-idiom/">conversion methods</a> to throw an error and abort a job if you’re expecting one data type (say, an integer like 3) but get another (say, a string like “n/a”).</p>



<p>Data is never perfect. If you catch invalid data errors early, you can adjust your pipeline to handle unexpected values.</p>



<h2>What to read next</h2>



<p>A job management library like Sidekiq is critical to a data pipeline. Read more about <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a>, the backbone of this example. Its <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Best-Practices">best practices docs</a> are small and useful. If you’re not using Ruby, find the top job management libraries for your language.</p>



<p>To practice creating a pipeline, find a public dataset that interests you and build a pipeline for it. The United States Government, for instance, lists its open government data on <a href="https://data.gov/">data.gov</a>. Datasets range from <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/data/physician-compare">physician comparison data</a> and a <a href="https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/ords/f?p=105:19:7020640354040::NO:::">database of every dam in the U.S</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, check out managed solutions like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Dataflow</a> for particularly large pipelines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Substrate</strong> is a blockchain framework built in Rust, with off-chain worker capabilities.
<br><strong>IPFS</strong> is a distributed file storage network, connecting peers and their content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By including <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ifps">the Rust implementation IPFS</a> in the native
Substrate runtime, and by allowing pass-through wasm calls via Substrate's
<a href="https://www.substrate.io/kb/learn-substrate/off-chain-workers">Off-chain Workers</a>, we enable a powerful and familiar subset of the IPFS APIs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ipfs add</code> - Write data to IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs cat</code> - Read data from IPFS</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findpeer</code> - Discover peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs dht findprovs</code> - Discover content</li>
<li><code>ipfs swarm connect</code> / <code>disconnect</code> - Swarm with other IPFS peers</li>
<li><code>ipfs pin add</code> / <code>rm</code> - Pin and unpin content</li>
</ul>
<p><code>offchain::ipfs</code> allows you to account for your data transactions and DHT status in the blockchain.
These on-chain insights can serve as a foundation for incentivized data storage and replication.
This means <em>no separate executable</em>: both blockchain and distributed storage are together in one.</p>
<p>The <code>offchain::ipfs</code> Manual is the documentation of our efforts, as well as useful explanations
and code examples to get you started using this technology. Due to <code>offchain::ipfs</code> being a
well-maintained fork of <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate">paritytech/substrate</a>, this manual also stands in as typical
documentation, such as docs.rs and README.md files.</p>

<p>You should still consider this an <strong>alpha preview</strong>.</p>
<p>The primary value of this work is the embedded IPFS node itself. The pallet included in the

<p>A new player has entered the world’s largest untapped mobile money market. Last week, India’s state-backed authority gave WhatsApp the green light to roll out its digital-payments service after almost two years of regulatory delay. The company is now able to offer its service to 20 million new users, about 5% of its more than 400 million users in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg heralded the decision in a video message. “Now you can easily send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKF3PKmTIx0">he said</a>. “There is no fee. It’s supported by 140 banks.” All an Indian user needs is a debit card with an authorized bank to set up payments.</p>



<p>WhatsApp Pay is built on India’s state-backed digital-payments system, a 2016 innovation meant to make digital payment as universal as electricity. But the innovation came at the cost of local digital wallets. Today, about 80% of payments on the government-backed interface are made through Google or Walmart. WhatsApp’s entry into India will challenge the dominance of these two giants, but critics argue it all but guarantees that Indian fintechs will be stamped out by foreign players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up until 2017, digital wallets reigned supreme in India. The Indian government’s 2016 decision to cancel 86% of cash in circulation drove millions to adopt them, and local fintech companies reaped the benefits: SoftBank- and Alibaba-backed Paytm saw its digital wallets grow from 125 million to more than <a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/b15ts6qpxvj51d/how-paytm-went-big-on-indian-demonetization">185 million</a> within three months of India’s move to demonetize, and the Sequoia-backed MobiKwik witnessed a <a href="https://qz.com/844564/from-paytm-to-mobikwik-a-7000-increase-and-other-wtf-numbers-thrown-up-by-indias-digital-payment-firms-post-demonetisation/">40% jump</a> in downloads within days. But the euphoria for Indian digital wallets was short-lived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016, India’s digital-payments authority, NPCI, introduced a new payment system called the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Unlike Paytm or MobiKwik, UPI apps didn’t require users to create new wallets; consumers and merchants alike could make payments directly from their bank accounts. Although it launched in the same year as the government’s demonetization campaign, UPI wasn’t widely adopted until 2017.</p>



<p>For customers, the new platform was a fast and seamless option; for digital wallets, it made their services obsolete overnight. Legacy banks, long weary of companies like Paytm, quickly bought into UPI. It led to unprecedented digital adoption: There was a <a href="https://razorpay.com/blog/the-era-of-rising-fintech-digital-payments-growth/">300% increase</a> in digital payments in 2019. Wallet transactions, though, <a href="https://razorpay.com/blog/the-upi-wars-whos-the-boss/">declined</a> from 96%&nbsp;of digital transactions in 2016 to a little over 30% in 2018.</p>



<p>“UPI was to payments what electric vehicles were to combustion engines,” said Sharad Sharma, co-founder of iSPIRT, an Indian think tank that promoted the UPI. “People in the old business of digital wallets, with their captive audience, were slower to move,” he said. The challenges for digital-wallet players like Paytm were steep: They had to invest several billion dollars to incentivize adoption, while at the same time jumping through hoops for licenses from regulators. By contrast, UPI apps were lightly regulated and built on top of a preexisting platform. These “wrapper” apps only controlled user information, while money flow was controlled by the banks.</p>



<p>The opportunity UPI presented drew the interest of global giants. In 2017, Google launched Google Pay in India. In 2018, WhatsApp began offering trial versions of WhatsApp Pay to 1 million users, but it quickly ran into a web of controversies stemming from concerns <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2020/06/223-whatsapp-pay-affidavit-good-governance-chambers/">over data privacy</a>.</p>



<p>In the two years WhatsApp Pay languished in regulatory limbo, its competitors covered a lot of ground. Google introduced scratch cards that gamified their transactions on Google Pay, a model that resulted in widespread adoption, though many users engaged in dummy transactions to try their luck at winning coupons. The strategy proved to be lucrative, and ultimately secured Big Tech’s preeminence in India’s digital-payments market. In 2019, Google alone spent more than <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-pay-spent-rs-1028-crore-for-cashback-in-fy19/articleshow/71803214.cms">$140 million in cash-backs</a> and garnered 67 million customers. Walmart-owned PhonePe, originally an Indian startup, drew users to its platforms with similar gimmicks.</p>

<p>Within three years, multinational tech companies had divided up the UPI market: As of October 2020, PhonePe and Google Pay had 40% and 38% of the market share, respectively. Even Paytm, the old leader in digital wallets, embraced UPI, but its deep-pocketed competitors Google and Walmart continued to spend money on cash-backs to attract more users. Between 2016 and 2018, many local e-wallet companies, including <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/05/04/indias-digital-platforms">Trupay</a> shut down, and several others, like Chillr, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/truecaller-acquires-payments-startup-chillr/articleshow/64579911.cms">merged</a> with their competitors. Local media outlets called UPI “<a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/upi-rise-changes-life-for-fintech-startup-trupay/article9511103.ece">the e-wallet killer</a>.”</p>



<p>Bipin Preet Singh, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Industry/AkI6PwPp6D3LB3rmbz6hpK/The-coming-UPI-battle-in-mobile-payments.html">MobiKwik, witnessed its value crumble</a> from $327 million to $269 million. “It impacted growth because UPI opened up the market for Google,” Singh said. Despite raising more than a $100 million from marquee investors, MobiKwik was <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/end-of-the-road-for-mobikwik-the-mobile-wallet-is-walking-a-tightrope/articleshow/64593489.cms">squeezed</a> out and overtaken by UPI players Google and PhonePe. “The open market has disadvantaged us,” said Singh. Even the government’s own UPI app, BHIM, couldn’t compete with the aggressive cash-backs offered by foreign companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nikhil Kumar, the engineer who led the team that built the UPI, said Big Tech’s lead in India’s digital payments comes as a surprise. “We never expected this to be the equation, where it would become a FAANG fight,” he said, using the acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. “We hoped a lot of Indian entrepreneurs would build multiple apps where it would spur a lot of local innovation,” Kumar said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UPI’s creators had envisioned a future of multiple specialized payments apps: for women-first payments, children-first payments, a hyper-secure variant for the armed forces, etc. “Having hundreds of interoperable apps was the vision,” said Kumar. “But it gradually began to get concentrated.”</p>



<p>“The concentration aspect was never looked into because, at that time, all they wanted was growth,” said Srikanth Lakshmanan, founder of Cashless Consumer, a consumer protection collective for digital payment services. “For NPCI, the overall growth of the platform was important, and for that, Big Tech’s adoption was paramount.”<br></p>



<p>To make matters worse for competing smaller companies, regulators forbade apps from charging for transactions. “There is no revenue model here for smaller companies,” said Anand Lunia, an Indian venture capitalist and outspoken critic of Big Tech’s influence in India. “Google offered cash-backs and discounts to grow users, and the market was cornered by deep-pocketed companies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hundreds of UPI apps operated by banks and other smaller payment companies, but all of them combined account for only about 20% of the market. Still, Google’s and Walmart’s adoption efforts can’t be undervalued, as even Kumar, the UPI engineer, conceded. “You cannot ignore the fact that it’s actually the adoption of Big Tech and their aggressive promotion that led to this exponential growth of UPI,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To account for potentially lopsided growth, India’s digital payments regulator has declared that no single player may account for more than 30% of the total volume of transactions beginning in 2023. The cap leaves a lot to be answered. “What would happen if a player hit the 30% quota for the day? Would transactions start failing? How’s the cap beneficial if the user is not served? And why isn’t there concentration risk on the bank side?” asked Lakshmanan of Cashless Consumer.</p>



<p>Google has already expressed its displeasure with the government’s decision to install market caps. “Digital payments in India is still in its infancy,” said Sajith Sivanandan, a Google Pay India executive, in a statement. “This announcement has come as a surprise and has implications for hundreds of millions of users who use UPI for their daily payments and could impact the further adoption of UPI and the end goal of financial inclusion.”</p>



<p>But for local digital wallets looking for a share of the market, the caps are too little, too late. “Let’s be honest: UPI isn’t a small-player game anymore,” said former Paytm executive Deepak Abbot. “No small player can compete. That ship has sailed.”</p>



<p>For Zuckerberg and Facebook, the entry into the market is a big win.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                
<p>Nothing can truly prepare you for <a href="https://fertilityroad.com/are-you-prepared-for-the-path-to-parenthood/">parenthood</a>. You could read every parenting book on the planet and still feel completely overwhelmed the moment you first hold your baby in your arms. In the first few weeks, you barely have time to think, let alone sleep or eat. Once you start to fall into a routine, however, reality sets in. Once you become a parent, there is no going back.</p>



<p>For many, there is no greater joy than bringing life into the world. Some people are born to be parents and they happily change their lives for the good of their children. For others, however, parenthood comes as a surprise or they find the reality is much different than the expectation. Many parents regret having children, and, for some, the feeling is not fleeting.</p>



<p>Whether you’re experiencing parental regret with a newborn baby, a teething toddler, or a moody teenager, your feelings are valid. Here’s what you need to know about parental regret along with some useful tips to help you cope with it.</p>



<p><strong>What is Parental Regret?</strong></p>



<p>Once you have children, your life changes. You no longer have the freedom to make choices solely based on your own needs or preferences. For many people, <a href="https://fertilityroad.com/couple-embark-on-journey-to-become-parents-for-second-time/">becoming a parent</a> is the height of happiness and the key to a fulfilling life. For others, however, welcoming a new life into the world is accompanied by a sense of loss for the life they once or could have lived.</p>



<p>Parenthood can be exhausting. By the time you get the kids through their homework, fed, bathed, and into bed, you’re too tired to even think about everything that needs to be done around the house. You find yourself living in a haze of endless responsibility with little time to yourself. Forget taking an impromptu weekend trip or even going out to dinner without reserving a sitter two weeks ahead.</p>



<p>Many parents gladly give up some of their personal freedoms for a life of responsibility – the experience of parenthood is its own reward. According to<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1588/children-violence.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a 2018 Gallup poll</a>, however, 8% of parents in the United States report that they would choose not to have children if they could do their lives over. The reality is that number could be higher if admitting to the challenge and emotional struggle of parenthood weren’t so taboo. Parental regret is very real but many feel like they experience it alone.</p>



<p><strong>Exploring Potential Causes of Parental Regret</strong></p>



<p>The underlying causes of parental regret are different in most cases. Some parents regret the timing, wishing they’d had more opportunity to pursue their education or further their career before having children. For others, regret can be tied to the number of children they’ve had, the partner they’ve had them with, or difficulties with the children themselves such as illness or disability.</p>



<p>We are all shaped by our experiences in life, so take the time to consider all the various factors which may be contributing to your current feelings around being a parent. Here are some to consider:</p>



<ul><li>Your upbringing and relationship with your own parents</li><li>Your past and current mental or physical health</li><li>Your access to emotional support</li><li>Your relationship with your child’s other parent</li><li>Your child’s age, temperament, and behavior</li><li>Your current career and financial situation</li></ul>



<p>The key to coping with parental regret is to acknowledge it rather than denying it and hoping it will resolve on its own. It may help to start a journal where you can keep track of your thoughts and work through your emotions. At the very least, it will be a stepping stone toward having a conversation with your partner or seeking help to learn how to cope.</p>



<p><strong>Tips for Coping with Parental Regret</strong></p>



<p>Regret is a perfectly normal emotion and one we all feel from time to time. You can’t control your feelings, but you can choose how you react to them. Denying your parental regret could make matters worse and may prevent you from experiencing the joy and satisfaction that can come from being a parent. It’s rare that you’ll find a parent that enjoys the job 100% of the time, but you shouldn’t have to live your life wishing you’d made a different decision. The past is behind you, but you have the power to shape your future.</p>



<p>Here are some helpful tips for coping with parental regret:</p>



<p><strong>1. Find a safe space to share</strong>. Regret is a difficult emotion to process, so you may not be ready to share your feelings with someone close to you just yet. Find a safe space to share your feelings anonymously such as an online support group or private Facebook group.</p>



<p><strong>2. Consider virtual therapy</strong>. Talking through your feelings is important but if you’ve experienced disruption to your daily life, you may want to consider treatment. Virtual therapy sessions are affordable and easy to access while<a href="https://www.forhers.com/psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> online psychiatry</a> sites can ensure you get the help you need from home.</p>



<p><strong>3. Talk to your partner</strong>. When you’re ready to share, talk to your partner or a trusted family member or friend. It may be a difficult conversation but sharing with someone who cares about you will help you feel less isolated and you’ll be able to start working through your emotions.</p>



<p><strong>4. Give yourself some time</strong>. Being a parent means putting your child’s needs first, often for years at a time. If you have a partner or friends and family you can rely on, accept offers of help and give yourself permission to do something for yourself from time to time. There’s nothing selfish about self-care and you may just find that a little personal time leaves you feeling brighter and more resilient.</p>



<p><strong>5. Reach out to a professional</strong>. If you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby, reach out to a professional immediately. Use the<a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services</a> (SAMSHA) National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357), to get help right away.</p>



<p>There is no such thing as a perfect parent. Every parent questions their ability and aptitude from time to time, even if they look to you like Supermom or Superdad. It’s normal to feel stressed, overwhelmed, or even regretful about parenthood from time to time. What’s important is that you receive the help you need to overcome these challenges and to give your child the best life possible.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Political divisions and economic weakness affecting the United States has led to continual dysfunction, putting its status as the worldâ€™s economic leader in doubt, according to a number of experts.</p>

<p>The country, already changed by President Donald Trumpâ€™s isolationist policies, has increasingly been turning inward after a bitter election fight and its struggle to gain control over the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, China appears poised to overtake the U.S. as an economic power. Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping was quoted by state media as saying the countryâ€™s economy could double in size by 2035, implying an annual average growth rate of 4.7 per cent. <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/imf-data-shows-virus-will-push-china-gdp-growth-well-beyond-u-s-1.1508650" target="_blank">Bloomberg estimates using International Monetary Fund</a> data show Chinaâ€™s proportion of worldwide growth is on track to be 17 percentage points higher than that of the U.S. by 2025.</p>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1517657-1605279893198-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Reduced globalization due to an 'insular United States' will weigh on Canada: Gord Nixon </p>
        <p>Gord Nixon, former CEO of Royal Bank of Canada and chair of BCE, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss why he believes no matter who takes the White House in the 2020 election, protectionism sentiments are likely to prevail from south of the border and weigh on Canada's economy. </p>
            
</div>

<p>â€œThe biggest winner of a bifurcated U.S. has been China,â€� Gord Nixon, former CEO of Royal Bank of Canada and chair of BNN Bloomberg parent company BCE Inc., said in a recent interview. â€œThe dysfunctionality of the U.S. and [its] withdrawal from international organizations has contributed to the rise of China and the reduction of the U.S. position as a global leader.â€�</p>

<p>Nixon said the U.S. will continue to become more insulated and protectionist, a trend started by Trump under his â€œAmerica Firstâ€� trade policies. Trump, who has stoked tensions with China since taking office, started a trade war that for now has resulted in a phase one trade agreement between both countries.</p>

<p>David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, said that while the rest of the world battles the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, China in the meantime will maintain its fast growth and strong productivity trends.</p>

<p>â€œThe irony of ironies is that China â€“ the epicenter of the coronavirus â€“ is the only country in the world thatâ€™s going to have positive growth next year and probably accelerate to over eight per cent next year,â€� he told BNN Bloomberg in an interview. â€œWithin the next 10 years, I reckon Chinaâ€™s economy will be bigger than Americaâ€™s. Thatâ€™s going to have all sorts of geopolitical consequences and the question will be, what can be done to curb that ascension? I donâ€™t think it can be reversed.â€�</p>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1517624-1605279874239-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Investors should concentrate on hard assets going forward rather than financial assets: David Rosenberg </p>
        <p>David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research, joins BNN Bloomberg to provide his reaction to the U.S. 2020 presidential election outcome. He says that investors are buying back stocks because of less tax risks with Republicans taking the Senate. He also added that Chinese markets are a bonified investment opportunity.  </p>
            
</div>

<p>Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, senior fellow at the University of Alberta's China Institute, said that the fact the U.S. is still reeling from the pandemic could facilitate a shift in global leadership towards China.</p>

<p>â€œIf the U.S. continues on its current trajectory of COVID deaths and the costs to the economy from COVID with major companies failing, I think thatâ€™s very much a possibility,â€� she said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>â€œCertainly China has its act together. Its strategies and plans are extremely comprehensive: Theyâ€™ve got science, technology and innovation plans that are better than what the U.S. has.â€�</p>

<p>McCuaig-Johnston added the more multilateral approach that U.S. president-elect Joe Biden will likely take would help rein in Chinaâ€™s more aggressive foreign policy ambitions and be more effective at addressing human right abuses.</p>

<p>"The U.S. together with other countries is a more effective front than the U.S. running and doing whatever it wants, while other countries try to figure out collectively what they can do,â€� she said.</p>

<p>Former trade advisor to the White House Harry Broadman agrees. He told BNN Bloomberg in an interview that Biden could tap into the fact that other countries such as Canada are having their own problems with China, and create a multilateral front.</p>

<p>â€œThat is [Chinaâ€™s] biggest fear, frankly: that a group of countries gang up on them,â€� Broadman said.</p>

<p>You’ve installed PostgreSQL. Now what? I assume you’ve been given a task that 
uses <code>psql</code> and you want to learn the absolute minimum to
get the job done.</p>

<p>This is both a brief tutorial and a 
quick reference for the absolute least you need to know about <code>psql</code>. 
I assume you’re familiar with the command line and have a rough idea about
what database administration tasks, but aren’t familiar with how to
use <code>psql</code> to do the basics.</p>

<p>View on <a href="https://tomcam.github.io/postgres/">GitHub Pages</a> or directly on <a href="https://github.com/tomcam/postgres/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/">PostgreSQL documentation</a> is incredibly 
well written and thorough, but frankly, I didn’t know where to start reading. This
is my answer to that problem.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints or suggestions please let me know by 
sending your feedback to tomcampbell@gmail.com.</p>

<p>It shows how to do the following at the <code>psql</code> prompt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#opening-a-connection-locally">Start and quit <code>psql</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="#h-help">Get help</a></li>
  <li><a href="#getting-information-about-databases">Get information about databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-database">Create databases</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-table-create-table">CREATE TABLEs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adding-a-record-insert-into">INSERT, or add records to a table</a></li>
  <li><a href="#select">SELECT, to do simple queries</a></li>
  <li><a href="#reference">Reference</a> pointing to the official PostgreSQL documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have access to a live PostgreSQL installation at the moment we still have your back.
You can follow through the examples and the output is shown as if you
did type everything out.</p>

<h2 id="the-psql-command-line-utility">The psql command line utility</h2>

<p>Many administrative tasks can or should be done on your local machine, 
even though if database lives on the cloud.
You can do some of them through a visual user interface, but that’s not covered here. 
Knowing how to perform these operations on the command line means you can script them,
and scripting means you can automate tests, check errors, and do data entry on the command line.</p>

<p>This section isn’t a full cheat sheet for <code>psql</code>.
It covers the most common operations and shows them roughly in sequence, 
as you’d use them in a typical work session.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Before using this section, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user name and password for your PostgreSQL database</li>
  <li>The IP address of your remote instance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="command-line-prompts-on-the-operating-system">Command-line prompts on the operating system</h3>

<p>The <code>$</code> starting a command line in the examples below represents your operating system prompt. 
Prompts are configurable so it may well not look like this. 
On Windows it might look like <code>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL&gt;</code> but Windows prompts are also configurable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ psql -U sampleuser -h localhost
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A line starting with <code>#</code> represents a comment. Same for everything to the right of a <code>#</code>. 
If you accidentally type it or copy and paste it in, don’t worry. Nothing will happen.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>This worked to connect to Postgres on DigitalOcean
<span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span># Password when asked is csizllepewdypieiib</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> mydb

<span># Open a database in a remote location.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> sampleuser <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 21334
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="using-psql">Using psql</h2>

<p>You’ll use <code>psql</code> (aka the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">PostgreSQL interactive terminal</a>) most of all because it’s used to create databases and tables, show information about tables, and even to enter information (records) into the database.</p>

<h3 id="quitting-pqsql">Quitting pqsql</h3>

<p>Before we learn anything else, here’s how to quit <code>psql</code> and return to the operating system prompt.
You type backslash, the letter <code>q</code>, and then you press the Enter or return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Press enter after typing \q
# Remember this is backslash, not forward slash
postgres=# \q
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This takes you back out to the operating system prompt.</p>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-locally">Opening a connection locally</h3>

<p>A common case during development is opening a connection to a local database (one on your own machine).
Run <code>psql</code> with <code>-U</code> (for user name) followed by the name of the database, <code>postgres</code> in this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># Log into Postgres as the user named postgres
$ psql -U postgres
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="opening-a-connection-remotely">Opening a connection remotely</h3>

<p>To connect your remote PostgreSQL instance from your local machine, use <code>psql</code> at your operating system command line.
Here’s a typical connection.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># -U is the username (it will appear in the \l command)</span>
<span># -h is the name of the machine where the server is running.</span>
<span># -p is the port where the database listens to connections. Default is 5432.</span>
<span># -d is the name of the database to connect to. I think DO generated this for me, or maybe PostgreSQL.</span>
<span>$ </span>psql <span>-U</span> doadmin <span>-h</span> production-sfo-test1-do-user-4866002-0.db.ondigitalocean.com <span>-p</span> 25060 <span>-d</span> defaultdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’d enter the password. In case someone is peering over your shoulder, the characters are hidden. After you’ve entered your information properly you’ll get this message (truncated for clarity):</p>

<h3 id="looking-at-the-psql-prompt">Looking at the psql prompt</h3>
<p>A few things appear, then the <code>psql</code> prompt is displayed.
The name of the current database appears before the prompt.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>psql (11.1, server 11.0)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point you’re expected to type commands and parameters into the command line.</p>

<h3 id="psql-vs-sql-commands">psql vs SQL commands</h3>

<p><code>psql</code> has two different kinds of commands. Those starting with a backslash
are for <code>psql</code> itself, as illustrated by the use of <code>\q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>Those starting with valid SQL are of course interactive SQL used to
create and modify PostgreSQL databases.</p>

<h3 id="warning-sql-commands-end-with-a-semicolon">Warning: SQL commands end with a semicolon!</h3>

<p>One gotcha is that almost all SQL commands you enter into <code>psql</code> must end in a semicolon.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example,suppose you want to remove a table named <code>sample_property_5</code>. You’d enter this command:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easy to forget. If you do forget the semicolon, you’ll see this perplexing prompt.
Note that a <code>[</code> has been inserted before the username portion of the prompt, and another
prompt appears below it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=#

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you do, just remember to finish it off with that semicolon:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[postgres=# DROP TABLE "sample_property_5"
postgres=# ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="scrolling-through-the-command-history">Scrolling through the command history</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use the up and down arrow keys to move backwards and forwards through the command history.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-information-about-databases">Getting information about databases</h2>

<p>These aren’t SQL commands so just press Enter after them. Remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When there’s more output than fits the screen, it pauses. Press space to continue</li>
  <li>If you want to halt the output, press <code>q</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-help">\h Help</h3>

<div><div><pre><code># Get help. Note it's a backslash, not a forward slash.
postgres=# \h
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You’ll get a long list of commands, then output is paused:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Available help:
  ABORT                            CREATE USER
  ...
  ALTER AGGREGATE                  CREATE USER MAPPING
  ALTER PROCEDURE                  DROP INDEX
:
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Press space to continue, or <code>q</code> to stop the output.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get help on a particular item by listing it after the <code>\h</code> command.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to get help on <code>DROP TABLE</code>:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \h drop table
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll get help on just tha item:</p>

<pre><code>Command:     DROP TABLE
Description: remove a table
Syntax:
DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="l-list-databases">\l List databases</h3>

<p>What most people think of as a database (say, a list of customers) is actually a table. A database is a set of tables, information about those tables, information about users and their permissions, and much more. Some of these databases (and the tables within) are updated automatically by PostgreSQL as you use them.</p>

<p>To get a list of all databases:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
 visitor   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 markets   | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
 tom       | tom      | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 

</code></pre>

<p>You can get info on a single database by following the <code>\l</code> prompt with its name.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, to view information about the <code>template0</code> database:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l template0
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>postgres=# \l
                                  List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges

<h2 id="remotely-happy">Remotely happy</h2>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to adopt a remote working model. Employees get to
choose where to live independently of where they work and save a lot of time and
money on sometimes long commutes (which is also great for the climate â€“ with all
the focus currently being on Covid 19 we must not forget about the real
existential crisis humanity is facing after all). Companies also benefit as they
can attract the best talent from anywhere and are not limited in terms of who
they can hire by their location.</p>
<p>Yet, even as employees and companies alike are eager to adopt remote work and in
theory all the required infrastructure and tools are available, it is still not
easy to get right. Many teams and companies are struggling to go remote and
yearn for the return of the days of the office. The reality is those days are
not going to come back in many industries though and making remote work a
success is going to be one of the key challenges many companies will be facing
in the coming years.</p>
<p>We have run simplabs as a remote company since the beginning. In the early days,
we faced many of the same challenges other teams are struggling with now. Over
time, we overcame each one, and learned a lot along the way. Today, we have team
members in six countries across Europe with people working from co-working
offices in Berlin, kitchens in Augsburg, sheds in Dublin, or even from a
sailboat in Portugal. And we're not the only ones enjoying the many advantages
of working remotely â€“ 90% of remote workers say they plan to remain remote for
the rest of their careers and 94% would even encourage others to work remotely
as well according to
<a href="https://buffer.com/resources/state-remote-work-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study by Buffer</a> that
was conducted in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="a-remote-culture">A remote culture</h2>
<p>Adopting a remote working model does not necessarily have to mean for everyone
to go remote immediately. It can of course be adopted completely and for
everyone but also partially or incrementally as an option only while still
keeping the office for everyone who likes to continue working from it. However,
it is an allâ€“orâ€“nothing kind of change in terms of working culture regardless of
how many team members will actually be working remotely. Remote work requires
fundamentally different practices when it comes to collaboration and management
and a lot of attention to aspects that are less relevant when the entire team
works from the same location.</p>
<p>Possibly the single most important of these aspects is transparency and the flow
and sharing of information. While diagrams, concepts, or calendars pinned to the
wall (or the sticky-notes sprint board that has turned into a status symbol for
teams that "do agile" in the past years) are reasonable and probably good tools
for sharing information among people that all work from the same location, in a
remote environment, these practices don't work. All information shared in such
ways will be completely invisible for everyone who is not in the office,
excluding remote team members from participating in decision-making processes
and preventing them from effectively contributing to the common goal.</p>
<figure><img alt="Burn down your sticky notes walls" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@1000-79f1f215bf9f7d20d95247c1363bcd23.jpg 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/burn-down-your-sticky-notes-walls@2000-224accf0036ced2f3423fcb4d8bc2ccc.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>While direct communication in the office is not something anyone should
prohibit, all the information and decisions that are made in any conversations
must be made transparent to the entire team. Writing summaries and protocols of
face-to-face conversations or communicating via a chat tool although sitting at
the desk next to the person one is having a conversation with feels strange in
the beginning. It is however a necessary prerequisite for making remote work
work at all and failing to do it properly will alienate remote teammates. In
that way, the pandemic that forced teams to go fully remote all at once at the
same time might even have made the transition easier rather than harder for them
because everyone was in the same position and shared the same perspective.</p>
<h3 id="cultivating-trust">Cultivating Trust</h3>
<p>Another very important cultural aspect to consider when a team goes fully or
partly remote is trust. Many managers' first reaction, when faced with their
teams working remotely, is asking</p>
<p><em>"How can I know my team actually works when everyone is sitting at home?"</em></p>
<p>Just because managers cannot <strong>see</strong> the work happening does not mean it does
not happen. Managers' desire to micro-manage teams is an equally bad habit
regardless of whether the team is remote or not â€“ yet, remote teams seem to
increase that desire, often resulting in managers being on everyone's back
constantly and consistently even more than with all of the team working from the
office. However, the occasional check-in for a status update is just as
interruptive remotely as it is in the office.</p>
<figure><img alt="Direct messages are interruptive and keep people from working" srcset="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@1000-3d75f68182ec16f78066993a31c4d5d6.png 1000w, https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2020-11-16-the-guide-to-making-remote-work-work/slack@2000-c665229d789cffd7a3165c4c44f77a26.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 1000px, 2000px"></figure>
<p>The reality is that remote workers are likely more productive rather than less
as they will find it easier to focus and be less stressed according to the
<a href="https://www.owllabs.com/hubfs/Owl%20Labs%202019%20State%20of%20Remote%20Work%20Report%20PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Remote Work 2019 report by OWLLabs</a>.
Building up that trust and allowing people uninterrupted time to focus while
giving up on micro-management practices is going to be a task for many managers
to learn over the next years.</p>

<p>Working remotely requires adapting a number of infrastructure and tooling. There
are a plethora of great tools available and many companies are even using some
of them already. Which exact tools a team uses is not even so relevant and there
are plenty of options available â€“ mostly those fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>tools for ad-hoc, real-time communication</li>
<li>tools for knowledge management and sharing</li>
<li>tools for organizing work and communicating status</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is important to have tools for all of these use cases, it is equally
important to keep the total number of tools in use to a minimum to prevent
chaos. There is always going to be the new hip tool that everyone wants to try
and doing so often silently makes that new tool part of the de-facto toolset a
team uses, growing that little by little over time. Eventually, teams then end
up with entire landscapes of tools, where nobody knows what kind of information
goes where and although each tool is perfectly good in isolation, in combination
they cause more confusion than they support the team.</p>

<p>Team chat tools like Slack (or Microsoft Teams for the more classic companies)
have seen widespread adoption over the past years and there are only a few
companies that don't use any of those at this point. They have developed into
the backbone for remote work for many teams. While in an office environment,
sending someone or a group of people a chat message saves you having to walk
over to a separate room or building, in a remote environment it is the <strong>only</strong>
way to reach out to someone directly (unless you call the person but who does
phone calls anymore?). What's easy to forget is how interruptive these tools can
be. Sending someone a chat message always implies urgency. Even if we all know
the majority of chat messages we get are in fact not urgent, it's hard to ignore
someone who just starts talking (writing) to you.</p>
<p>While most remote workers experience it is easier to focus, a liberal
communication style on team chat can demolish a lot of that increased focus
again. For effective communication, it is important to be respectful of other
people's time and need to focus on their work. Not everything is urgent all of
the time and justifies notifying a coworker or even a group of people. The fact
that you feel like you need something now doesn't necessarily mean someone else
should stop what they are currently doing to answer you. In many cases, sending
a good old email that is going to be less intrusive and more respectful of the
recipient's time is the better communication option compared to sending the
person a message on team chat asking for something that could totally wait until
tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to keep people in the loop and ensure
transparency of communication when using any kind of communication tool.
Communication that happens via direct messages between two people is invisible
to everyone else, while it might actually be relevant to others as well. As a
rule of thumb, we recommend keeping everything in public channels unless the
topic is strictly confidential or private in nature.</p>
<p>Although the information in public channels will be accessible to everyone, it
is important to understand any real-time communication tool is essentially
ephemeral in nature. While that is not technically correct and most tools do in
fact store all communication indefinitely, even with built-in search
functionality it is practically impossible to find a piece of information you
are looking for that was discussed for example in some Slack channel (you likely
don't even remember which one) the day before. So while team chat is a good
mechanism to communicate among the team in a low effort, informal way, any
information or decisions that are made via it need to eventually make their way
into other, more permanent, and organized systems.</p>
<h4 id="video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</h4>
<p>Besides text-based communication systems, of course, video conferences play a
major role in remote work as well. That way of communication has seen a huge
boost in adoption during the pandemic with everyone isolating at home and many
people using video calls for the first time even (I'm sure everyone had their
<em>"Dad, the camera is pointing on the floor"</em> moments). While late adopters
expectedly struggled with the technology, many remote teams experience similar
problems during their daily work lives. Poor audio or video quality, dogs
barking in the background, calls starting 10min late until everyone has figured
out their setup, etc. are common problems for many teams and have a severe
negative effect on meeting efficiency.</p>
<p>All these problems are easy to prevent when following a number of simple
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be proper audio and video hardware in place. For two or more
people joining a call together that means a proper conference speaker that
ensures people on the other end will be able to hear everyone in the room even
if more than one person …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Terrains are at the heart of every Computer Game - be it Counter-Strike, Age of Empires, or even Minecraft. The virtual world that these games generate is the key to a great gaming experience. Generating terrain, manually, requires a ton of effort and hence it makes sense to auto-generate a pseudorandom terrain using some procedure. In this essay, we take a detailed look into generating pseudorandom one-dimensional terrain that is very close to real ones.</p>

<p>A one-dimensional terrain is a bunch of heights defined at every point along the X-axis. An example of this could be seen in games like Flappy Bird, Galaxy, and many more. Such terrain could also be traced as the skylines of mountain ranges.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189082-70b55e00-2785-11eb-87c0-6d95568f709a.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows a one-dimensional terrain and is taken as a sketch of a distant mountain range. The procedure we define should generate terrains as close to natural ones as possible.</p>

<p>A naive solution to generate a random terrain is by using the <code>random</code> function for each point along the X-axis. The <code>random</code> function yields random values in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code>, and we map these values to the required height, for example <code>[0, 100]</code>.  The 1D terrain generation algorithm using the default random function is thus defined as</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> random

<span><span>def</span> <span>mapv</span><span>(v, ol, oh, nl, nh)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""maps the value `v` from old range [ol, oh] to new range [nl, nh]
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> nl + (v * ((nh - nl) / (oh - ol)))

<span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_naive</span><span>(count)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""returns the list of integers representing height at each point.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> [
        mapv(random.random(), <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>100</span>)
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(count)
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mapv</code> function defined above comes in very handy as it helps us to map value from a source range to a target range. The terrain generation function <code>terrain_naive</code> takes in <code>count</code> as input, suggesting the number of points along the X-axis, and it returns a list of float values representing height at each of the <code>count</code> number of points along the terrain.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99189731-9db74000-2788-11eb-98d3-0138a7378d77.png"></p>
<p>The above illustration shows the plot of the one-dimensional terrain using the above <code>terrain_naive</code> function. The terrain generated using this procedure has a lot of spikes and abrupt changes in height and it clearly does not mimic the terrains in the real world. Real-world terrains, although random, does not have a lot of sharp spikes, instead, the changes in height are very gradual and ensure some degree of smoothness.</p>
<p>In order to bring smoothness to <code>terrain_naive</code> generated terrains, we take a look at a famous estimation technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a> which estimates intermediate values given a bunch of known points.</p>

<p>Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within a range of a discrete set of known data points. Interpolation methods estimate the intermediate data points ensuring a "smoothened" transition from one known point to another. There are several interpolation methods but we restrict our focus to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">Linear</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">Cosine</a> interpolation methods.</p>
<h3>Linear Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation estimates the intermediate points between the known points assuming collinearity. Thus given two known points <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, using linear interpolation, we estimate an intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from <code>a</code> using the function defined below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>linp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu) + b * mu
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the parameter <code>mu</code> ranges in the interval <code>[0, 1]</code> where <code>0</code> implies the point being estimated and interpolated is at <code>a</code> while <code>1</code> implies it is at the second point <code>b</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99184683-d0ead680-276a-11eb-9b4d-6c78dbf3c197.png"></p>
<h3>Cosine Interpolation</h3>
<p>Linear interpolation is not always desirable as the plot sees a lot of discontinuous and sharp transitions. When the plot is expected to be smoother, it is where the Cosine Interpolation comes in handy. Instead of assuming intermediate points are collinear with the known ones, Cosine Interpolation, plots them on a cosine curve passing through the known points, providing a much smoother transition. This is could be seen in the illustration above.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> math

<span><span>def</span> <span>cosp</span><span>(a, b, mu)</span>:</span>
    <span>"""returns the intermediate point between `a` and `b`
    which is `mu` factor away from `a`.
    """</span>
    mu2 = (<span>1</span> - math.cos(mu * math.pi)) / <span>2</span>
    <span>return</span> a * (<span>1</span> - mu2) + b * mu2
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet computes and estimates intermediate point <code>c</code> at a relative distance of <code>mu</code> from the first point <code>a</code> using Cosine Interpolation. Note there are other interpolation methods, but we can solve all major of our use cases using these two.</p>

<p>We can apply interpolation to our naively generated terrain and make transitions smoother leading to fewer spikes. In the real-world, the transitions in the terrain are gradual with peaks being widespread; we can mimic the pattern by sampling <code>k</code> points from the naive terrain which could become our desired peaks, and interpolate the rest of the points lying between them.</p>
<p>This should ideally help us reduce the sudden spikes and make the terrain look much closer to really like. A simple python code that outputs linearly interpolated terrain that samples every <code>sample</code> points from the naive one is as follows</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, sample=<span>4</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates
    Linearly Interpolated terrain on sample data.
    """</span>
    terrain = []

    
    sample_points = naive_terrain[::sample]

    
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(len(sample_points)):

        
        terrain.append(sample_points[i])

        
        
        <span>for</span> j <span>in</span> range(sample - <span>1</span>):
            
            mu = (j + <span>1</span>)/sample
          
            
            a = sample_points[i]
            b = sample_points[(i + <span>1</span>) % len(sample_points)]
            v = linp(a, b, mu)

            

    
    <span>return</span> terrain
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet generates intermediate points using Linear Interpolation but we can very easily change the interpolation function to Cosine Interpolation and see the effect in action. The sampling and interpolating on a naively generated terrain for different values of sample is as shown below</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99227920-e7983880-2811-11eb-9c79-bed5cad2eed3.png"></p>
<p>For each interpolation, the 5 plots shown above are sampled for every <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> points respectively. We can clearly see the plots of Cosine Interpolation are much smoother than Linear Interpolated ones. The technique does a good job over naive implementation but it still does not mimic what we see in the real world. To make things as close to the real-world as possible we use the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle">Superposition</a>.</p>

<p>Sampling and Interpolation are effective in reducing the spikes and making transitions gradual. The concern with this approach is that sudden changes are not really gone. In order to address this situation, we use the principle of Superposition upon multiple such sampled terrains.</p>
<p>The approach we take here is to generate <code>k</code> such terrains with different sampling frequencies and then perform a normalized weighted sum. This way we get the best of both worlds i.e smoothness from the terrain with the least sampled points and aberrations from the one with the most sampled points.</p>
<p>Now the only piece that remains is choosing the weights. The weights and sampling frequency varies by the power of <code>2</code>. The number of terrains to be sampled depends on the kind of terrain needed and is to be left for experimentation, but we can assume it to be 6 for most use cases.</p>
<p>The terrain that samples all the points should be given the least weight as it aims to contribute sudden spikes; and as we increase the sampling frequency by the power of <code>2</code> we increase the weight by the power of <code>2</code> as well. Hence for the first terrain, the scale is <code>0.03125</code> where were sample all the points <code>256</code>, the next terrain is sampled with <code>128</code> points and has a scale of <code>0.0625</code>, and so on till we reach sampled points to be <code>8</code> with scale as <code>1</code>, giving it the highest weight.</p>
<p>Once these terrains are generated we perform a normalized weighted sum and generate the final terrain as shown in the illustration below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99264852-0107a780-2847-11eb-9bd1-2e2994c56028.png"></p>
<p>The illustration above shows 6 scaled sampled terrains with different sampling frequencies along with the final super-positioned terrain generated from the procedure. It is very clear that the terrain generated using this procedure is much more closer to the real world terrain than any other we have seen before. Python code that generated the above terrain is as below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>terrain_superpos_linp</span><span>(naive_terrain, iterations=<span>8</span>)</span> -&gt; List[float]:</span>
    <span>"""Using naive terrain `naive_terrain` the function generates

<p>If the terrain to be generated is needed to be smoother then instead of using Linear Interpolation switch to Cosine Interpolation and the resultant terrain will be much smoother and curvier as seen in the illustration below.</p>

How can we prevent those failures from cascading through the system and from taking up critical resources? </p><p>Enter the <strong>Circuit breaker</strong> pattern. The pattern was popularized in the book Release It by Michael Nygard, and by thought leaders like <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Martin Fowler</a>.</p><p><undefined>

    </undefined></p><p>The idea behind this pattern is very simple: <strong>Failures are inevitable, and trying to prevent them altogether is not realistic</strong>. </p><p>A way to handle these failures is by wrapping these operations into some kind of proxy. This proxy is responsible for monitoring recent failures, and using this information to decide whether to allow the operation to proceed or return an early failure instead. </p><p>This proxy is typically implemented as a state machine that mimics the functionality of a physical <strong>circuit breaker</strong> which my have 3 states:</p><ul><li><strong>Closed:</strong> In this state the circuit breaker lets all the requests go through while keeping track of the number of recent failures, and if the number of failures exceeds a specific threshold within a specific time frame, it will switch to the <strong>Open</strong> state.</li><li><strong>Open:</strong> In this state, any requests are not sent to the external service. Instead we either fail immediately returning an extension, or fall back to a secondary system like a cache.  </li><li><strong>Half-Open:</strong> In this state, a limited number of requests from the application are allowed to pass-through and call our external service. Depending on the result of these requests the <strong>circuit breaker</strong> will either flip to a Closed state or go back to the Open state resetting the counter before trying to open again. </li></ul><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern offers a few key advantages worth noting:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Half-Open</strong> state gives the external system time to recover without getting flooded.</li><li>The <strong>Open</strong> state implementation gives options for how we want to handle failure, whether failing right away or falling back to a caching layer or secondary system. </li><li>This pattern can also be leveraged to help to maintain response times by <strong>quickly rejecting calls</strong> that are likely to fail or timeout. </li></ul><h2>Example</h2><p>For our example, let’s imagine that we have the following scenario:</p><blockquote><p>We are running a job board aggregator that will consume job postings from Github and other sources. However, since we are consuming a few different APIs we run the risk that we will hit a request limit or that an API will be down. </p></blockquote><p>Let’s start by creating an example API connector to <strong>Github Jobs</strong> that retrieves the latest 50 jobs posted:</p><div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> CircuitBreaker<span>.</span>Api<span>.</span>GithubJobs <span>do</span>

If we want to test this we can manually call <code>get_positions</code> in our console:</p><div data-language="elixir"><pre><code>iex<span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> CircuitBreaker<span>.</span>Api<span>.</span>GithubJobs<span>.</span>get_positions

<p>Being a great CTO requires <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">insight and vision in both technology and business</a>. You have to be the perfect combination of a software engineer, manager, and entrepreneur. Besides technical skills, you need knowledge of marketing, project management, and product development. It’s a tough job, but one of the ways I learned to cope was reading…a lot.</p>
<p>Even in the internet era, it can be difficult to find reading material online that’s actually useful. After reading hundreds of books over the past few years, I decided to compile my top picks for startup Chief Technology Officers.</p>
<h2 id="early-stage">Early-Stage</h2>
<p>These books will be best for early-stage CTOs tasked with building an MVP and finding product-market fit. Some of these are classics, but they’re all still applicable today.</p>
<h3 id="crossing-the-chasm-marketing-and-selling-high-tech-products-to-mainstream-customers"><a href="https://amzn.to/2IhnpwT">Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</a></h3>
<p>Although Crossing the Chasm is a bit old, it’s not dated. The book is relevant to the high-tech industry today and shows you how fundamentally new products get introduced to the marketplace. Most interestingly, it shows you how to leap early adopters to the mainstream market.</p>
<p>“This book changed my life and the lives of my clients. I bought it in April 1999 and skimmed it. But it was not until April 2009 that I dug in to learn its secrets. I was simply amazed. The most basic point of this book is that the tactics that serve you well at one stage will sink you in the next, so you better orient yourself properly before shouting and writing big checks.”</p>
<h3 id="the-innovators-dilemma"><a href="https://amzn.to/35fBmV7">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></h3>
<p>The Innovator’s Dilemma is the best-known work of Clayton Christensen, a Harward professor who coined the term “disruptive technologies.” This book explains how big, successful companies can quickly lose their market leadership as new competitors rise and become dominant in the market. The Economist named the book <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/06/30/aiming-high">one of the six most important business-related books ever written</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/35fBmV7"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gpFCbqW.jpg"></a></p>
<p>“I picked up this book after hearing the “innovator’s dilemma” alluded to in several interviews by different CEOs. After reading this interesting piece on business strategy, it is no surprise why executive level management teams enjoy quoting this book. Innovator’s Dilemma is a thoroughly researched investigation into an age-old business phenomenon: How do businesses who were once dominant players in their industry get displaced by smaller, upcoming rivals?”</p>
<h3 id="the-lean-startup"><a href="https://amzn.to/3lfyE7B">The Lean Startup</a></h3>
<p>In this classic startup book, Eric Ries talks about his startup’s failure, caused by spending too much time and energy on the initial product launch. The book helps entrepreneurs in companies of all sizes to adapt and adjust to new technologies before it’s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to developing new ideas in an age where markets change rapidly and quick adaptation is of great importance.</p>
<p>“I have been running a software business for 30 years, and, after reading this book, my eyes were opened to the “system” for starting and growing a business. Eric provides the core processes for identifying, developing, and refining products and the key metrics to use for growing your business. I really appreciated his concepts of validated learning vs. the typical “gut” approach to decision making. I also got a lot of value out of his disdain for vanity metrics. I now feel like I have a framework for improving and growing my business. This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to create products that create value.”</p>
<h3 id="zero-to-one"><a href="https://amzn.to/36hzwlH">Zero to One</a></h3>
<p>Written by legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel, this book teaches you the most critical skill that a startup founder must have - learning to think for himself. He mentions how the next Bill Gates or Larry Page won’t win by mercilessly fighting the competition. Instead, they will win by escaping the competition since their businesses will be unique.</p>
<p>“For starters, going from zero to one or intensive (vertical) progress means doing new things. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something no one else has done. In short, doing new things is wiser than copying things that work. Thiel is best in questioning conventional thinking, for he advises a start-up must question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.”</p>

<p>Packed with unconventional approaches to software design, this book is a source of ideas for anyone working on a web application. It has inspired me to try different approaches to solving familiar problems and taught me to build better, cleaner code overall.</p>
<p>“Not everything in this book will apply to every situation. Our team works for the government as contractors; we are required to produce a lot of documentation to fulfill our contractual obligations. Outside of our paper deliverables, though, this book is spot on with software development. Getting Real isn’t full of theories - it’s full of techniques that work. I know this from my experience. The book was a great help in giving that knowledge to my coworkers as well.”</p>
<h3 id="founders-at-work-stories-of-startups-early-days"><a href="https://amzn.to/3eFyeES">Founders at Work: Stories of Startups’ Early Days</a></h3>
<p>Founders at Work is a collection of interviews with people who founded well-known technology companies. It includes interviews with Steve Wozniak, Max Levchin, Sabeer Bhatia, and other entrepreneurs who made a big impact on the market. I really liked their stories and how they climbed to the top from seemingly simple ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eFyeES"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M6ezJgD.jpg" alt="Founders at Work book"></a></p>
<p>“This book is perfect for anyone interested in entrepreneurship, technology startups, technology companies in general, and business books in general. I’ve read the book once already and now I’m in the middle of reading it a second time. I wish there were an audio version of it.”</p>
<h2 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h2>
<p>One of your most visible roles as a CTO is to solve challenging technical problems as your company grows. Once you’ve built your MVP and started to scale, you have to figure out how to maintain growth and deal with more data and users. In this section, I will include some books that help CTOs solve technical problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-architecture-of-open-source-applications"><a href="https://amzn.to/3nbXB47">The Architecture of Open-Source Applications</a></h3>
<p>I worked with many programmers throughout the years and noticed that many of them make the same mistakes over and over again. One of the best ways to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past is to learn about them. In this book, the authors of 25 well-known open-source applications talk about their software architecture and its evolution over time. It’s a fascinating deep dive into the minds of some brilliant people.</p>
<p>“The book is an excellent collection of architectural/structural sketches of major open-source projects. Many of them are written by the developers or maintainers of these projects and provide invaluable insight into why these projects are structured the way they are. The description of each project is an individual chapter and can be read in isolation.“</p>

<p>Being a CTO, I often encounter problems that seem impossible. Sometimes, I’m not even sure where to start. However, Covert’s book helped me a lot by explaining how to properly break big problems into smaller chunks and solve them step-by-step.</p>
<p>“This is an essential read for knowledge workers because it is the essence of what knowledge workers do. We don’t all need to be IA professionals, but if you do something like engineering or computer programming, this book is part of the “soft skills” we all talk about.”</p>
<h3 id="clean-code-series-by-robert-martin"><a href="https://amzn.to/3eJapvP">Clean Code Series by Robert Martin</a></h3>
<p>Every year, companies spend many hours and even resources on fixing the poorly-written code. In this classic series, Martin explains the difference between good and bad code and provides a totally different view on making an efficient program.</p>
<p>“I’ve been programming for about 17 years and consider myself above average programmer. Yet, this book made me feel like I’m actually a horrible coder. I’ve always gotten my tasks done but I didn’t pay attention to refactoring to clean up the code. I’m already behind and got a demo coming up in a few days. As I’m reading my guilty verdicts on all his ‘bad code’ examples, it inspires me to care about ‘coding’ yet again. It can be fun, and it’s not all about getting the job done.”</p>
<p><em>Note: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/five-takeaways-from-clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software-craftsmanship">I wrote a long review of Clean Code back in 2015</a>, but that review holds up.</em></p>

<p>Every application becomes a data-intensive application if it grows large enough, and building these data-rich applications can be a very tricky job. In this book, Martin Kleppmann explains that although software keeps changing, the principles for handling data remain the same. He also talks about the architecture of well-known websites.</p>
<p>“If you are interested in distributed systems or scalability, this book is a must-read for you. It gives you a high-level understanding of different techniques, including the idea behind it, the pros and cons, and the problem it is trying to solve. A great book for practitioners who want to learn all the essential concepts quickly.”</p>

<p>If you want to learn about state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (HPO), in this article I’ll tell you what they are and how they work.</p>



<p>As an ML researcher I’ve read about and used state-of-the-art HPO algorithms quite a bit and in the next few sections I’m going to share with you what I’ve discovered so far.</p>



<p>Hope you like it!&nbsp;</p>








<h2 id="Approaches">A bit about HPO approaches</h2>



<p>HPO is a method that helps solve the challenge of tuning hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outstanding ML algorithms have multiple, distinct and complex hyperparameters that generate an enormous search space. Plenty of start-ups choose to use deep learning in the core of their pipelines, and search space in deep learning methods is even larger than traditional ML algorithms.&nbsp;Tuning on a massive search space is a tough challenge.</p>



<p>To solve HPO problems, we need to use data-driven methods. Manual methods are not effective.</p>



<p>Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the HPO problem:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="513" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1" alt="HPO" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1024%2C513&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?resize=1536%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/HPO-2.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges</a></em></p>



<p>We will discuss four main, most effective methods.</p>






<h2 id="Bayesian-Optimization">Bayesian Optimization&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To understand BO, we should know a bit about the Grid search and random search methods (explained nicely in <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this paper</a>). I’m just going to summarize these methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say that our search space consists of only two hyperparameters, one is significant and the other is unimportant. We want to tune them to improve the accuracy of the model. If each of them has 3 distinct values, the whole search space would be 9 possible choices. We could try each of them to find the best value for both hyperparameters.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="325" height="352" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?resize=325%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="grid layout" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?w=325&amp;ssl=1 325w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/grid-layout.png?resize=277%2C300&amp;ssl=1 277w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization</a></em></p>



<p>But as you can see in the figure above, Grid search was unable to find the best value for the important hyperparameter. One solution for this may be to go through the search space at random, much like the figure below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="309" height="360" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?resize=309%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="random layout" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?w=309&amp;ssl=1 309w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/random-layout.png?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<h3><strong>Why is Bayesian Optimization effective?</strong></h3>



<p>The Random search eventually converges to the optimal answer, but this method is just such a blind search! Is there a smarter way to search? Yes – Bayesian optimization, suggested by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-38527-2_55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">J.Močkus</a>. You can find more information about BO in this <a href="https://static.sigopt.com/b/20a144d208ef255d3b981ce419667ec25d8412e2/static/pdf/SigOpt_Bayesian_Optimization_Primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bayesian Optimization Primer</a>, and in <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms</a>.</p>



<p>In essence, Bayesian optimization is a probability model that wants to learn an expensive objective function by learning based on previous observation. It has two powerful features: surrogate model, and acquisition function.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=512%2C498&amp;ssl=1" alt="hyperparameter optimization" width="512" height="498" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=1024%2C996&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?resize=768%2C747&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/hyperparameter-optimization.png?w=1388&amp;ssl=1 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Image from the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hyperparameter Optimization</a> chapter of the AutoML book by Matthias Feurer, Frank Hutter</em></p>



<p>In the figure above, you can see a nice explanation for Bayesian optimization based on the Hyperparameter Optimization chapter in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05318-5_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automated Machine Learning</a>. In this figure, we want to find the true objective function which is shown as a dashed line. Imagine we have one continuous hyperparameter, and in the second iteration we observed two black points, then we fitted a surrogate model (regression model) that is the black line. The blue tube around the black line is our uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also have an acquisition function, which is the way we explore the search space for finding the new observation optimum value. In other words, the acquisition function helps us improve our surrogate model and select the next value. In the image above, the acquisition function is shown as an orange curve. An acquisition max means where the uncertainty is max and predicted value is low.</p>






<h3><strong>Pros and cons of Bayesian Optimization</strong></h3>



<p>The most important advantage for bayesian optimization is that it can operate very well with black box function. BO is also data efficient and robust with noise. But it can’t work well with parallel resources duo, because&nbsp;the optimization process is sequential.</p>

<h2 id="Algorithms">Multi Fidelity Optimization</h2>



<p>In the Bayesian method, estimation of the objective function is very expensive. Is there any cheaper way to estimate the objective function? Multi Fidelity optimization methods are the answer. I’ll tell you about:</p>



<ol><li>Successive halving</li><li>HyperBand</li><li>BOHB</li></ol>



<p>As an extra resource, in the following video Andreas Mueller explained multi fidelity optimization methods very nicely.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqtTHRwa8dE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>

<h2>Successive halving</h2>



<p>Successive halving tries to give the most budget to the most promising methods. It assumes all configuration could be stopped early and validation score could be obtained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you have N different configurations and ß budget (for example time). In each iteration, as you can see in the below image, successive halving keeps the best halve of the configurations and discards half of the algorithms that are not good. It will continue until we have just one single configuration. This method will be finished when it reaches the maximum of its budget.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Successive-halving.gif?resize=768%2C348&amp;ssl=1" alt="Successive halving" width="768" height="348" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Successive-halving.gif?resize=1024%2C464&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Successive-halving.gif?resize=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Successive-halving.gif?resize=768%2C348&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Successive-halving.gif?resize=1536%2C696&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Figure from <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog-2nd-automl-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automl.org</a></em></p>



<p>Successive halving was originally proposed in <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/jamieson16.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization</a>, written by Kevin Jamieson and&nbsp;Ameet Talwalkar.</p>



<h3><strong>What is the problem with successive halving?</strong></h3>



<p>In successive halving there is a trade-off between how many configurations we need to select at start and how many cuts we need. In the next section you’ll see how Hyperband solves this issue.</p>






<h2>HyperBand&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This method is an extension on top of successive halving algorithms, suggested as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Novel Bandit-Based Approach to Hyperparameter Optimization</a> by Lisha Li and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I mentioned that the successive halving method suffers from a trade off between selecting the number configurations and allocating the budget. To solve this problem, HyperBand proposed to frequently perform the successive halving method with different budgets to find the best configurations. In the below figure you can see HyperBand has better performance in comparison with random search.</p>

<h2>BOHB</h2>



<p>BOHB is a state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithm, proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale</a>, written by Stefan Falkner, Aaron Klein, and Frank Hutter. The idea behind the BOHB algorithm is based on one simple question – why do we run successive halving repeatedly?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of a blind repetition method on top of successive halving, BOHB uses the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. In fact, BOHB combines HyperBand and BO to use both of these algorithms in an efficient way. Dan Ryan explains the BOHB method in his presentation perfectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Add it to your watch list</a>.</p>

<p><em>A great <a href="https://youtu.be/IqQT8se9ofQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation</a> by Dan Ryan about Efficient and Flexible Hyperparameter Optimization on PyData Miami 2019</em></p>



<p>BOHB is a multi fidelity optimization method, and these methods depend on budget, so finding a consequential budget is important. On the other hand, BOHB is robust, flexible, and scalable. If you need more detailed info, you may want to check the official <a href="https://www.automl.org/blog_bohb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> about BOHB by André Biedenkapp and Frank Hutter.</p>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> is a nice implementation of BOHB and HyperBand. You can find its documentation <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/optimizers/bohb.html">here</a>.</p>






<h2 id="Comparison">Random Search vs HyperBand vs BOHB + Results comparison in Neptune</h2>



<p>Now that we know the descriptions and are familiar with the methods, let’s use <a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/mjbahmani/HyperBand-BOHB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neptune</a> to make some experiments and comparisons based on these methods.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along with me:</p>



<ul><li>Install <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> on your machine</li><li>Use the example from <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link</a>.</li><li>Set your configuration budget.</li><li>Do the same experiment for each optimizer.</li><li><a href="https://docs.neptune.ai/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Track the experiments with Neptune.</a></li></ul>



<p>Since I decided to do the experiment on an equal basis, I used <a href="https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HpBandSter</a> which has an implementation for BOHB, with HyperBand and RandomSearch as an optimizer. An official example can be found <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_mnist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. Based on this example, we have a small CNN in Pytorch which will be tuned for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MNIST</a> dataset. I ran this example based on three different optimizers:</p>



<ol><li>BOHB&nbsp;</li><li>HyperBand&nbsp;</li><li>RandomSearch.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>For each optimizer I used the following budgets:</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Configurations</th>
    <th>Range value</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Min budget</td>
    <td>[1]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max budget</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,5]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of iteration</td>
    <td>[1,2,3,4,8,10]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>






<p>It means that we have run different combinations, at least 26 experiments to examine the capabilities of optimizers (BOHB, Hyperband, Random Search). In addition, through this example we want to find the best configuration for CNN based on the following hyperparameters.</p>




<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter name</th>
    <th>Range</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning rate</td>
    <td>[1e-6, 1e-2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of conv layers</td>
    <td>[1,3]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of filters in the first conf layer</td>
    <td>[4, 64]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dropout rate</td>
    <td>[0, 0.9]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Number of hidden units in fully connected layer</td>
    <td>[8,256]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<p><em>Configuration taken from <a href="https://automl.github.io/HpBandSter/build/html/auto_examples/example_5_pytorch_worker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hpbandster documentation</a></em></p>



<p>After running these experiments with various configurations in Neptune, I got some insightful results.</p>

<p>Here you can see a nice contrast between those optimizers for n_iteration=3 and max_budget=3. I find that if I increase the number of iterations, all optimizers finally get best performance, but when the budget is significant, BOHB could do it better.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="589" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neptune-hyperband-bohb-comparison.png?resize=602%2C589&amp;ssl=1" alt="Neptune hyperband bohb comparison" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neptune-hyperband-bohb-comparison.png?w=602&amp;ssl=1 602w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neptune-hyperband-bohb-comparison.png?resize=300%2C294&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even the best founding teams in the world have a lot of trouble deciding on a name for their startup.</p><p>While he admits that finding the right name probably isn’t going to mean the difference between failure and success, even Patrick Collison struggled to find the right name. They started out with the name slashdevslashfinance! When they had to celebrate the times someone <em>correctly</em> pronounced their name, they realized that they would need to find a better one. They resorted to methods like turning to random pages in books and writing a script to run through potential names and check if the domain was available. Stripe happened to be on that list and was on sale for under $20,000.</p><p><img src="https://atay.me/images/stripe.jpg" alt="img"></p><p>That was in 2012. It’s gotten even harder. Since then, all 4-letter and the vast majority (if not all) of dictionary word domains are already taken. Chances are your top choices for names are either taken by a company doing something similar, well established by someone else, or too expensive. That means you’re going to have to gather all your creative juices in order the think of something different.</p><p>Does it matter? Yes. Finding the right name <em>does</em> matter. In a world where there may already be dozens of companies or projects competing for the same customers, the right name can help yours be more memorable. It’s the first thing they hear about your startup and whether you like it or not, the sound of the name invokes some sort of feeling. Whether those feelings are good or bad is up to you.</p><h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-name">What to look for in a name</h2><p>When I look for a name, I make sure it follows the following rules (with a bit of bending):</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> be simple.</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> be short. Anything more than 8-10 letters is pushing it.</p><p>The name <strong>must</strong> pass the phone test. If you were to call up a friend and tell them to go to ________.com and they ask how it’s spelled, it has failed the test.</p><p>The name <strong>should</strong> be unexpected/fun.</p><p>The name should be <strong>somewhat</strong> descriptive of what you do, but this isn’t a requirement.</p><p>And finally, you <strong>should</strong> have a great domain name. We’ll get to this soon.</p><p>That’s a lot for one name to live up to! It’s a daunting task but it is important.</p><p>I start by writing down all the single words that could be the name of the startup, or are related to what the startup does. They can be long or short, available or taken. It doesn’t matter at this stage. Just get them down.</p><p>Then, start combining them to try to form something that sounds good using a spreadsheet or a site that does it for you.</p><p>One thing I try to notice is when words can be merged. For example, if you have a word on your list ending in -me and a word starting me- that could be complimentary, try putting them together. However, this often breaks the phone test rule.</p><p>There are some other tools I use that lead me in the right direction.</p><p><a href="https://thesaurus.com/">Thesaurus</a> - Pretty self explanatory. Enter a word and get words with a similar meaning. Add interesting ones to your master list.</p><p><a href="https://rhymezone.com/">RhymeZone</a> - Some people aren’t fans of names that have two parts that rhyme, but I think it helps people remember them.</p><p><a href="https://leandomainsearch.com/">Lean Domain Search</a> - What I really like about this site is that its a name finder and domain checker in one. You enter a word, and it suggests domains with your word plus another, either at the beginning or end. You can also search by length which is helpful in getting short names.</p><p><a href="https://morewords.com/">More Words</a> - The particular pages I like are <a href="https://www.morewords.com/words-that-start-with/cat">words that start with</a>, <a href="https://www.morewords.com/end-with/cat">words that end with</a>, and <a href="https://www.morewords.com/contains/cat">words that contain</a>. For example, if you were starting a cat walking service, you would search for words starting in “cat”. Catwalk comes up. Too literal probably. But you get the point.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_culinary_herbs_and_spices">Wikipedia</a> - I’ll often look through lists of things like foods, spices, animals, plants depending on the product.</p><p><a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/">Random Word Generator</a> - This one is a bit of a long shot, but there are tens of thousands of English words and sometimes we forget some. Remember to look in nouns <em>and</em> adjectives.</p><p><strong>Google Searches</strong></p><p>phrases related/containing to “______”</p><p>There are also websites that spit out name possibilities, but I don’t think naming startups is going to be taken over by an algorithm anytime soon. It’s just too nuanced. Would an algorithm have come up with the name Twitter? Unlikely.</p><h2 id="domains">Domains</h2><p>If just coming up with a name for your startup wasn’t hard enough, finding a proper domain name can be even harder. Now, the name itself is more important than the domain name, so you can make some sacrifices on the domain name.</p><p>Chances are you can’t afford your dream domain name right now, and that’s ok. There are some ways you can get around it until you can afford it (at which time, if you’re successful, it will be very expensive).</p><p>For example, when Buffer was created, they called their app/company Buffer but settled for bfffr.com (definitely not ideal) and then moved to bufferapp.com (better) until they were finally able to secure buffer.com.</p><p>Lots of other successful companies have done this as well, including Facebook and Twitter. Twitter absolutely nailed the name and it’s one of the reasons they’re so successful.</p><p>Some of the best advice about this issue is from Marc Köhlbrugge. I return to this time and again whenever I’m naming a project:</p><blockquote>— Marc Köhlbrugge (@marckohlbrugge) <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1147061790498598914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2019</a></blockquote><p>His advice is that you can only have two parts of your domain that need to be remembered. (Ideally just one):</p><p>Either</p><ul><li>a dictionary word + Non-standard TLD like .co .io or .app</li><li>a dictionary word + prefix/suffix + .COM</li></ul><p>Since the name itself is more important, you can try adding a prefix or suffix onto the name to get a domain.</p><p>For example:</p><h5 id="experiment-with-prefixes">Experiment with prefixes</h5><p>get-</p><p>use-</p><p>hello-</p><p>hi-</p><p>meet-</p><h5 id="experiment-with-suffixes">Experiment with Suffixes</h5><p>-app</p><p>-ly</p><p>-list</p><p>-hq</p><h2 id="tlds">TLDs</h2><p>In my opinion, .com is still king. If you can grab one of these for a name you like, that’s probably your winner. If not and you’re a tech company catering to a techie audience, .co, .io, or .app can do. Anything else I would try to stay away from.</p><p>Does it matter? <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain">According to Moz</a> it does. That’s all the authority you need on the topic.</p><p>As for how I’ve used some of these methods and guidelines? Here are some of the names I’ve come up with for my side projects and startups:</p><p><strong>CoVisitor</strong> -
An app that helps store owners keep track of their visitors during COVID-19</p><p><strong>TasteJury</strong> -
A site that lets people collectively decide on the best place to get certain dishes in a city.</p><p><strong>Open Sukkah</strong> -
“Airbnb for Sukkahs” - lets people open their sukkahs to people who want to use them.</p><p><strong>WhatsDue</strong>
A task management app for teachers, students, and parents</p><hr><p>Need help naming your startup or side project? Shoot me an email and I’m happy to brainstorm with you.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-cover.png" alt="Cover image"></p><blockquote><p>One finalized side project is better than three abandoned ones.</p></blockquote><p>This is the premise of the article you are about to read. A finalized, working project can be placed on your resume, be showcased to other people, offer you more learning opportunities, and potentially become your income source in the future.</p><p>An abandoned project is a little bit of learning and a plus one to the number of your abandoned projects.</p><p>If you disagree with the above, then you can simply close this article and move on.</p><p>If you agree, here’s a related comic.</p><p><img src="https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Strip-Side-project-650-finalenglish.jpg#c" alt="Side Project Comic"></p><p>I think we’ve all been in those shoes and have our own skeletons in the closet.</p><p>I have been programming for over 11 years and have started many pet projects, but only a few of them saw the light of the day (or rather the eyes of the users).</p><p>Choosing a project idea is a task that depends on many factors like your level of experience, domain of activity, tech stack, your interests, your goals, etc., so do not expect to learn the best idea ever for your next project in this article.</p><p>What you can expect is to learn some generally applicable principles that will help you make a better choice.</p><h2 id="how-do-people-learn">How Do People Learn?</h2><p>Let’s briefly discuss about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/brain-basics/">how people learn</a> first. Whenever you read a book, watch a tutorial, or practice a skill, neurons in our brain fire together, forming complex neural circuits. It is these circuits that store the knowledge and skills we possess.</p><p>Moreover, our memory is associative, meaning that subsets of neural patterns are parts of many circuits. That explains how you can end up thinking about totally unrelated things to what you are currently doing. Some words might trigger a memory, which triggers another memory, and so on.</p><p>For instance, think of the last time you went to the seaside. Then think about what was the most memorable moment during that trip. Finally, think about something related to that unforgettable moment. This is how you hop around memories.</p><p>This also hints toward a more efficient approach toward learning new things: it is easier to “reuse” existing circuits rather than create new ones.</p><p>Consider these two explanations of what a computer program is:</p><blockquote><p>A computer program is a collection of instructions organized in functions, classes, modules, and libraries that perform a specific task.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A computer program consists of code that is grouped into entities called functions, classes, modules, and libraries. Like a lego, you can build a program to perform a specific task by combining various pieces together.</p></blockquote><p>The first is generic and very abstract, and it doesn’t consider any pre-existing knowledge in the listener’s mind. The second one makes an analogy and is easier to process since you can tap into your existing knowledge about what lego is and how it works.</p><p>Another crucial thing to learning is pre-requisite knowledge. You cannot build a roof without building the walls of a house. Although this sounds obvious, sometimes you might get too enthusiastic about a potential project, but because you don’t understand the fundamentals, you won’t be able to realize your idea.</p><h2 id="build-on-the-current-state-of-your-knowledge">Build On The Current State Of Your Knowledge</h2><p>Your next project should be based on some of your existing knowledge upon which you can learn new things. This might sound self-evident, but sometimes we simply skip the analysis phase and jump right into the development phase.</p><p>The amount of all knowledge required to build a project should overlap with your existing experience. Otherwise, learning will be inefficient.</p><p>You might want to take on a project that will teach you <strong>lots</strong> of new concepts, but bear in mind that creating new neural pathways takes time and energy. Keep in mind that there is no fast way to do that, so if you want to be efficient at it, you have to take the slow route.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-to-choose-project-venn-diagram.png" alt="Three types of projects as Venn diagrams"></p><p>There is a blurry line between efficient and inefficient projects from a learning standpoint:</p><ul><li>Choose a project that is too easy for you, and your learning will be minimal. Also, you might become bored along the way, not even finalizing it.</li><li>Choose a project that is too complex, and you will become frustrated and overwhelmed with the amount of information you need to learn and apply, which will increase the chances that you might as well abandon it.</li></ul><p>Finally, to shape up and structure the knowledge you already have, it helps to think about it through the prism of the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a>.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>The Pyramid of Mastery allows you to define a domain in terms of four layers: Elements (main concepts and building blocks), Rules (both how Elements operate and general Rules within the domain), Tools, and Frameworks.</p><p>With this in mind, let’s discuss some strategies that can help you choose your next pet project are.</p><h2 id="3-aspects-to-help-you-choose-your-next-side-project">3 Aspects To Help You Choose Your Next Side Project</h2><p>Below you can find general guidelines that will help you make the right decision regarding your next project.</p><h3 id="1-focus-on-a-single-layer-from-the-pyramid-of-mastery">1. Focus On A Single Layer From The Pyramid Of Mastery</h3><p>This is a guiding principle I follow whenever I choose to do a personal project: narrow down the scope of the type of knowledge you want to gain.</p><p>Do not mix up new Elements, Rules, Tools, and Frameworks together. Ideally, focus on a single layer and choose a project that will help you gain expertise in that specific area. If that is not possible, do not go more than two layers.</p><p>This is a common mistake that beginners make. They want to learn as much as possible from a single project. But quite often, those expectations are unrealistic. If you want to learn a framework, in a new programming language, using principles that you haven’t used before (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">asynchronous programming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">design patterns</a>, etc.), you are going to be overwhelmed with so much new information, that you won’t be able to process it and learn anything at all.</p><p>On many occasions, I made this mistake myself, and each time I had to review my project choice and start over with more realistic expectations and a narrower learning scope.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to start a project to learn new programming concepts, make it in the language you know best. If you’re going to build a project to learn a new programming language, do not throw in new Elements and Rules — focus on what you already know. Likewise, if you want to learn a new framework, make sure you are familiar with most of the Elements, Rules, and Tools it consists of.</p><p>This is also why it is not advisable to start learning programming with a Framework — you will get overwhelmed very fast by the vast amount of information on different Elements, programming Rules, programming language Rules, framework Rules, various Tools, etc. if you do not already know them.</p><h3 id="2-choose-a-project-of-an-appropriate-size">2. Choose A Project Of An Appropriate Size</h3><p>You might want to build the next Facebook, but sometimes you should focus on building a simple function or class first. This is a bit exaggerated, but as a general rule, your projects' scope should increase once you get more experience in your field.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery-swe/scale-of-impact.png#c" alt="Image with line chart"></p><p>Initially, focus on smaller projects with limited scope. When you start learning something, the amount of information you have to process is enormous. Since our <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">working memory</a> has a very limited capacity, keep the tasks small to not overwhelm it.</p><p>Once you have a solid foundation and understanding of the essential Elements and Rules, you can start working on slightly bigger projects. It is very similar to construction.</p><p>In construction, you cannot raise the walls of a brick house in a day. There is a certain recommended height to which you can grow the walls — around 4–5 feet<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Once you reach that, you have to let the cement solidify, as otherwise, the wall can tilt and collapse.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> the scope size is also a better indicator than years of experience of a software engineer’s seniority level. You can have 5 years of experience, but if you work on individual modules and do not participate in bigger architectural decisions, you are a mid-level developer.</p><h3 id="3-choose-something-that-will-motivate-you">3. Choose Something That Will Motivate You</h3><p>Another aspect of project selection is the motivation you have to build it. If you are working on something you are excited about, chances are higher that you will actually finalize it and learn from it.</p><p>Even small projects can be challenging and exciting to build — you just need to put some thought into what you would like to create, depending on what you would like to learn.</p><p>There are several approaches to it that I find helpful:</p><p><strong>1. Think about what actions you are repeatedly performing that you could automate.</strong> It can be a small thing, like <em>writing a function that would erase the contents of your computer’s Trash Bin and then automate it to execute once a week.</em></p><p><strong>2. Think about what would be useful to you once in a while.</strong> Even if there might be dozens of existing services out there that offer it. For instance, <em>write a command-line interface (cli) to which you are providing a path, and it doubles down the sizes of all the images it finds in that path, thus saving disk space.</em></p><p><strong>3. Think about what features you like in some products/services, and build them from scratch.</strong> Here, the options are countless. Just pick your favorite service and try to reproduce a small part of it.</p><p><strong>4. Think about a problem you have that you would like to resolve.</strong> This resonates with point 1 from above, but on a bigger scale. And this is also the entry point to the realm of entrepreneurs and doers. Many people have started their companies simply because they didn’t like the current state of the services and products they have used.</p><p>And then there’s always the option to google a list of project ideas and pick one, but you can do better than that.</p><p>Remember that the goal to follow when selecting a project is to learn something new while also improving your work/life/leisure/etc. This will keep fueling your motivation and help you go through it till the end.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Successful learning projects are much more than just an idea. However, a good idea is the first step that you need to have to build a project.</p><p>To wrap up this guide, here are the strategies to keep in mind when choosing your next project:</p><ol><li>Decide on what you want to learn.

<p>Images define the world, each image has its own story, it contains a lot of crucial information that can be useful in many ways. This information can be obtained with the help of the technique known as <strong>Image Processing</strong>.</p>



<p>It is the core part of computer vision which plays a crucial role in many real-world examples like robotics, self-driving cars, and object detection. Image processing allows us to transform and manipulate thousands of images at a time and extract useful insights from them. It has a wide range of applications in almost every field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Python is one of the widely used programming languages for this purpose. Its amazing libraries and tools help in achieving the task of image processing very efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this article, you will learn about classical algorithms, techniques, and tools to process the image and get the desired output.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it!</p>






<h2>What is image processing?</h2>



<p>As the name says, image processing means processing the image and this may include many different techniques until we reach our goal. </p>



<p>The final output can be either in the form of an image or a corresponding feature of that image. This can be used for further analysis and decision making.</p>



<p>But what is an image?</p>



<p>An image can be represented as a 2D function F(x,y) where x and y are spatial coordinates. The amplitude of F at a particular value of x,y is known as the intensity of an image at that point. If x,y, and the amplitude value is finite then we call it a digital image. It is an array of pixels arranged in columns and rows. Pixels are the elements of an image that contain information about intensity and color. An image can also be represented in 3D where x,y, and z become spatial coordinates. Pixels are arranged in the form of a matrix. This is known as an <strong>RGB image</strong>.</p>











<p>There are various types of images:</p>



<ul><li>RGB image: It contains three layers of 2D image, these layers are Red, Green, and Blue channels.</li><li>Grayscale image: These images contain shades of black and white and contain only a single channel.</li></ul>






<h2>Classic image processing algorithms</h2>



<h3><strong>1. Morphological Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>Morphological image processing tries to remove the imperfections from the binary images because binary regions produced by simple thresholding can be distorted by noise. It also helps in smoothing the image using opening and closing operations.</p>



<p>Morphological operations can be extended to grayscale images. It consists of non-linear operations related to the structure of features of an image. It depends on the related ordering of pixels but on their numerical values. This technique analyzes an image using a small template known as <strong>structuring element </strong>which is placed on different possible locations in the image and is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood pixels. A structuring element is a small matrix with 0 and 1 values.</p>



<p>Let’s see the two fundamental operations of morphological image processing, <strong>Dilation and Erosion:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>dilation </strong>operation<strong> </strong>adds pixels to the boundaries of the object in an image</li><li><strong>erosion </strong>operation<strong> </strong>removes the pixels from the object boundaries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The number of pixels removed or added to the original image depends on the size of the structuring element.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you may be thinking “what is a structuring element?” Let me explain:</p>



<p>Structuring element is a matrix consisting of only 0’s and 1’s that can have any arbitrary shape and size. It is positioned at all possible locations in the image and it is compared with the corresponding neighbourhood of pixels.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="688" height="255" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?resize=688%2C255&amp;ssl=1" alt="square structuring" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?w=688&amp;ssl=1 688w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/square-structuring.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>

<p>The square structuring element ‘A’ fits in the object we want to select,&nbsp;the ‘B’ intersects the object and ‘C’ is out of the object.</p>



<p>The zero-one pattern defines the configuration of the structuring element. It’s according to the shape of the object we want to select. The center of the structuring element identifies the pixel being processed.</p>

<h3><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Gaussian Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>Gaussian blur which is also known as gaussian smoothing, is the result of blurring an <strong>image</strong> by a <strong>Gaussian</strong> function.</p>



<p>It is <strong>used to reduce image noise and reduce details</strong>. The visual effect of this blurring technique is similar to looking at an image through the translucent screen. It is sometimes used in computer vision for image enhancement at different scales or as a data augmentation technique in deep learning.</p>



<p>The basic gaussian function looks like:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/srvKqGimVCCB88Tm08WEeNCWu1RNrmtgUQz_NNkbOXQYGFiTMpdP8CpLPniL61cWYmS5csT2eh4qRdVyw1T4qDaPGxQhQ5iMwdTzbNeZNwb9gZBoKL1siyPiCERj7dqkuupPYq8B" alt="" width="312" height="107"></figure></div>



<p>In practice, it is best to take advantage of the Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used to blur the image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass. Let’s see an example to understand what gaussian filters do to an image.</p>



<p>If we have a filter which is normally distributed, and when its applied to an image, the results look like this:</p>











<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AuwMJAqjJc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>You can see that some of the edges have little less detail. The filter is giving more weight to the pixels at the center than the pixels away from the center. Gaussian filters are low-pass filters i.e. weakens the high frequencies. It is commonly <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci373s1c/PatricesLectures/Gaussian%20Filtering_1up.pdf">used in edge detection</a>.</p>






<h3><strong>3. Fourier Transform in image processing</strong></h3>



<p>Fourier transform breaks down an image into sine and cosine components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has multiple applications like image reconstruction, image compression, or image filtering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since we are talking about images, we will take discrete fourier transform into consideration.</p>



<p>Let’s consider a sinusoid, it comprises of three things:</p>



<ul><li>Magnitude – related to contrast&nbsp;</li><li>Spatial frequency – related to brightness</li><li>Phase – related to color information</li></ul>



<p>The image in the frequency domain looks like this:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?resize=564%2C289&amp;ssl=1" alt="fourier" width="564" height="289" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1 752w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/fourier-transform.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oACegp4iGi0&amp;t=63s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>The formula for 2D discrete fourier transform is:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TQtrT4ZU5-blMNl7xNEnYLWL9n0t97YtTGX3Z-6FISq7mGw_zSMcFRxET7wH9UXN5vSHH_Rj5E6WBEiQAfKlDZYz0SovFhXbUtmVsp_w58AjLTVfpqtOLVAMC-99qrLU9XQocAB3" alt="" width="526" height="92"></figure></div>



<p>In the above formula, f(x,y) denotes the image.</p>



<p>The inverse fourier transform converts the transform back to image. The formula for 2D inverse discrete fourier transform is:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QMVgupeB_kBmnECIyIx5ILBCGNMkmuimyy3WpOIEzYvCQE0OsYCbjlPmIj7_elgleTPQ5oPrH2XghQwdUTFZxKSQQTjSFHCzysUvSqsn5ucDblcr7KgieYbwUS8tqNFQryZvhWHt" alt="" width="470" height="70"></figure></div>






<h3><strong>4. Edge Detection in image processing</strong></h3>



<p>Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness.</p>



<p>This could be very beneficial in extracting useful information from the image because most of the shape information is enclosed in the edges. Classic edge detection methods work by detecting discontinuities in the brightness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can rapidly react if some noise is detected in the image while detecting the variations of grey levels. Edges are defined as the local maxima of the gradient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most common edge detection algorithm is <strong>sobel edge detection algorithm</strong>. Sobel detection operator is made up of 3*3 convolutional kernels. A simple kernel Gx and a 90 degree rotated kernel Gy. Separate measurements are made by applying both the kernel separately to the image.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Wavelet Image Processing</strong></h3>



<p>We saw a Fourier transform but it is only limited to the frequency. Wavelets take both time and frequency into the consideration. This transform is apt for non-stationary signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that edges are one of the important parts of the image, while applying the traditional filters it’s been noticed that noise gets removed but image gets blurry. The wavelet transform is designed in such a way that we get good frequency resolution for low frequency components. Below is the 2D wavelet transform example:</p>

<h2>Image processing using Neural Networks</h2>



<p>Neural Networks are multi-layered networks consisting of neurons or nodes. These neurons are the core processing units of the neural network. They are designed to act like human brains. They take in data, train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the output.</p>



<p>A basic neural network has three layers:</p>



<ol><li>Input layer</li><li>Hidden layer</li><li>Output layer</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Basic-neural-network.png?resize=651%2C368&amp;ssl=1" alt="Basic-neural-network" width="651" height="368" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Basic-neural-network.png?w=868&amp;ssl=1 868w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Basic-neural-network.png?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Basic-neural-network.png?resize=768%2C434&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><em>Basic neural network | <a href="https://www.wandb.com/articles/fundamentals-of-neural-networks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>The input layers receive the input, the output layer predicts the output and the hidden layers do most of the calculations. The number of hidden layers can be modified according to the requirements. There should be atleast one hidden layer in a neural network.</p>



<p>The basic working of the neural network is as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Let’s consider an image, each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer, neurons of one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels.&nbsp;</li><li>Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as weight.&nbsp;</li><li>The inputs are multiplied by the corresponding weights and this weighted sum is then fed as input to the hidden layers.&nbsp;</li><li>The output from the hidden layers is passed through an activation function which will determine whether the particular neuron will be activated or not.&nbsp;</li><li>The activated neurons transmits data to the next hidden layers. In this manner, data is propagated through the network, this is known as Forward Propagation.&nbsp;</li><li>In the output layer, the neuron with the highest value predicts the output. These outputs are the probability values.</li><li>The predicted output is compared with the actual output to obtain the error. This information is then transferred back through the network, the process is known as Backpropagation.</li><li>Based on this information, the weights are adjusted. This cycle of forward and backward propagation is done several times on multiple inputs until the network predicts the output correctly in most of the cases.</li><li>This ends the training process of the neural network. The time taken to train the neural network may get high in some cases.</li></ol>

  A very important aspect of security lies in reducing the attack surface something that you'd like to keep safe. While
  I love Node.js, the ecosystem has given rise to thousands of modules each of which increases the chances of malicious
  code sneaking in. Examples of such code include (but are not limited to) stealing your private SSH keys, browser
  password files, environment variables and much more. In this article, we will look a how we can build a secure Node.js
  development environment via docker containers.
</p>

<p>
  Let us a pick a very basic web application that requires a database and see how we can dockerize it. Let us first
  start with the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> which resides in our project root and contains the top-level
  configuration for our containers:
</p>

<pre>version: "3.3"
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # So you don't have to use root, but you can if you like
      MYSQL_USER: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # You can use whatever password you like
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: "dockerize-it-sample"
      # Password for root access
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "dockerize-it-sample"
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    expose:
      - "3306"
    networks:
      - dockerize-it-sample-network
    volumes:
      - dockerize-it-sample-db:/var/lib/mysql
      
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: dockerize-it-sample
    container_name: dockerize-it-sample
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=3306
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - dockerize-it-sample-network
    volumes:
      - .:/home/node/app
      - node_modules:/home/node/app/node_modules
      - /home/node/app/.git
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: npm run start

networks:
  dockerize-it-sample-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  dockerize-it-sample-db:
  node_modules:
</pre>

<p>
  So we're using docker-compose (1.25.0) with docker (19.03.12) to spin up 2 containers, one of them being a database
  with the second one being our application container.
</p>

<h5>Api container</h5>

<p>
  The app container depends on the database and essentially copies all the contents of the project directory into the
  container but hides the dreaded <code>node_modules</code> folder. Moreover, we also hide the version control folder,
  <code>.git</code>. We pass the hostname for the database via an environment variable and setup both containers on the
  same network. Assuming that this is some sort of a web application running on port 8080, we expose it so that we can
  access the running application via the <code>localhost</code>. Finally, we tell the container to execute
  <code>npm run start</code> when it starts. Let us now look at the <code>Dockerfile</code> which defines how the api
  container is created:
</p>

<pre>FROM node:12-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache git

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules &amp;&amp; chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./

USER node

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .
</pre>

<p>
  Creating the api container is fairly straightforward, we use a standard Node.js docker image and then install git in
  case we need to install from a non-npm repository. We thereafter create a local <code>app</code> folder under the
  <code>node</code> user and copy the <code>package.json</code> and the <code>package-lock.json</code> files into it. We
  then install the dependencies locally within the container. Finally we make sure that the local user owns all the
  files. As an added level of precaution we can also ignore certain items from getting copied into the container via a
  <code>.dockerignore</code> file:
</p>

<pre>node_modules
npm-debug.log

Dockerfile*
docker-compose*
.dockerignore

.git*

data-*/
.vscode/
</pre>

<p>
  Predictably, this file functions as a <code>.gitignore</code> file and we skip copying over
  <code>node_modules</code> (just in case we might have have installed something locally as well). Note that since we
  will be mounting the current directory into the app container anything that is not specifically excluded by creating
  an overlay mount point will be exposed to the application!
</p>

<h5>Database container</h5>

<p>
  Coming back the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, the database container uses a standard MySQL image and the only
  special thing about it is that we expose the MySQL port (3306) so that we can connect to the database from our local
  machine. We also set up a named volume (<code>dockerize-it-sample-db</code>) so that our data is persisted across
  container restarts.
</p>

<h5>Running the containers</h5>

<p>
  Executing <code>docker-compose build</code> should build all containers and we can always run
  <code>docker-compose build --no-cache</code> to force building all the containers from scratch. Note that this can
  lead to a lot of intermediate containers lying about and these can likely be cleaned via a
  <code>docker system prune</code> command. Running <code>docker-compose up</code> will fire up both containers and we
  should be able to make code changes locally.
</p>

<h5>Why do this?</h5>

<p>
  So now that we have dockerized everything, how does it actually help? The idea behind this exercise was that the
  application dependencies should be installed in a barebones container that does not provide any access to the local
  development environment. Moreover, the actual code is on the local machine and one can use their preferred method of
  development with only the execution of the code being outsourced to the container. A normal workflow such as
  hot-reloading code, etc. should all work out of the box. If you'd like to run tests that require an execution
  environment you can jump into the container itself and run commands directly:
  <code>docker exec -it dockerize-it-sample /bin/sh</code>.
</p>

<h5>Gotchas</h5>

<p>
  Note that I've had some issues with typescript development where I've needed to install type definitions locally. This
  can be achieved via:
  <code>npm i --no-package-lock --no-save @types/supertest @types/request @types/mocha @types/chai --ignore-scripts</code>. Note that the lockfile needs to be ignored as npm installs all dependencies if it sees one. Also, we ignore all
  scripts for security which was the point of this exercise.
</p>

<p>
  Another gotcha is the installation of dependencies from private git repositories. These depend on your private SSH key
  and there is unfortunately no easy way to pass sensitive information to non-swarm docker containers (i.e. single node
  local installation). The best that I could come up with was to create a new private key and add it as a deploy key to
  the private repository. This key is then copied over to the container while building and deleted after the the modules
  have been installed. Sample <code>Dockerfile</code>:
</p>

<pre>FROM node:12-alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache git openssh-client

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules &amp;&amp; chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./
COPY --chown=node:node ./docker/private-repo.key ./private-repo.key

USER node

RUN mkdir ~/.ssh 

# only for swarm
# RUN ln -s /run/secrets/host_ssh_key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# RUN cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

RUN ssh-keyscan -t rsa private-repo.url &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN cp ./private-repo.key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

RUN rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
RUN rm ./private-repo.key
</pre>

<p>
  As can be noted above, for docker swarm installations one can use the secrets feature which mounts secrets in a
  special volume. While this is not secure as the post install scripts might be able to slurp the contents of
  <code>~/.ssh</code>, we do limit the damage by providing a read-only key.
</p>

  A practical example can be found here:
  <a href="https://github.com/smalldatatech/dockerize-it-sample">https://github.com/smalldatatech/dockerize-it-sample</a>. This is a web application that runs on 8080 and returns a directory listing of the running user's home directory.
  You can try it out and as always, I am very happy for your feedback.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who doesn’t love a good stack teardown? Ever since I saw <a href="https://cushionapp.com/running-costs/">Cushion’s running costs</a> page, I’ve been low key addicted to reading about how other apps are built.</p>
<p>I work on an app called <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> that helps musicians and podcasters make videos for social media. So in the spirit of the teardown, here are the tools and services I use to run it!</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list — I’ve omitted some obvious ones (like HTML) and ones that are implied by other tooling choices (like HCL for Terraform).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> — A superset of JavaScript with static types. I fell in love with this language when I first tried it a few years ago, and it’s only gotten better since then. I use it for both the frontend and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> — A superset of CSS with cool features like mixins and nesting. I use it for both the marketing site and — with <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a> — the web app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-systems-and-frameworks">Build Systems and Frameworks</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> — The frontend is a single-page app built with React, which has been a great choice — it gets out of the way and lets me just work on the app. There might be other frameworks out there that are quote unquote better, but the sheer size of the React community means I basically never run into any uncharted territory.</li>
<li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> — A batteries-included build system for React. The first time I made a React app, I cobbled together the configuration for Webpack/Babel/etc myself. Create React App hides all that — with the option to “eject” and get the full configuration if I ever need to do something it doesn’t support.</li>
<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> — A Node.js server-side framework. Just like with React, I chose it because it’s the most popular by far. As for why I chose Node.js rather than another language, it’s because I need to run the same video rendering code in the browser and on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> — A fast static site generator written, used to build the marketing site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>This list is also not exhaustive, but there are too many libraries to name them all here, so I’ve tried to keep it to the most notable or interesting ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction">immer</a> — An intuitive, performant way to do immutability. It can also serialize patches you make to an object, so it’s fairly easy to implement undo functionality as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.downshift-js.com/">downshift</a> — A React library for building accessible dropdowns and multi-selects. Easy to style, and you get accessibility for free.</li>
<li><a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper</a> — A nifty little tooltip positioning library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> — Node library for using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas API</a> on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> — Swiss army knife audio and video library. I use this to on the server convert audio files to WAV and to combine individual frames into users' videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> — Domain name registrar. Don’t get turned off by the slightly sketchy name — they’re my favorite registrar that I’ve used.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> — Provides DNS, SSL termination and DDOS protection for the websites and API.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> — Hosts static files for the app frontend and marketing site. It’s really easy to use and there’s a generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> — Cloud infrastructure provider, but with plain Linux servers rather than proprietary services. I use them for servers, databases, and object storage to host users' file uploads and videos. Their web UI and API are both really easy to use; I never want to go back to AWS. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e506b6f94e20">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> — Transactional email provider. I switched from <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> when I exceeded their free tier and couldn’t get in touch with support, and boy am I glad I did. Postmark’s delivery rate is better, and the dashboard is faster and easier to use. If you’re a bootstrapped startup, they’ll give you a <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/for/bootstrapped-startups">$75 credit</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> — Relational database for persisting the app’s data. I briefly considered <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well, but PostgreSQL has a bunch of really nice features like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html">returning data from modified rows</a>. I did not consider non-relational databases like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> — Key/value store, only used for a task queue. Usually I would put this part off and just build a monolith, but CPU-intensive video rendering needs its own server.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> — Time-series database for storing metrics. See the section on <a href="#monitoring">monitoring</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="servers">Servers</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> — The Linux distribution that the servers run. Like other parts of the stack, I chose it because it’s one of the most popular.</li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> — A web server and reverse proxy, used here as a load balancer for the API servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a> — A daemon that manages the processes&nbsp;on the server, like Node.js and nginx. <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">pm2</a> is another popular one, but it’s Node-specific.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>
<p>I’ve previously written about how I deploy SongRender, so you can <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/bluegreen-deploys-and-immutable-infrastructure-with-terraform/">read about it in more depth</a> if you’re interested. If you just want the high level, these are the tools involved.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> — An “infrastructure as code” tool, where you describe the infrastructure you want and it diffs with the infrastructure that actually exists. Kind of like React, but for configuration management. I love Terraform, and I use it to manage any infrastructure it supports.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> — A tool for building machine images. This makes it easy to deploy servers with Terraform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sentry.io/organizations/songrender/issues/">Sentry</a> — Error tracking. Picks up any uncaught exceptions in the client- and server-side code.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">Statuscake</a> — Uptime monitoring, making sure the website and API don’t go down. Chosen for its generous free tier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.papertrail.com/">Papertrail</a> — Log management. It forwards system log messages using <code>rsyslog</code>, so I can just use <code>console.log</code> in my server-side code and have it picked up. At some point I might try to switch to a service that supports structured logs, like <a href="https://timber.io/">Timber</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">Telegraf</a> — Agent that collects metrics from the servers and forwards them to InfluxDB. It makes it very easy to get metrics on CPU/memory/etc without paying an arm and a leg for something like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> — Metrics dashboard that displays data from InfluxDB and PostgreSQL. It’s easy to set up and use, and its visualizations are pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analytics">Analytics</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indicative.com/">Indicative</a> — App analytics. I was using <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, but I ended up exceeding their free tier — which was a shame, because I liked them a lot more. Might check out <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> when I have time.</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> — Website visitor stats for the marketing page and app. It’s simpler than Google Analytics and only $15 per month for small sites. <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/WBX5G9">💰 Affiliate link</a></li>
<li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search console</a> — Analytics about Google searches for which SongRender has shown up in the results.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> — Credit card processing and subscriptions. I <strong>love</strong> using Stripe. Their APIs are so well thought-out, the developer tooling is great and their documentation and dashboard are beautiful and easy to use. Their support is also responsive and helpful. I had such a positive experience with them that I registered SongRender LLC with Stripe Atlas, even though it cost a bit more than doing it manually.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> — Additional payment option. As happy as I am with Stripe, I’m that unhappy with PayPal: their tooling is lackluster, their documentation is not comprehensive and their website is slow. It’s also clearly not meant as a payment option for in-app purchases — for example, if you’re a new merchant, they’ll hold payments for a few weeks unless you upload a shipping label, which I obviously can’t do. People seem to like having it as a payment option, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a> — My business bank. One of the three options Stripe recommended as part of Atlas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p><span>Maybe it came via email, or a direct message on social media. But the message is always the same: “I’ve found a great opportunity to make money, and I can get you in, too.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now, in the social media age, most of us know that </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/10-million-women-pitched-by-mlms/"><span>being approached with a message like that</span></a><span> usually means that someone wants us to join their multi level marketing scheme, or MLM. But what many people </span><i><span>don’t</span></i><span> know is that the message could mean something more sinister: That you’re being recruited for an illegal pyramid scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>Many people refer to MLMs as pyramid schemes, and there’s a lot of confusion online about the difference between the two. So how do you know if that friend or family member is approaching you with a legitimate business opportunity, an outright scam, or something that lives in the gray area in between those two options?</span></p>
<p><span>As with most topics related to consumers protecting their best interests (and their money), your first line of defense is education. Ready to learn all about how to recognize a pyramid scheme or MLM, and what to do when you encounter them? Read on.</span></p>

It’s no wonder —&nbsp;they have a lot of traits in common.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Federal Trade Commission, a </span><b>pyramid scheme</b><span> is a scam that can look a lot like a legitimate business opportunity or an MLM, but the main difference is that pyramid schemes are set up to keep a constant flow of new recruits (and their money) coming into the business. Because of this, participants will often be heavily encouraged to recruit others (often their friends or family) to join.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a common misconception that if you’re asked to buy or sell a product, it’s not a pyramid scheme, but that isn’t true —&nbsp;pyramid scheme members are often asked to pay fees or consistently buy small amounts of product to keep their standing in the scheme, even if they still have a large amount of inventory they’ve been unable to sell.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><b>multi level marketing scheme</b><span>, on the other hand, is not illegal. MLM companies sell products or services, and </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/the-mlm-epidemic-in-13-jaw-dropping-maps-2019-11-8/"><span>recruit salespeople</span></a><span> to market and sell them directly to their friends, families, and networks. MLM participants are usually referred to as “distributors,” “participants,” or “contractors,” and they are </span><b>not</b><span> employed by the MLM company —&nbsp;they work as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span>Participants in MLMs often also struggle to sell enough products to clear their inventory or reach sales goals that will earn them advertised rewards. But according to the FTC, what sets an MLM apart from a pyramid scheme is that, in an MLM, the company will pay its participants </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> for selling products, and while recruiting new members might help them earn more money, it’s not a requirement for membership.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll go into more detail below about how to recognize a pyramid scheme or MLM, what red flags to look out for, and how to protect yourself from scams and bad business opportunities.</span></p>

Luckily, the FTC provides a list on its website of possible warning signs.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters make extravagant promises about how much money you can earn</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Whether it’s a pyramid scheme or MLM, your earning potential can be limited by many factors outside of your control, and anyone promising you’ll earn a certain amount is not being truthful.</span></p>
<p><b>If promoters use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to join</b><span>, it might be a pyramid scheme. Often, they’ll play on your emotions (“You’d be a bad dad if you didn’t take advantage of this opportunity to support your family”) or create a false sense of urgency (“This deal will be off the table if you don’t join today”). These kinds of tactics are employed to get people to join without taking the time to research the company. A legitimate business opportunity won’t require you to make any hasty decisions.</span></p>
<p><b>If participants buy more products than they can use or sell, </b><span>it might be a pyramid scheme. Participants will be required to buy a certain amount to stay “active” in the organization, and so even if they already have an excess of inventory, they’ll be forced to buy more. If you see this happening, it’s a major red flag.</span></p>
<h3><span>What To Do If You Encounter a Pyramid Scheme</span></h3>
<p><span>If you ever encounter what you suspect to be a pyramid scheme (even if you aren’t 100 percent sure), you can report it to the FTC so they can investigate.</span></p>
<p><span>FTC reports can be made online at </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#crnt&amp;panel1-1"><span>ftccomplaintassistant.gov</span></a><span>. Click “Education, Jobs, and Making Money,” and then select the option to submit a report about “Multi Level Marketing or Pyramid Schemes.” You’ll be taken to a series of forms where you can include all the details you know, so the FTC can decide whether it needs to launch a formal investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that the FTC won’t help you resolve an individual dispute, so if you’re looking to get money back after being recruited into a pyramid scheme, this avenue might not help you. But you have options for that, which we’ll explore more below.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Recognize Multi Level Marketing (MLM)</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference that distinguishes multi level marketing (also called MLM or direct sales) is that members of an MLM won’t be strictly </span><i><span>required</span></i><span> to recruit new members in order to get paid. They should be paid for selling the company’s products or services, regardless of whether or not they recruit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How MLM Participants Make Money</span></h3>
<p><span>Often, MLMs are set up so participants receive a commission from the products they sell themselves, and then, often a smaller commission from the products sold by participants they’ve recruited (called their downline).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this makes it possible to earn money only from the commissions from your own product sales, making a significant amount of money would require selling massive amounts of products, and most people just don’t have customer networks that can support that. And so, in some of these companies, the only way to make significant amounts of money is to recruit many, many people and collect commissions on their sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though MLMs aren’t illegal, the FTC </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0065-multi-level-marketing-businesses-and-pyramid-schemes"><span>warns on its website</span></a><span> that </span><b>most of the people who join them make very little money</b><span>, and some even lose money. MLMs are structured so that only a small number of people who join the organization early on can typically recruit enough participants to reach high levels of income and rewards.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/5bpek0/within_15_cycles_you_run_out_of_people_the_math/"><span>where a Reddit user did the math</span></a><span>: Because of the way MLMs are structured, there simply aren’t enough people on earth to support enough recruitment for people outside of the top 2 or 3 levels to reach the highest status, income, and rewards offered by MLM companies. As that Reddit user’s spreadsheet shows, if each member recruited only five new members, within 15 cycles, they’d surpass the entire population of the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you’re lucky enough to be one of the first few sellers/recruiters to join an MLM, you might amass enough of a downline to earn a good living. Any later than that, and it may be actually impossible for you to recruit enough to make a significant income.</span></p>
<h3><span>Are MLMs Illegal?</span></h3>
<p><span>According to the FTC, truly legitimate MLMs are not scams or pyramid schemes, and are not illegal.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the FTC has </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/11/ftc-alleges-neora-formerly-known-nerium-operates-illegal"><span>filed numerous lawsuits</span></a><span>, including several </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2019/10/ftc-settlement-ends-advocares-alleged-pyramid-scheme-bans"><span>in the last few years</span></a><span>, against MLM companies that it says crossed the line and operated as pyramid schemes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This highlights an important lesson for anyone considering joining an MLM: </span><b>Just because an MLM company has been operating for a long time or seems legitimate, doesn’t mean it’s not a pyramid scheme</b><span>. It’s important to carefully research these companies before joining them, and to temper any expectations you might have about quick success or extravagant earnings.</span></p>
<p><span>That isn’t to say that MLMs are bad for </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> people. Some early joiners do make a lot of money. And some people join just to buy products they love at a discount, or to sell small amounts of product for a side income. MLMs should be approached with caution, and before joining one, you have to be OK with the possibility that you could lose money, or make very little.</span></p>
<h2><span>Have You Fallen Victim to a Pyramid Scheme or a Scammy MLM?</span></h2>
<p><span>If you encounter a pyramid scheme, you should </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/reports"><span>report it to the FTC</span></a><span> right away. And if you encounter an MLM that’s using shady sales tactics or misleading its members, you should report that, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But what about you? If you’ve lost money, or you’re looking for justice after a bad experience with these kinds of schemes, what legal options do you have?</span></p>

November 16, 2020 | http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2020/cacert/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://current.workingdirectory.net/posts/2020/cacert/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">







<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content" role="main">
<p>There are many blogs and tutorials with nice shortcuts providing the necessary
<code>openssl</code> commands to create and sign x509 certficates.</p>

<p>However, there is precious few instructions for how to easily create your own
certificate authority.</p>

<p>You probably never want to do this in a production environment, but in a
development environment it will make your life signficantly easier.</p>

<h2>Create the certificate authority</h2>

<h3>Create the key and certificate</h3>

<p>Pick a directory to store things in. Then, make your certificate authority key and certificate:</p>

<pre><code>openssl genrsa -out cakey.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key cakey.pem -sha256 -days 1024 -out cacert.pem
</code></pre>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be prompted to enter some information about your certificate
authoirty. Provide the minimum information - i.e., only overwrite the
defaults. So, provide a value for <code>Country</code>, <code>State or Province</code>, and
<code>Organization Name</code> and leave the rest blank.</li>
<li>You probably want to leave the password blank if this is a
development/testing environment.</li>
</ul>


<p>Want to review what you created?</p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -text -noout -in cacert.pem 
</code></pre>

<h3>Prepare your directory</h3>

<p>You can create your own <code>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</code> file and really customize things. But I
find it safer to use your distribution's default file so you can benefit from
changes to it every time you upgrade.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> take the default file, you may have the <code>dir</code> option coded to
<code>demoCA</code> (in Debian at least, maybe it's the upstream default too).</p>

<p>So, to avoid changing any configuration files, let's just use this value. Which
means... you'll need to create that directory. The setting is relative - so you
can create this directory in the same directory you have your keys.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir demoCA
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, you have to have a file that keeps track of your certificates. If it
doesn't exist, you get an error:</p>

<pre><code>touch demoCA/index.txt
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Your certificate authority is ready to go.</p>

<h2>Create a key and ceritificate signing request</h2>

<p>First, pick your domain names (aka "common" names). For example, <code>example.org</code>
and <code>www.example.org</code>.</p>

<p>Set those values in an environment variable. If you just have one:</p>

<pre><code>export subjectAltName=DNS:example.org
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more then one:</p>

<pre><code>export subjectAltName=DNS:example.org,DNS:www.example.org
</code></pre>

<p>Next, create a key and a certificate signing request:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -new -nodes -out new.csr -keyout new.key
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you will be prompted for some values (country, state, etc) - be sure to
choose the same values you used with your certficiate authority! I honestly
don't understand why this is necessary (when I set different values I get an
error on the signing request step below). Maybe someone can add a comment to
this post explaining why these values have to match?</p>

<p>Also, you must provide a common name for your certificate - you can choose the
same name as the altSubjectNames value you set above (but just one domain).</p>

<p>Want to review what you created?</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -in new.csr -text -noout 
</code></pre>

<h2>Sign it!</h2>

<p>At last the momenet we have been waiting for.</p>

<pre><code>openssl ca -keyfile cakey.pem -cert cacert.pem -out new.crt -outdir . -rand_serial -infiles new.csr
</code></pre>

<p>Now yu have a new.crt and new.csr that you can install via your web browser,
mail server, etc specification.</p>

<h2>Sanity check it</h2>

<p>This command will confirm that the certificate is trusted by your certificate
authority.</p>

<pre><code>openssl verify -no-CApath -CAfile cacert.pem new.crt 
</code></pre>

<h2>But wait, there's still a question of trust</h2>

<p>You probably want to tell your computer or browser that you want to trust your
certificate signing authority.</p>

<h3>Command line tools</h3>

<p>Most tools in linux by default will trust all the certificates in
<code>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</code>. (If that file doesn't exist, try
installing the <code>ca-certificates</code> package). If you want to add your certificate
to that file:</p>

<pre><code>cp cacert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cacert.crt
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates
</code></pre>

<p>Want to know what's funny? Ok, not really funny. If the certificate name ends
with <code>.pem</code> the command above won't work. Seriously.</p>

<p>Once your certificate is installed with your web server you can now test to
make sure it's all working with:</p>

<pre><code>gnutls-cli --print-cert $domainName
</code></pre>

<p>Want a second opinion?</p>

<pre><code>curl https://$domainName
wget https://$domainName -O-
</code></pre>

<p>Both will report errors if the certificate can't be verified by a system
certificate.</p>

<p>If you really want to narrow down the cause of error (maybe reconfiguring
ca-certificates didn't work)?</p>

<pre><code>curl --cacert /path/to/your/cacert.pem --capath /tmp
</code></pre>

<p>Those arguments tell curl to use your certificate authority file and not to
load any other certificate authority files (well, unless you have some
installed in the temp directory).</p>

<h3>Web browsers</h3>

<p>Firefox and Chrome have their own store of trusted certificates - you'll have
to import your cacert.pem file into each browser that you want to trust your
key.</p>

<![CDATA[Writing an embedded display driver in Rust]]>

November 16, 2020 | https://nitschinger.at/Writing-an-embedded-display-driver-in-Rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nitschinger.at/Writing-an-embedded-display-driver-in-Rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A year or so ago when I started my yourney into embedded development (to build a PID controller for my coffee machine) I bought a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_RGB_OLED_Module">1.5 inch RGB OLED display</a>, which uses a SSD1351 controller. I got lucky, because a display driver for it <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ssd1351">already existed</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very recently it stopped working and I’m not sure why. Okay, maybe I tightened those screws a bit too much. Anyways, since I did not need a color display, I bought a very similar <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">1.5 inch OLED display</a>. After plugging it in and not seeing anything rendered on the screen (and not touching my screwdriver), I realized that it uses a different controller: the SSD1327. This time I wasn’t as lucky, because there happened to be no embedded rust driver out there yet.</p>
<p>When life gives you lemons, write a display driver for them - and then blog about it so everyone gets to learn maybe a thing or two.</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/display-clean.jpg" alt="Display with Text"></p>
<p>The basic driver we are going to implement in this post works, but is neither flexible nor configurable. The full driver (which is still evolving) is goint to be a bit more complex and can be found <a href="https://github.com/daschl/ssd1327">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, we first need to figure out how to talk to the display and what protocol to use. The <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/a/ac/SSD1327-datasheet.pdf">Datasheet</a> is very handy and I recommend to keep it open in a separate tab while working on the code.</p>
<p>The controller supports different modes of communication: 4-wire SPI, 3-wire SPI, I2C, Parallel 6800 and Parallel 8080. In this blog post we’ll use 4-wire SPI which is the one the display comes preconfigured with. The bytes we send over SPI can either be commands (for example to turn the display on or off) or actual pixel data to render on the screen. The datasheet thankfully has all that info, but it can be a little tough to digest at first if you need to start from zero.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don’t need to start from zero. There are two very useful codebases out there which will help us hit the ground running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the demo code from the <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module">Waveshare Website</a>, which contains C code we can look at, which is very helpful especially to understand what commands we need to send during startup.</li>
<li>A controller driver for the very similar <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306">ssd1306</a> exists, and it is very well written. We can borrow some concepts like the command structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could directly talk to our hardware SPI interface, but that is not going to be very portable. Ideally we want to plug this display driver into the established embedded rust ecosystem and benefit from code reuse and portability. For our purpose, three crates are important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/therealprof/display-interface">display-interface</a>: traits that bridge between a bus driver (i.e. SPI) and a display driver (our ssd1327). By using this crate, we also open the door to support I2C later.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics">embedded-graphics</a>: once we can talk to the device, we also need to render pixels. This crate will make it super easy to render text, lines and more.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal">embedded-hal</a>: this is the main hardware abstraction layer crate and we’ll use it to talk to specific hardware pins and use time delay functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to make use of all three in the next sections.</p>

<p>Before we can render pixels on the screen, we need to initialize our display. The datasheet contains <em>a lot</em> of different commands, many of them are hardware oriented and it is pretty hard to figure out what we need. Thankfully, if we peek into the waveshare sample code, we can see a function like this:</p>

  <span>//Turn on the OLED display
</span><span></span>  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xAF</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>This gives us a first idea: we need to reset the display, then initialize it, sleep and then write <code>0xAF</code>. Searching for <code>AF</code> in the datasheet tells us that this command will turn the display on. Alright, let’s start with reset:</p>

  Driver_Delay_ms(<span>100</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The code sets the RST (“reset”) pin from our display to high, then low and then high again, sleeping 100ms in between. So how would we translate that to rust?</p>

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>The <code>embedded-hal</code> crate defines two important traits: one for an <code>OutputPin</code> and one to <code>Delay</code> for a certain number of milliseconds. The actual implementation comes from your board HAL (hardware abstraction layer), one of which we’ll see later. Also note that error handling is omitted here to simplify the code for this blog post.</p>
<p>Next up, we need to initialize the display. The C code is not very well documented, but we can see that a sequence of commands is sent to the display:</p>

</span><span></span>
  <span>***</span> many more commands here <span>***</span>

  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0xfd</span>);
  OLED_WriteReg(<span>0x12</span>);

}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For our rust code we want to turn those commands into an actual <code>enum</code> so it is easier to understand. We also need to implement the equivalent of <code>OLED_WriteReg</code>, which will send those commands to the display. This is where the <code>display-interface</code> crate comes in. The <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait it defines abstracts the actual low level communication for us and we just need to call the implementation of the trait.</p>
<p>The idea of the following code is shamelessly taken from the excellent <code>ssd1306</code> crate. Every command gets its own enum variant and we can <code>send</code> it to our display:</p>

    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>For the actual driver we need more commands, but the approach is always the same. On <code>send</code> we match on the enum variant and turn it into a byte slice which is then sent over the connection through the <code>WriteOnlyDataCommand</code> trait.</p>
<p><em>If you wonder why it specifies the length and data in such a weird way (as I did): if you try to return the array in the match arms rust will complain that the match arms have different array sizes. So the workaround by <a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles">jamwaffles</a> is to always return a byte array with the same length, but then pass a slice of the correct size to the display. This makes the compiler happy and keeps the implementation short.</em></p>
<p>Before we can glue it all together, we need to figure out how we can send the pixel information to the display.</p>

<p>Our display has 128 rows and 128 colums with a potential of 16 colors each. 16 colors are represented by 4 bits, which is why the internal graphic display data RAM (GDDRAM) contains a buffer of <code>128 * 128 * 4 = 65536</code> bits. This allows to store all information for our 16384 pixels. Since rust does not have a <code>u4</code> datatype, we’ll use a single byte <code>u8</code> representation instead. This allows us to store the information of two pixels in one byte, so we need a buffer size of <code>65536 / 8 = 8192</code> bytes.</p>
<p>This is where <code>embedded-graphics</code> comes in. It defines a <code>DrawTarget</code> trait which we need to implement for our display. All we need to tell it is how to draw a pixel and what our display size is, and it will figure out the rest for us (i.e. drawing text or a shape):</p>

Since this trait supports all kinds of displays, we need to tell it which pixel colors we support. <code>Gray4</code> indicates 4 bit grayscale, so exactly what we need.

<p>In the <code>draw_pixel</code> method, we extract the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the pixel as well as its color through the <code>luma()</code> method. We first need to calculate the actual absolute position in our buffer based on the coordinates and then set the color on the element. Since we store 2 colors per byte the code needs to perform some bitshifting and either set the high or low 4 bits of the byte. This code has been taken from the waveshare C code and ported over to rust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>These are rough thoughts, a working out of my position and why I believe what I believe. I am just a part-time wikipedia philosopher (though I would like to dedicate more time to studying this seriously) and there may be flaws in how I’m approaching this problem. However, I intent to continue updating this post over time as I continue to learn. I am a Christian, and the position I hold and <em>my</em> individual answer to the ‘Absurd’ reflects this.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/07/camus-myth-of-sisyphus-suicide/">Albert Camus</a>, I believe that the ultimate question that every person needs to be answer for themself is ‘judging whether life is or is not worth living’. The Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">Absurdism</a> has an interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism#Relationship_to_existentialism_and_nihilism">table</a> that compares various reactions to the question of the Absurd (defined as “the fundamental disharmony between the individual’s search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe”). It is easy to be carried away by the busy-ness of modern life and ignore this question, because it makes us uncomfortable - but every individual must face up to it and answer it for themselves if they intend to live life intentionally.</p><p>If one assumes that no objective meaning (or inherent meaning in the universe) exists, then for an individual, death can be considered equivalent to the end of the universe. This is because in such a situation, the only reality an individual knows is his or her own, and the only possible meaning he/she can ascribe is completely subjective - which ceases to exist at their death. Death is the same as the extinguishing of the universe.</p><p>Let’s consider the four reactions to the ‘Absurd’ that the wikipedia entry lays out, and we’ll work through them in reverse order.</p><h2 id="nihilism">Nihilism</h2><p>In the absence of objective meaning or value, I believe Nihilism is a completely logical (and only) position to take. However, the working out of Nihilism results in the conclusion that death (and the permanent end to individual suffering) is far more preferable to the continuation of the individual’s life in the hope of ephemeral pleasure or transient individual meaning. The smallest amount of suffering far outweights the largest pleasure - since the suffering has no ultimate meaning and is pointless.</p><h2 id="absurdism">Absurdism</h2><p>This position seems logical, and it appears to accept the lack of objective meaning. But I disagree with the idea that there is purpose in the continuation of an individual’s life. There is no point in finding joy and meaning in one’s own life, if that implies meaningless suffering and the extinguishing of all purpose and meaning at death. One might as well, avoid the hassle and resolve everything with death immediately.</p><h2 id="atheistic-existentialism">Atheistic Existentialism</h2><p>This position makes no sense to me. The pursuit of meaning cannot have meaning in itself. Death resolves everything, any meaning derived this way is degated at death. If no objective meaning exists, then the death of an individual is the same as the end of the universe - which makes all grand humanist schemes meaningless. If one were to derive their life’s meaning from contributing to the prosperity of the human race, the end of the universe makes this pointless (and the death of an individual is equivalent to the end of the universe for that individual).</p><h2 id="monotheistic-existentialism">Monotheistic Existentialism</h2><p>In my opinion, this is the only logical position to take that makes life worth living. This is really a rejection of the ‘Absurd’. There is no absurd, because there <em>is</em> objective meaning inherent meaning in the universe. There is meaning beyond an individual’s life, and there does exist a “grand scheme of things” that individual’s can impact.</p></div></div>]]>

November 16, 2020 | https://sylormiller.com/posts/2020/core-web-vitals/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sylormiller.com/posts/2020/core-web-vitals/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  <div>
    <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience.html">Google announced</a> that they will officially start using a subset of web performance metrics known as Core Web Vitals as part of their search ranking calculations starting in May 2021. This is huge, positive news in the perf &amp; SEO worlds. Google's inclusion of Core Web Vitals will act as a much-needed forcing function to encourage sites to improve their performance.</p>
<p>However, my excitement for Core Web Vitals is tempered with a healthy skepticism. I'm not yet convinced that Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are the right metrics that all sites should be measuring themselves against. I worry that the outsized emphasis placed on Core Web Vitals by including them in SEO scoring will result in developers focusing solely on those three numbers without truly understanding what they mean and, more importantly, what they <em>don't</em> mean.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-web-perf-metrics">A brief history of web perf metrics <a href="#a-brief-history-of-web-perf-metrics">#</a></h2>
<p>In order to understand the importance of Core Web Vitals, it's helpful to understand the historical context of web performance metrics and how we got to this point. For many years, the only way that we were able to track and measure performance on the web was via a set of network- and browser internals-based metrics known collectively as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API">Navigation Timing</a>. The Navigation Timing spec is widely supported across browsers (even going back to IE9!). These metrics answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>When does the server respond to a request with the first byte of HTML (time to first byte/TTFB)?</li>
<li>When does the browser finish loading and parsing the DOM (DOM content loaded/DCL)?</li>
<li>When have all the assets included on the page finished downloading (page load)?</li>
<li>And many others...</li>
</ul>
<p>For years, Navigation Timing was the standard that folks used to measure their performance, but over time it became clear that there were significant issues with this approach. Firstly, navigation-centered metrics are highly variable based on your tech choices - the size of your assets combined with where, when, and how you include them in your markup can dramatically change the navigation timing values of your page. If your site (like many) switches from a fully server-rendered page to a client-rendered SPA, you'll see vastly different values reported for navigation metrics, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your site's performance got better or worse.</p>
<p>This is because Navigation Timing metrics measure milestones which are meaningful to a <em>web browser</em>, but often completely invisible to a <em>user</em>. If you ask a human being how fast a page loaded on their phone, they aren't going to respond with "when the DOM was fully constructed" or "when all the site's assets were downloaded and parsed". They'll answer based on when the content appears on screen, when the main image or header text was fully rendered, or when they were able to click/tap/scroll to interact with the page.</p>
<p>To bring us closer to a world where we can measure performance in a way that matters to the people that use the web, the industry has more recently shifted away from navigation timings towards new, <em>user-centered</em> metrics that better reflect the experience of users.</p>
<h2 id="enter-core-web-vitals">Enter Core Web Vitals <a href="#enter-core-web-vitals">#</a></h2>
<p>Google's answer to the question of what metrics best represent the experience of users are three metrics that they are calling <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a>:<br>
<em>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</em>, which measures  the amount of time (in ms) that it takes for the largest (and probably most important) thing on the page to render,<br>
<em>First Input Delay (FID)</em>, which measures the amount of time (in ms) that it takes for a page to respond to user input such as tapping/clicking/scrolling/etc,<br>
<em>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</em>, which is a fraction representing how much the layout of the page changes during load (e.g. that annoying thing where you go to tap a link but the page has shifted the location of the link out from under you).</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I am pro-Core Web Vitals! These metrics, what they measure, and the fact that Google is holding sites accountable for their performance is a huge step forward for the web. Developers who have struggled to get buy-in from leadership now have a rock-solid business case for investing in performance improvements. The folks at Google who worked on Core Web Vitals are lovely people who have the best of intentions and truly believe in the importance of performance to move the web forward.</p>
<p>I'm just not quite ready to jump on the Core Web Vitals hype train. Google has chosen to include metrics in Core Web Vitals that meet <em>Google's</em> needs, and I'm not convinced that Google's goals and our goals as web performance practitioners are exactly the same thing.</p>
<h2 id="vital-for-whom%3F">Vital for whom? <a href="#vital-for-whom%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>The Core Web Vital metrics - LCP, FID, and CLS - measure common <em>annoyances</em> that would cause a user to get frustrated and bounce early after clicking a link, especially on their first visit to a site or page. And, because these metrics are all tech-stack agnostic, they can be used to compare sites against each other, unlike traditional Navigation Timing metrics. It doesn't matter if you serve static HTML with no javascript, or a framework-powered SPA that renders completely on the client, or any of myriad possible frontend technology choices in between - Core Web Vitals measurements are comparable across every site on the internet.</p>
<p>So, from a business perspective, the metrics that were included in Core Web Vitals make total sense <em>for Google</em>. Their search business is predicated on returning a list of relevant links - links that users click on and stay at (one could argue that because of advertising revenue Google would want people to constantly go back to the results list, but if users don't find Google's results relevant, then they won't keep using the service). And, Google needs to be able to compare millions of sites with different tech stacks against each other in order to provide the best, least bounce-inducing results.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, however, I don't think LCP, FID, and CLS <em>alone</em> give us a complete picture of our sites' performance. There are significant gaps in what Core Web Vitals measure, so I think it's important to temper our enthusiasm with a frank discussion of the shortcomings of these metrics.</p>
<h2 id="the-browser-problem">The browser problem <a href="#the-browser-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the main problems I see with Core Web Vitals is the lack of cross-browser support. Two of the three (LCP and CLS) are currently only available in Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. The third, FID, is supported natively in Chrome via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming">PerformanceEventTiming API</a>, or is <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/first-input-delay">available via a polyfill</a> that site owners need to individually add to their markup in order to track FID on their own.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately a pervasive and frustrating issue in the performance community - many important and useful new metrics are only supported in Chrome. I’m happy that folks at Google are working hard to push the state of performance monitoring forward with these awesome and useful new metrics, but if we focus on them alone (Vitals or otherwise), we exclude a significant portion of traffic from our performance monitoring.</p>
<p>There's a tendency to dismiss this concern because "all modern browsers are pretty much the same, so Chrome is representative of all of our traffic", but that is far from the reality I've seen from analyzing millions of data points that show pretty clear differences between browser performance. Modern browsers may support similar features, but under the hood, they handle loading, rendering, and javascript execution in different ways, and it feels short-sighted and injudicious to simply ignore the experiences of huge swaths of users simply because we can’t use these new metrics to do so.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem, of course, is that other browser vendors need to start providing these super important metrics to developers! Until that beautiful day comes, I don't think we should dismiss other non-Vitals timings wholesale, or stop searching for creative cross-browser ways to measure real user performance. At Etsy, for example, we implemented a custom user timing that logs when our SVG logo renders. This measures approximately the same value as FCP (within a 50ms standard deviation), and is available in all browsers, even back to IE10!</p>
<h2 id="the-business-outcome-problem">The business outcome problem <a href="#the-business-outcome-problem">#</a></h2>
<p>Another issue with the metrics selected for Core Web Vitals is that it's been hard to correlate changes in FID and CLS with business outcomes, and even harder to do causal analysis when we see regressions. Note that we don't yet have enough historical LCP data to know how useful it will be, but based on FCP analysis I am expecting LCP to be highly correlated with business outcomes, unlike the other two Core Web Vitals.</p>
<p>FID, in particular, has proven to be a highly subjective measurement that isn't always useful when viewed in isolation. FID is ostensibly supposed to be measuring the effect of thread-blocking Javascript execution, but our FID RUM values are most often logged when a user clicks on a navigation link that takes them to another page.</p>
<p>FID data is also difficult to analyze, because in reality it can change either because you are blocking the thread for a longer period, or because you changed the user interface in a way that changes user behavior. Disentangling experimental results that have an ambiguous cause is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>To give an example of how FID is an unreliable tool for measuring user outcomes: Let's say we load images in a row of search results faster. This causes users to click on search results earlier than before, but now this interaction happens while Javascript fired at DCL is still executing, so FID increases. Should we undo that change and go back to loading the images slower? If we <em>only</em> looked at Core Web Vitals, then the answer would be "CLS and LCP stayed the same, but FID degraded, so we should probably undo the change". However the real, nuanced answer is more like "Long tasks didn't increase alongside FID, so it seems like we changed user …</p></div></article></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have the answer to the NVIDIA A100 GPU from its chief (current) competitor, the AMD Instinct MI100. While the NVIDIA A100 GPU is getting a bump from 40GB to 80GB today, AMD is touting a new architecture specifically to deliver a lot of HPC flops at a low cost. Let us get into the new CDNA offering. <strong>Update</strong>: AMD let us know there is no “Radeon” in the product name since it is CDNA so we are updating the article to reflect that.<span id="more-48498"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Background</h2>
<p>Keeping the background brief, the AMD Instinct MI100 is an architecture designed differently. AMD realized that traditional GPUs, insofar as they are “graphics” processing, are inefficient by including the logic that helps quickly render games. As a result, AMD split their GPU efforts into RDNA for the gaming community, as we covered in the recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-6800-xt-6800-rdna-2/">AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT 6800 XT and 6800 Launch</a>. For the data center, we have CDNA.</p>

<p>In all of these background slides, there are not so subtle jabs at NVIDIA. For example, above, we have “General Purpose” which is effectively NVIDIA’s Ampere design. Below, AMD is pointing out that it has public DoE exascale wins. Intel does as well (although perhaps HPE-Cray was the big winner here) and NVIDIA did not win in that first round of exascale contracts.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is doing more than high-performance computing for supercomputers with its chips, instead of focusing on AI acceleration with features such as supporting sparsity. As a result, the raw FP64 performance gains are not as large enough to meet exascale needs per AMD.</p>

<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Overview</h2>
<p>The AMD Instinct MI100 GPU is the company’s new offering in the HPC compute space for GPUs. We are going to discuss the “Peak Performance / $ Compared to A100” in a moment, but let us get to the main specs first.</p>

<p>We can see that we have a 11.5 TFLOP (peak) GPU that fits into a standard PCIe Gen4 x16 slot. Something that we wanted to mention is that Infinity Fabric Link. The Instinct MI100 is designed to run in four GPU “hives” as shown in this article’s cover image. AMD is using Infinity Fabric to provide more performance than PCIe Gen4 for GPU-to-GPU communication much like NVIDIA NVLink. We asked AMD about the 32GB HBM2 capacity given NVIDIA was already at 40GB before the 80GB is being simultaneously announced with the MI100. AMD said it was a sweet spot to control costs for HPC customers much like HPC customers often care more about filling memory channels than with hitting high memory capacity on CPUs.</p>

<p>A lot of the speedup comes from the new pipeline. Here is what the “Enhanced Compute Unit” looks like. We have some readers that will skip this, other that will want to see details. AMD has a new whitepaper out with more details but otherwise, feel free to read the chart if you want to understand more about what AMD is doing at a very low level.</p>

<p>The net impact is that the AMD Instinct MI100 is a single 300W PCIe card that is 11.5 TFLOPs peak. AMD did an obligatory comparison of its new 300W PCIe GPU to the 2000 #1 supercomputer using 6MW and occupying many racks. 2000 was a long time ago in computing terms and back when Intel Pentium was still a premium brand.</p>

<p>A bit part of what AMD is discussing is compute per dollar and performance per dollar. Having less memory onboard its new 7nm GPU helps with 32GB of HBM2 versus 40GB or 80GB from NVIDIA. At the same time, with the new NVIDIA A100 80GB, NVIDIA can push the 40GB model pricing down which will have a big impact on the chart below.</p>

<p>Since we know AMD has won several Exascale computer contracts such as the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hpe-cray-and-amd-win-again-with-el-capitan-2-exaflop-supercomputer/">El Capitan 2 Exaflop Supercomputer</a>, we see ORNL as an early adopter discussing performance increases. We will note that AMD is comparing to the MI60 here not the MI50 as it did above. AMD is also comparing to the NVIDIA V100, not the current generation A100.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the buyers of these supercomputers are very smart individuals. Clearly what AMD showed them with the MI100 and future generations was good enough that NVIDIA did not win these contracts. Of course, AMD is looking to future generations of GPUs for its exascale plans, but it needs to get industry software running on its GPUs. For that, AMD has ROCm which is updated as well.</p>
<h2>AMD ROCm 4.0 Updates</h2>
<p>Part of the news is that AMD ROCm 4.0 is out. With each generation of ROCm, the company is covering more use cases and scenarios. The company has a big task where GPU compute was largely pioneered on CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs. ROCm allows AMD and its customers to easily port CUDA applications and other components to run on AMD GPUs.</p>

<p>Next year with ROCm 5.0 we will likely see a bit more about how ROCm 4.0 is incomplete but ROCm 5.0 has complete coverage. At least that is what we have been trained to expect over the past few generations. ROCm 4.0 is delivering larger performance gains which makes porting less painful for existing GPU compute users.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48508"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-rocm-4-0-speedup/" rel="attachment wp-att-48508"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup.jpg" alt="AMD ROCm 4.0 Speedup" width="1356" height="715" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup.jpg 1356w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-400x211.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-800x422.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-696x367.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-1068x563.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-ROCm-4.0-Speedup-797x420.jpg 797w" sizes="(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48508">AMD ROCm 4.0 Speedup</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is an area where those exascale DoE contracts are helping. Part of the contracts were going beyond hardware but also for developing tooling around the next-gen systems. AMD is investing in ROCm to ensure the software can run on its flagship systems as they start arriving. Intel has been talking about the benefits of <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/great-2021-intel-xeon-sapphire-rapids-with-xe-ponte-vecchio-gpu-and-oneapi-at-sc19/">OneAPI</a>, but there is a good chance AMD will power the first exascale system.</p>
<h2>AMD Instinct MI100 Partners</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, AMD’s design centers around a 4x GPU to CPU ratio. Here AMD is showing four AMD Instinct MI100 GPUs per “hive” and one hive per AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” CPU.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48505"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-32gb-cdna-gpu-launched/amd-radeon-instinct-mi100-with-epyc-cpus/" rel="attachment wp-att-48505"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs.jpg" alt="AMD Radeon Instinct MI100 With EPYC CPUs" width="1222" height="719" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs.jpg 1222w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-400x235.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-800x471.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-696x410.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-1068x628.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AMD-Radeon-Instinct-MI100-with-EPYC-CPUs-714x420.jpg 714w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48505">AMD Instinct MI100 With EPYC CPUs</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look at the cover image as well as the above, you can see that the bottom of the cards have PCIe Gen4 connectors but the top of the cards have a special bridge allowing GPU-to-CPU communication. NVIDIA has NVLink and the custom SXM4 form factor <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-4x-gpu-hgx-redstone-platform/">NVIDIA A100 4x GPU HGX Redstone platform</a>.</p>

<p>Supporting these designs are systems from HPE, Dell, Supermicro, and Gigabyte. The Dell EMC PowerEdge R7525 you may have seen in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-and-amd-showcase-future-of-servers-160-pcie-lane-design/">Dell and AMD Showcase Future of Servers 160 PCIe Lane Design</a> article. We expect these platforms to support the AMD EPYC 7003 “Milan” generation as well.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>AMD is a few quarters behind NVIDIA launching the MI100 but well ahead of Intel’s Xe HPC part. With the big headliners of two major exascale supercomputers moving to AMD, we can imagine other smaller installations will look at what AMD is offering more seriously. It is good to see that AMD has a plan to close the software and capability gap with NVIDIA.</p>

<p>In a data sensitive application debugging is the most critical and time consuming especially if requests traffic is tremendously high, when it comes to debugging every developer’s last resort is application logs and debugging in large logs file is not an easy task.</p>



<div><p>In this post I will brief you about how we can make rails logs searchable, Using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic Stack</a>&nbsp;for making debugging fast and easy via&nbsp;UI enabled log search. Wait…, Filebeat is not a separate entity it falls under an elastic stack only which is a lightweight log shipper which will not hoard your resources.</p><p>This post will cover following&nbsp;</p></div>



<ul id="block-98606f77-5ee5-4d34-b8d1-5a5a51fb1195"><li>Brief intro to Elastic Stack</li><li>Filebeat configuration and setup</li><li>Custom Index Template with rollover for application logs</li><li>Lograge setup to output logs into JSON format</li><li>Demo Rails application&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pramodshinde/efk-rails">refer this repository</a></li></ul>



<h2>Brief&nbsp;about Elastic Stack</h2>



<p>Elastic stack comprises of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html">Elasticsearch</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/logstash">Logstash</a>&nbsp;formerly known as the ELK Stack which is used to monitor, visualize, search and analyse the applications data in realtime and Filebeat is a lightweight data shipper belonging&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/">Beats family</a>&nbsp;which is mainly used to ship data from files.</p>



<h2>Filebeat setup and configuration</h2>



<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>



<p>Installation of filebeat is dead simple. You can follow simple steps described in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html">official documentation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Sample filebeat.yml</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<code>/usr/local/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml</code></p>



<pre>#---------- Filebeat inputs ----------
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  json:
    message_key: message
    keys_under_root: true
    overwrite_keys: true
  paths:
    - /Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log
#ElasticSearch template setting 
setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"
#---------- Kibana ----------
setup.kibana:
  host: "0.0.0.0:5601"
#---------- Elasticsearch output ----------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["0.0.0.0:9200"]
  index: "sync-log-dev"</pre>



<p>In above configuration file we have configured following options&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>inputs – Used for specifying input for filebeat, here we have configured input as rails log file&nbsp;<em><code>/Users/pramod/projects/efk-rails/log/sync_development.log</code></em>&nbsp;with JSON option which will decode logs structured as JSON messages&nbsp;</li><li>output – Used to set the output for filebeat, here we will write to elasticsearch indexes.&nbsp;</li><li>setup.kibana – the Kibana endpoint which will load the kibana dashboard</li></ul>



<h2>Custom Index Template with rollover</h2>



<p>We off course can use the default&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/ilm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover</a>&nbsp;options but you cannot use the custom index template names, this is specially needed if you want the setup environment&nbsp;wise kibana dashboards on a single kibana and elasticsearch instances and this is what we needed in most of the Rails applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here we will use the custom template and index lifecycle management (ilm) for rotating our logs indexes as per different rails environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable a custom index template name and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rollover policy</a>&nbsp;you need to follow the following steps</p>



<ol><li>Setup a ilm enabled to false, add custom template name and pattern with following options</li></ol>



<pre>setup.ilm.enabled: false
setup.template.enabled: false
setup.template.name: "efk-rails-sync-dev"
setup.template.pattern: "efk-rails-sync-dev-*"</pre>



<p>Above config will tell filebeat to use&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-*</code>&nbsp;name and index pattern respectively, It’s a common practice to specify the index pattern rather than using index name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Create a life cycle policy using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _ilm/policy/sync-log
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_age": "3d",
            "max_size": "100mb"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "2d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>Above will create a index lifecycle policy which will rollover indexes if its size reaches to 100mb or index age is 3 days whichever turns first true.</p>



<p>3. Create template pattern using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html">Kibana dev tool</a></p>



<pre>PUT _template/efk-rails-sync-dev
{
  "index_patterns": ["efk-rails-sync-dev-*"], 
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.lifecycle.name": "sync-log", 
    "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "sync-log-dev" 
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create a template&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev</code>&nbsp;with index alias&nbsp;<code>sync-log-dev</code>&nbsp;and attach lifecycle policy&nbsp;<code>sync-log</code>that created in step 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. In last step we will create the first index managed by a policy that uses the rollover action and designate it as the write index</p>



<pre>PUT efk-rails-sync-dev-000001 
{
  "aliases": {
    "sync-log-dev":{
      "is_write_index": true
    }
  }
}</pre>



<p>This will create initial index&nbsp;<code>efk-rails-sync-dev-000001</code>&nbsp;which will be used by filebeat to write output of application.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Application logs in JSON format&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once you create index life cycle policy, template and first rollover index which will capture logs from filebeat harvester. You need make your application logs to output in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>To output rails logs into JSON format, we are using&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge" target="_blank">lograge</a>&nbsp;gem once you add it in Gemfile and bundle install it will be available to use in you application.&nbsp;</p><p>For demo purpose, We will be logging only single controller actions into JSON and search via Kibana.&nbsp;</p><p>Following lograge configuration will output logs in JSON for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>$config/initializers/lograge.rb</p>



<pre>Rails.application.configure do
  config.lograge.enabled = true
  config.lograge.keep_original_rails_log = true
  config.lograge.base_controller_class = 'ActionController::API'
  config.lograge.logger = ActiveSupport::Logger.new "#{Rails.root}/log/sync_#{Rails.env}.log"
  config.lograge.formatter = Lograge::Formatters::Json.new
  config.lograge.ignore_custom = lambda do |event|
    # return true here if you want to ignore based on the event
    return false if event.payload[:controller].include?("SyncController") &amp;&amp;
     ['index', 'create'].include?(event.payload[:action])
    return true
  end
  config.lograge.custom_payload do |controller|
    if controller.class.name.include?('SyncController')
      SyncLogger.new(controller).log_data
    end
  end
end</pre>



<p>SyncLogger service to add some meta data to logger file</p>



<p>$app/services/sync_logger.rb</p>



<pre>class SyncLogger
  def initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
  end
  def log_data
    request_type = @controller.request.method
    username = @controller.current_user.try(:username) || 'guest'
    r_data = request_type == 'GET' ? JSON.parse(@controller.response.body) : @controller.request.parameters
    log_data = {
      u_agent: @controller.request.user_agent,
      request_time: Time.now.to_s(:number),
      search_key: "#{request_type}_#{username}_#{Time.zone.now.to_s(:number)}",
      ip: @controller.request.ip,
      user_id: @controller.current_user.try(:id),
      username: username,
      data: r_data
    }
  end
end</pre>



<p>Above service will create JSON output for SyncContoller#index and SyncController#Create action in following format&nbsp;</p>



<p>$log/sync_development.log</p>



<pre>{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":16.64,"view":1.18,"db":0.2,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210529","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153529","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}
{"method":"GET","path":"/sync","format":"*/*","controller":"SyncController","action":"index","status":200,"duration":15.82,"view":0.48,"db":0.93,"u_agent":"PostmanRuntime/7.26.1","request_time":"20200818210647","search_key":"GET_pramod_20200818153647","ip":"127.0.0.1","user_id":1,"username":"pramod","data":[{"username":"pramod"},{"username":"pramdo1"}]}</pre>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-starting.html" target="_blank">Starting filebeat</a>&nbsp;to ship above logs to elasticsearch by executing following command from the root of the filebeat if you have downloaded the tar and extracted it or if you have installed filebeat as a service you can start filebeat as a service</p>



<pre>./filebeat -e
or 
sudo service filebeat start</pre>



<p>You should see following filebeat logs on successful</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/careers/remote-work/countries-with-remote-worker-visa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote worker visas</a> grow in popularity, freelancers are often left out of the equation. Classified by many countries as a “small business,” there are often strict rules for long stays. Abu Dhabi is trying to fix that. While Dubai has a visa for remote employees, Abu Dhabi just launched a visa for freelancers in 48 categories, according to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED).&nbsp;</p><p>The remote freelancer visa used to only be available to residents. Non-residents required an employer to sponsor their visa to move to the Emirate. While remote worker visas for employees launched in Dubai, Abu Dhabi remained separate and kept its own rules.&nbsp;Previously, only residents and citizens of the UAE could apply for the special freelancer visa. That’s now been expanded to include non-residents.</p><figure><div><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ADDED permits licensing for Freelancer activities for citizens and non-citizens within 48 economic activities. This decision falls under the general guidelines of the individual institutions, with the possibility of working from home or any other location. <a href="https://t.co/GqLfqLyF5s">pic.twitter.com/GqLfqLyF5s</a></p>— دائرة التنمية الاقتصادية – أبوظبي (@AbuDhabiDED) <a href="https://twitter.com/AbuDhabiDED/status/1327989036187869184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div></div></figure><h2>Details of the Abu Dhabi freelancer visa</h2><p>According to the <a href="https://www.adbc.gov.ae/CitizenAccess/Help/FreelanceLicenseActivitiesEN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADDED</a>, freelancers in the following industries could qualify for the visa: fashion design, clothing, natural and aesthetic flowers arrangement, photography studio, event photography, videography, event management, gift packaging, jewellery design, web design, project design and management services, translation, calligraphy, drawing, statistical consultations, agricultural guidance and marketing operations management.</p><p>On top of that list, English-language Arabian news site <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2020/11/16/Abu-Dhabi-offers-UAE-residents-new-freelancer-licenses-for-48-activities-The-facts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AlArabiya</a> quotes Abu Dhabi’s state news agency WAM, saying, “consultations related to lifestyle development, marketing studies, parliamentary studies, banking and marketing services in the fields of energy, space and logistical consultations, fitness, art works, sculpting, handicrafts, printing services, photocopying, gardening and landscaping, printing on textiles or clothes, plastering, engraving, decoration and soap-making can be practiced with the license.”</p><p>Qualification for the visa, though, is not as easy for freelancers as for employees. According to the ADDED official Twitter page, freelancers must prove the following in order to qualify: Proof of expertise such as a university degree, certificate, or accredited accomplishments and details of your contracts such as working hours, holidays, and general requirements. If your clients are public sector (e.g. government), you will need special approval from the UAE government to work locally as a freelancer.</p><figure><div><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><div lang="und" dir="rtl"><p>يتوجب على المتقدمين بطلب الحصول على رخصة المهن الحرة من غير المواطنين استيفاء شروط اللائحة التنظيمية التي حددتها الدائرة.</p><p>Non-citizens applying to obtain a Freelancer license must fulfil the requirements of the regulatory regulations set by the department. <a href="https://t.co/tZ8M8vkSin">pic.twitter.com/tZ8M8vkSin</a></p></div>— دائرة التنمية الاقتصادية – أبوظبي (@AbuDhabiDED) <a href="https://twitter.com/AbuDhabiDED/status/1327998588702568448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div></div></figure><h2>The wave of remote work tourism</h2><p>There’s a lot of discussion about whether <a href="https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/is-remote-work-residency-the-new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote work residency is the new vacation</a>. As countries seek to regain revenues lost to the COVID-19 pandemic, extended stays to remote workers is a key strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>While living in a castle or on the beach for a year is a huge draw, there’s more to it. First you have to figure out what you’ll do for transportation, food, shelter, and essential services. Then you have to ensure your home life is taken care of whatever that means for you.</p><h4><strong>Read next</strong>: <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/careers/remote-work/applying-for-a-remote-worker-visa-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Before applying for a remote worker visa, don’t forget these things</a>.</h4></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



		<div>



			
<p>In Denmark it is possible to register domains with funny characters such as æ, ø and å. And we do. One prominent example is our national portal for booking Covid-19 tests at <a href="https://xn--coronaprver-ngb.dk/">https://coronaprøver.dk</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">Wikipedia calls these beasts Internationalised domain names</a>, so they must indeed exist.</p>



<p>Recently I quit my job (have a new one now, luckily) and found myself making posts on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">social network known as LinkedIn</a> to improve my prospects.</p>



<p>One of these posts was about about a hobby project I made called <a href="https://wishlist.dk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://wishlist.dk">wishlist.dk</a>, an ad free wish registry. The big player on the Danish wish registry market (what a market: it seems every novice web developer in Denmark has launched one of these) is <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/">https://<strong>ø</strong>nskeskyen.dk</a>.</p>



<p>What I wanted to let my network know was something like:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I have launched wishlist.dk – a gratis, ad and surveilance free alternative to evil wish list giant ønskeskyen.dk”</p><cite>– Morten Helmstedt, job seeker</cite></blockquote>



<p>Alas, LinkedIn’s URL parser breaks in many ways when trying to express your career news and feelings through internationalised domain names.</p>



<h3>How do thee fail? Let me count the ways.</h3>



<p>When making a post on LinkedIn with an URL, LinkedIn will try to:</p>



<ul><li>Create a preview of the first URL in the post</li><li>Create a short link for all URLs in the post containing a path (e.g. https://lindkedin.com/<em>path</em>), not for top level domains and subdomains without a path. It will generally look like and point to something like <em>https://lnkd.in/eCTD8Q9</em></li></ul>



<p>Here are the bugs I noticed in action:</p>



<h4>Posting like a sane person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="545" height="352" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1.png 545w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin1-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"><figcaption>Trying to post an internationalised domain name like any sane person would. Post preview fails to load. The link in the post itself works as expected, though.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Posting like a LinkedIn person</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="550" height="648" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2.png 550w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin2-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><figcaption>Whois’ing the “real” domain name and posting it like no true Dane would. Post preview succeeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Things go from bad to worse when trying to post an internationalised domain name with a path such as <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://ønskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a>.</p>



<p>If I just post that URL, I get a post like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png" alt="" width="540" height="142" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3.png 540w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin3-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>LinkedIn shortens the link to make it more readable and to be able to track our smallest actions on the world wide web.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What happens when I click the link is this:</p>



<h4>INVALID REDIRECT</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="773" height="319" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4.png 773w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-300x124.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin4-768x317.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px"><figcaption>An error! (Invalid redirect)</figcaption></figure>



<p>My browser (Firefox) tries to GET the URL and is redirected to <em>linkedin.com/slink</em>:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="374" height="235" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5.png 374w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin5-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><figcaption>A 301 redirect in action!</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="357" height="381" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6.png 357w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin6-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px"><figcaption>The submitted URL is stored, but the location should probably be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://%C3%B8nskeskyen.dk/text/cookies</a> or maybe even <a href="https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies">https://xn--nskeskyen-k8a.dk/text/cookies</a>. Who knows? It’s complicated. LinkedIn engineers should definitely look into this!</figcaption></figure>



<h2>How I tried to fix this mess</h2>



<p>Well, I contacted LinkedIn on Twitter (WHAT!), tried e-mailing their security e-mail (no reply, of course, but only e-mail I could find) and got in touch with a very understanding Member Support Consultant named Vegard who tried his/her best:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="797" height="508" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8.png 797w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-300x191.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin8-768x490.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"><figcaption>Pretty impressive response after describing the problem.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>If our URL parser doesn’t work, just change your URL</h4>



<p>But then the engineering team told me that I should just stop posting internationalised domain names to LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png" alt="" width="610" height="471" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9.png 808w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-300x232.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin9-768x593.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px"><figcaption>True for Chrome, not for Firefox, not from a usability perspective</figcaption></figure>



<p>I tried to have Vegard tell the engineers at LinkedIn to read up on internationalised domain names, but no such luck: </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="793" height="571" src="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png" alt="" srcset="https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10.png 793w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-300x216.png 300w, https://helmstedt.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/linkedin10-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"><figcaption>The sorry end.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>THE END</h2>



<h2>An aside:</h2>



<p>As another hobby project, I created <a href="https://lnk.dk/">lnk.dk</a>, a very simple short link generator (like wish registries, it seems every aspiring web developer in Denmark has made one of these). Using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>‘s built in <code>URLField</code> I can validate, store and correctly redirect internationalised domain names with hardly any work at all on my part.</p>



<p><em>If only tools like that were available for the engineers at LinkedIn to use for their URL parsing and shortening…</em></p>

<p>Typically we tend to overestimate what’s possible in a short time, and underestimate what’s possible over a longer time frame. But in showing people <a href="https://anvil.works/">Anvil</a> we’ve found an odd exception – they tend to <em>underestimate</em> what they can build in as little as a day!</p>

<p>So I decided to put it to the test. I asked, <strong>What can I build in one working day with Anvil?</strong></p>

<p>Since I’m tracking my own time for this challenge, it seemed natural to build a time tracking app - something like <a href="https://clockify.me/">Clockify</a>. Clockify has a ton of features, so I decided to pick some essentials and aimed for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This is my project report, detailing the progress and timings.</p>

<p>Everything I built here, I wrote between lunchtime one day and lunchtime the next – so, I did this all in one working day!</p>

<h2 id="spoiler">Spoiler:</h2>

<p>Here’s how it looked in the end:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/clockify_intro.gif" alt="Clockify intro"> <figcaption>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>You can open the source code for the final app here:
</p>


<hr>

<h2 id="scoping-my-mvp">Scoping my MVP</h2>

<p>To build an MVP, you you need to work out how much functionality you really need to be viable. I decided my MVP would need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-user support allowing for new user sign-ups</li>
<li>One or Zero live Time Trackers per user at any one time</li>
<li>Each Time Tracker should:

<ul>
<li>be linked to a Project</li>
<li>have notes and tags</li>
<li>be easily editable and deletable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each Project should have:

<ul>
<li>a color</li>
<li>a client</li>
<li>an hourly rate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphical Reports by project and day</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-app-structure-1-hour">1. App Structure (1 hour)</h2>

<p>With a project this big, it took me an hour to get a skeleton of the app in place. That included the database, login and signup, and placeholders for all the screens in the app.</p>

<p>The first 15 minutes were dedicated to setting up and organising the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables">Data Tables</a>, and creating the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/ui#forms">Forms</a> which make up the UI:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/datatables.png" alt="Data Table Structure"> <figcaption>
                <p>Data Table Structure</p>
            </figcaption>

</div>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/form_structure.png" alt="Form structure"> <figcaption>
                <p>Form structure</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>The next 15 minutes were spent adding multi-user support with Anvil’s <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/users">Users Service</a>, and redirecting the user to either a Login Form or Main App depending on whether the user had a remembered login or not.</p>

<p>Next, I spent 15 minutes creating and wiring up the Login / Signup UI:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/sign_up_form.png" alt="Sign-up Form"> <figcaption>
                <p>Sign-up Form</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>Finally, I implemented the Main App navigation. I linked the side nav and top nav bar to relevant pages within the app, changing the role of the active side nav link to <code>'selected'</code> when clicked.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/navigation.gif" alt="Navigation"> <figcaption>
                <p>Navigation</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="2-global-data-and-user-settings-40-mins">2. Global Data and User Settings (40 mins)</h2>

<p>From the <a href="#scoping-my-mvp">requirements</a>, some basic user data would need to be created after a new sign up.</p>

<p>Once logged in, I made single <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/server#calling-server-functions-from-client-code">server call</a> to get relevant user data from the Data Table to the client, then stored it as variables in a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/python/modules">Data Module</a>. To speed up development, it seemed sensible to send <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables/data-security#views">client writable views</a> of data associated with the logged-in user.</p>

<div title="Server-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Get the current logged-in user</span>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>users</span><span>.</span><span>get_user</span><span>()</span>
<span># Client writable view of the timetracker table containing rows belonging to the current user</span>
<span>time_trackers</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_tables</span><span>.</span><span>timetracker</span><span>.</span><span>client_writable</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>=</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>time_trackers</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>Next, I implemented a settings page to edit the default hourly rate and preferred currency. I used an <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/python/alerts-and-notifications">modal dialog</a> for data entry, and included some data validation to ensure the hourly rate was non-negative.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/hourly_rate.png" alt="Settings Page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Settings Page</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="3-projects-page-40-mins">3. Projects Page (40 mins)</h2>

<p>The Projects Page was its own CRUD app. The user can create a new Project with a <code>title</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>client</code> and <code>hourly_rate</code>. All projects are listed in a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/data-grids">Data Grid</a>. The alert/modal used to create a new project was reused to update a current project.</p>

<p>Selecting a color was a nice UI feature. I wrote the UI for this in code rather than Anvil’s Drag and Drop interface, creating a 9x9 grid of selectable colours.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/clockify/projects_page.png" alt="Projects Page"> <figcaption>
                <p>Projects Page</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>I used a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables/data-security#views">client writable view</a> of the ‘Projects’ Data Table, so that there was no need to worry about sending data back to the server – I could securely update my data from client code. (If you’re interested in how this works, Meredydd gave a <a href="https://anvil.works/blog/pycon18-making-the-web-more-pythonic">short talk about it</a> at PyCon 2018.)</p>

<hr>



<p>The Clients and Tags pages were two more mini CRUD apps. These were far simpler than the projects page. The interfaces were identical. I considered refactoring them into a single Form but figured, at this stage, it was best to keep them separate. The modularity of Anvil Forms meant I could reuse the Clients/Tags Forms in the Settings page.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/clockify/tags.gif" alt="Tags"> <figcaption>
                <p>Tags</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="5-a-false-start-1-hour-30-minutes">5. A False Start (1 hour 30 minutes)</h2>

<p>Next, I started on the <strong>Time Tracking Page</strong> – but by this point it was the end of the afternoon, and I was getting tired. I could tell my working memory was getting overloaded with manipulating the data views.</p>

<p>It wasn’t <em>completely</em> wasted, but I did end up going down some blind alleys. Lesson learned: I should should have taken a break sooner!</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="6-next-morning-finish-time-tracking-page-1-hour-15-mins">6. Next Morning - Finish Time Tracking Page (1 hour 15 mins)</h2>

<p>Having slept on it, I came back fresh the next morning, and the issues I’d experienced at the end of the previous day seemed obvious now! I finished the time tracking page in just over an hour:</p>

</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="7-reports-page-1-hour-30-mins">7. Reports Page (1 hour 30 mins)</h2>

<p>Now that I had time tracking data, it needed to be organised by date and project. It took 40 minutes to get the data into a format that could be plotted.</p>

<p>The next 50 mins were spent creating the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/plots">Plots</a>. Most of that time was spent reading Plotly documentation to format the plots the way I wanted, using the right colors, adjusting the headings, changing the hover text, etc. The results looked pretty nice:</p>

</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="8-testing-and-cherry-on-the-top-40-mins">8. Testing and Cherry on the Top (40 mins)</h2>

<p>I spent the last hour testing the UI and fixing a few obvious bugs – that took around 30 minutes. Just before lunch, I added a cherry on top: I used Javascript to the tab title display the time from the active Time Tracker, if one existed:</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="9-responsiveness-no-time">9. Responsiveness - No Time</h2>

<p>Anvil takes care of much of the responsiveness. And so I got a mobile-friendly UI for free!</p>

</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="total-build-time-7-hrs-45-minutes">Total Build Time - 7 hrs 45 minutes</h2>

<p>In one day, I built a multi-user time tracker with data, reports, projects – and it’s not bad looking, either! Each time tracker is linked to projects, tags and clients, and there are screens to configure all of them. I also created a reports page and implemented a neat javascript function to display the value of the current time tracker in the tab title.</p>

<p>Here it is! A fully-featured time tracking system, built entirely in Anvil:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/b315846a-e37e-49db-ac36-3625b7ed3cf6-wenyan-ide.png" alt="" width="" height="">The Wenyan-lang <em>Hello World</em> program reads like this:</p>
<pre>吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。</pre>
<p>Even those of us who don't understand the characters can likely recognize it as a form of Natural Language Programming—a programming language whose code mimics prose—in its wordiness and its structure as sentences. In fact, Wenyan is built on its namesake, Classical Chinese (or Wényán), the written form of Chinese used from the 5th century BCE to the early 20th century. Because Wenyan-lang's inventive feature occurs in the nuance and humor of its <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/chef-multicoding-esolang-aesthetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multicoding</a> between Classical Chinese and code, as a non-reader, I am exploring this language through the insights of others. Yidi Tsao, a Berlin-based artist, curator and writer, explains that the text the Hello World actually prints (you can see it between the quotes 「「 and 」」) translates not to "Hello, World!" but closer to "Greetings to Heaven and Earth."</p>
<p>The humor and poetry in its engagement with Wényán become more clear in longer examples. In the <a href="https://ide.wy-lang.org/?file=beer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>99 Bottles program</em></a> below (translated and notated by Tsao), beer is replaced with the more era-appropriate wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>吾有一言。曰「「春日宴。」」。書之。<br>I have a word, called “spring feast”.</p>
<p>有數九。名之曰「酒數」。<br>There are nine numbers. I call it "wine number". (note: 九 nine and 酒 wine are homophones in Chinese.)</p>
<p>恆為是。若「酒數」等於零者乃止也。<br>It is always like that. It only stops when "wine number" is zero.</p>
<p>吾有三言。曰「「與君」」。曰「酒數」。<br> I have three words. one is "with you". The other is "wine number".</p>
<p>曰「「杯酒。可以窮歡宴。綠酒一杯歌一遍。」」。書之。<br> It says, "glasses of wine. All the fun of the feast. A glass of green wine then a song."</p>
<p>減「酒數」以一。昔之「酒數」者。今其是矣云云。<br>Minus one from "wine number". Previous "wine number", now is this.</p>
<p>吾有一言。曰「「綠酒千杯腸已爛。」」。書之。<br>I have a word. It says "thousands of glasses of wine. my stomach is done."</p>
<p>The phrases came from a poem called "to Wang Han Yang" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Li Bai</a>, who is famous for his drinking habit, also the greatest poet in Chinese history. :D</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lingdong Huang, Wenyan-lang's designed, was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon at the beginning of the project. He designed the language itself in four days to avoid studying during finals week. But it was important to Lingdong, who majored in art as well as computer science, to then create an IDE that's not just sophisticated but beautifully presents the code. It rivals mainstream languages to the point that the first Hacker News discussion had to explain to some that it was an art piece. Below is the <em>99 Bottles</em> program as it appears in Wenyan-lang's <a href="https://ide.wy-lang.org/?file=helloworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web-based development environment</a>. It not only displays the program transpiled to JavaScript (with context-coloring for both the JS and Wenyan versions) but also formatted in columns, in the style of an ancient Chinese manuscript:</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/0fcda54e-e529-43da-8a53-f8be953e51ab-wenyan-99bottles.png" alt="" width="885" height="949"><br><em>99 Bottles </em>program in Wenyan-lang interpreter</p>
<p>Lingdong looked to Chinese art for inspiration on the visual presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve taught myself traditional painting a few years ago, and have been reading Chinese classics since very young. I enjoy the minimalistic aesthetics of Song Dynasty the most. My favorite Chinese artist is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni_Zan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ni Zan</a>, known for his extremely bleak yet serene landscape paintings in washed out ink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other projects of Lingdong's reflect this confluence of art and programming. Before creating Wenyan, he designed the <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/rrpl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recursive Radical Packing Language</a>, a clever system for describing arbitrary Chinese characters on a grid (somewhat reminiscent of the Letter Spirit project), and then combining grids together to build more complex composite forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wenyan-lang was quickly recognized by a larger community of programmers and contributors toward a growing Wenyan ecosystem. Wenyan-lang now transpiles not only to JS, but Python, Ruby, and C++. Lingdong, who is described by one professor as shy, was at first a bit overwhelmed by the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally it was purely for fun, but apparently from the feature requests it seems that we Chinese programmers tend to be very practical people. I think being artistic and practical is not mutually exclusive events for wenyan-lang. Despite being needlessly archaic, the syntax itself is quite expressive actually, as it’s modeled on the Classical Chinese language, which is very expressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussions on its <a href="https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub issue pages</a> exploded early not only about programmatic fixes but what would best fit the spirit of Classical Chinese.&nbsp;Most of this discussion is in Chinese, and some in Classical Chinese. The project now has more stars on Github than major projects like Microsoft's Roslyn compiler. The fact that the discussions are not in English may explain why a project with such a huge following has not received more press here.</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/4eb3059b-8ad7-44db-8d40-597285d62482-wenyan-book.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Lingdong and others wrote a manual for Wenyan in Classical Chinese, in physical book form and online as <a href="https://book.wy-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an enormous side-scrolling volume</a>. It begins with a philosophical statement of purpose according to Tsao’s translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is programming? It’s to control machines. What is a machine? It’s to replace human labour. Because it has a wide range of capacities and its speed is fast.</p>
<p>Only it is not so intelligent. so we need wise people to programme it. When you write lines of codes, it’s like military commands. It’s like prescriptions.</p>
<p>We call it algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wenyan-lang is part of a movement of programming languages that challenge English as the default (usually only) source for keywords. <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ramsey-nasser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramsey Nasser</a>'s Arabic programming language 'alb is perhaps the best-known example. However, the lexicon of 'alb (like most programming languages and LISPs in particular) is modest compared to Wenyan-lang's. Just as programmers in Asia who might have no other use for the Roman character-set need to memorize words like "function" and "return" to write in C#, English-speakers could take the time to memorize the commands of 'alb, adjust to its right-to-left script, and write code just fine; it doesn't take a functioning knowledge of Arabic, which is a far larger commitment.</p>
<p>This can be contrasted with <a href="http://joncorbett.ca/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Corbett</a>'s Cree#, which adopts not only the Canadian Syllabic alphabet for its keywords, but also the Cree traditions of storytelling to structure programs. To use Cree#, you must not only adjust to a different set of keywords, but to understand how those stories are transmitted, including steps to placate the mischievous Raven responsible for code execution. Corbett's work and other languages challenging the cultural dominance of English is explored in a chapter ("FLOW-MATIC") in Mark Marino's recent book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-code-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Critical Code Studies</em></a> (and Cree# will be discussed at length in an upcoming esoteric.codes interview with Corbett).<em><br></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brannerchinese.com/sinology/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Branner</a>, a Computational Lexicographer whose PhD focused on Chinese dialectology, puts Wenyan somewhere between these two, with a lexical toolbox much larger than that of 'alb but without the unusual language features of Cree#.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The multi-character expressions of Wenyan-Lang are indivisible primitives — they are whole units, and parsed so as to correspond to specific elements of the grammar. In contrast, most multi-character expressions in Wényán can be analyzed compositionally, as sequences of single-character primitives.... For instance, the string 所餘幾何 literally "that which is extra, by how much" — that is, "how much remains" — represents an operator for modulus remainders. Its second character, 餘 "to be extra", also appears in another primitive in the grammar, but there is no relationship between the two primitives — internally, they're independent of one another. You could replace the characters with unique emoji or other symbols, one to one, and it would work just as well (except that it would no longer be readable to people who know some Wényán).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, despite Wenyan-lang's relative wordiness, it functions very much like other programming languages, <a href="https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan/wiki/Syntax-Cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with keywords that don't change meaning contextually</a>. He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wenyan-Lang project is a tour de force. It's a delight to read, and I'm excited to see a significant range of libraries being developed for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since creating Wenyan-lang, Lingdong has continued his work in language design, recently creating <a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/wax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wax</a>, a language intended to be a "common subset" of most major imperative programming languages. Its LISP-like syntax (although Wax is procedural) strips away much of the complexity and eccentricities of these languages, allowing for a quick way to mock up an idea which can then be transpiled into C++, Python, TypeScript, or a host of other languages. It is like a Toki Pona of programming, embracing simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p>However, the continuing interest in and expansion of Wenyan has also kept him busy. Asked about the future of this growing language, Lingdong looks to the adoption of his esolang in mainstream programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the real art would be that one day it is actually used for production code. Then we'll be living in art :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                  
<p>Having an effective test automation system is an absolute necessity in today’s agile software development environments. Automation works great, especially in case of smoke and regression tests and helps the QA teams to easily create and execute test cases that are complex in nature. </p>



<p>Though automation can act as a power booster for your product pipeline of development projects, there are certain pitfalls in automation which slow down the automation pipelines if not tackled upfront.<br></p>



<p>Here are the 7 most common test automation challenges that teams usually face while adopting automation testing along with the best solutions to overcome these pitfalls.<br></p>



<p><strong>1. Network Disconnections</strong></p>



<p>Network disconnection is a common automation challenge that a QA team faces wherein they find it hard to access databases, VPN, third party services, APIs, specific testing environments, etc. due to unstable network connections. These network disconnections cause unnecessary delays and hinder the testing process.<br></p>



<p>Apart from disconnections, another cause of worry is the inability to access virtual environments which are generally used by the testers for testing applications. QA teams need to have a good monitoring solution in place that can help fix the issue as soon as it occurs and prevent the whole software delivery pipeline from getting affected.</p>



<p><strong>2. Test Script Issues</strong></p>



<p>QA teams may face various problems related to test scripts if they lack the coding related skill sets. Teams facing these issues can leverage reusability (reusing test scripts) to solve the problems and maintain their code. They can maintain the code in a better way by treating test code as production code. Apart from this, periodic testing of the code should be done along with scheduling debugging sessions and identifying key issues with object identifiers.</p>



<p><strong>3. Fixing Code Smell</strong></p>



<p>A code smell is basically any characteristic in the code of a program that has a negative impact on the design quality. Maintaining the code quality is not only important for the programmers but also for the testers.<br></p>



<p>Fixing code smell can help a QA team achieve:</p>



<ol><li>Faster test results in lesser execution time</li><li>Help make the automation test suite more robust</li><li>Reduce maintenance cost and effort significantly</li></ol>



<p>It is not possible to find most of the code smell by manual reviewing. In many cases, automated code review tools are used to identify all the bad smell present in the source code.</p>



<p><strong>4. Testing Against Wrong Data</strong></p>



<p>In most of the cases, the QA teams are found to be testing against wrong data as it sometimes becomes difficult to get the right data. This right data is the one that the application will be processing in production.<br></p>



<p>Data relevancy and data accuracy are the two most important prerequisites for automated testing to give good results. Complicated processes and communication gaps can also prevent the testing teams from getting the updated and most relevant data.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The QA teams should use a robust reporting and analytics solution in order to achieve fast feedback and enhance the overall productivity of the team by working on the data lags.</p>



<p><strong>5. Upfront Investment</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common concerns, especially for teams not having big budgets is the high amount of investment required at the initial phase of implementing automation. In fact, the investment involved in setting up a test automation suite prevents the testers from implementing automation testing. On top of operational costs, you may have to bear licensing costs as well.<br></p>



<p>Even if you are considering using an open-source tool such as Selenium or Appium, there is a level of investment required in training the testers to use these frameworks. Here’s a good read on the<a href="https://www.stickyminds.com/article/hidden-costs-automation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> hidden costs of test automation</a>.<br></p>



<p>Convincing the stakeholders may prove to be a tough task when so many invisible costs are involved. So, it is better to choose a tool that gives you ROI. Choose an automation tool that helps you to reduce costs in all areas of your concern.<br></p>



<p><strong>6. Stability Issues</strong></p>



<p>Stability of the devices is one of the key issues with device labs as mobile devices are unstable in nature. There are many elements in mobile devices that are subject to constant change including operating systems, regular updates, performance etc. </p>



<p>The solution is to keep updating and maintaining the labs to ensure the stability and testability of the devices. Better yet – is the option or make use of a cloud-based lab having real devices to test your applications. This cloud-based lab would cost a fraction of the cost of setting up a real device lab at your location. Also, you need to pay only according to use.<br></p>



<p>If you are looking for a test automation tool, then go for one that supports extensive cross-browser testing by default and gives you the option to plug and do that when needed. An example of one such tool is <a href="https://testsigma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Testsigma</a>.</p>



<p>Testsigma lets you create test cases on the web as well as mobile and APIs in one place and execute them on real devices of your choice.</p>

 Create simple English automated tests and run your tests on the devices of your choice. No setup or ramp-up delays!</b></p>

</div>



<p><strong>7. Picking the Right Automation Tool</strong></p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/service/world-quality-report-2017-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Gemini World Quality Report</a> released in 2018, more than 50% of IT giants reported that their organization lacks suitable automation tools for their testing teams.<br></p>



<p>As you are aware of the fact that there are a variety of automation tools available in the market, selecting the right one becomes a real challenge. Without the right automation tool, your automation efforts will be worthless and are bound to fail.</p>



<p>Lack of knowledge whether the tool is capable to meet the specific needs, lack of expertise to make the most of the automation tool, and tool costs exceeding the budget are some of the most common reasons for automation failure.<br></p>



<p>You can decide the best-suited one based on the nature and extent of your automation testing, whether the automation tool falls in your budget, and it matches your organization’s technical and business-related requirements.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>And just that is why we have also compiled a list that you can check before you choose a test automation tool specific to your needs: <a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/10-points-to-help-you-choose-the-right-test-automation-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Tips to choose the right tool for test automation.</a><br></p>



<p>These are some of the most common test automation challenges that QA teams face while tackling automation testing. If a team jumps into test automation without having a proper plan in place, there is a high chance that the automation journey will not be a smooth one.<br></p>



<p>Most of the QA teams face test automation challenges and failure to some extent. Start early, keep an eye for these top common test automation challenges and deal with them like a pro!<br></p>



<p>If you are looking for a one-stop test automation tool to speed up test case creation and execution, give <a href="https://testsigma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Testsigma</a> a try.

        <p>Published on: 2020-11-16</p>
        
<p>One opinion which I started questioning a lot in the last few years is educating people about encryption and providing easy access to end-to-end encrypted communication.</p>
<p>I find myself as one of the very few people in my entourage that half-believes in the necessity of policy initiatives for limiting access to end-to-end encryption, like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">the ones the EU is advancing</a>.</p>
<p>Take as an example a tool like <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>, end-to-end encrypted messaging, open-source, funded mainly by private individuals rather than by governments and/or corporations subservient to said governments.</p>
<p>Young me thought that the idea of something like Signal, a tool that can be used by anyone to essentially make all their communications private, was amazing. Still-young-but-somewhat-older me thinks that making sure apps like Signal are <em>not</em> accessible to a wide audience might actually be an ethical goal.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h2>I - Millions of LSD blotters, dozens of bombs</h2>
<p>To answer this question I think we first have to understand something curious about the real world. Namely the fact that, in the vast majority of Europe and the US, you can buy LSD.</p>
<p>It's not very complicated to do it either, you can order from markets like Agora (or whatever kids are using nowadays) and get it delivered at home, from a vendor that's been independently verified by multiple sources which sent it to trustworthy labs which generated COAs for the stuff.</p>
<p>You can also buy it on the street in most places, without having to look too hard. At most, you have to go to a festival, but in the more civilized parts of Europe and the US it's probably enough to ask your tolerated-drugs dealer and he'll know a guy.</p>
<p>This is extremely surprising considering the prerequisites of making LSD, namely having access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergotamine</li>
<li>Diethylamine</li>
<li>Lysergic acid</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are not the only things one needs, but they are the most likely to get you in trouble if you try acquiring them. Ergotamine is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_list_of_chemicals">list I controlled precursor</a>. Diethylamine is not controlled but is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_list_of_chemicals">DEA surveillance list</a> (i.e. if you buy a lot of it men with guns will come knocking at your door to ask questions) and I can't find the status of lysergic acid, but I assume its purchase is also monitored to some extent.</p>
<p>These substances are not easy to synthesize either, you can arguably make diethylamine fairly easily in a home lab. But, for ergotamine and lysergic acid, you basically need a large quantity of ergot and plants containing lysergamides. The latter might be easy to source, the former certainly isn't.</p>
<p>So an operation sourcing significant quantities of all of those 3, under the government radar, seems like a pretty complex business. It becomes even more complex once one considers <a href="https://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?domain=tk&amp;id=26">how LSD is made</a>. It's the kind of thing you <em>can</em> make in a "home lab" if that "home lab" is staffed by a group of skilled chemists and has very expensive equipment, it's not cooking meth.</p>
<p>The PiHKAL description above glances over steps that would require quite a bit of chemical engineering know-how to get right, e.g:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The residue was chromatographed over alumina with elution employing a 3:1 C6H6/CHCl3 mixture, and the collected fraction stripped of solvent under hard vacuum to a constant weight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>a lot</em> to unpack there, half a book could be written about each half of the above sentence, and it's one out of over a dozen detailing the process.</p>
<p>Granted, I assume that the recipe PiHKAL gives is not what people use on an industrial scale. But the point I'm trying to argue here is that making LSD is hard, it's a miracle we have so much of it.</p>
<p>All in all, one would need a fairly well-equipped laboratory, expensive enough to require selling millions of doses to get a good ROI. One would need a fairly sophisticated supply chain, requiring silent friends in a few key places and potentially some large ergot-producing wheat fields or greenhouses.</p>
<p>Yet LSD is priced at between 4 and 20$ for 100mcg depending on location. I'm not particularly surprised that the world has an ample supply of LSD, I'm just surprised that this is happening in the same world where, despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents">hundreds of terrorist attacks</a> in Europe in the last few years, not a single building was demolished using TNT, not a single major water supply was poisoned, nor a single mass gathering bombed with white phosphorus.</p>
<p>Consider what's needed to make TNT, the gist of it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>toluene (of course)</li>
<li>nitric acid</li>
<li>sulphuric acid</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, to put it in other words, to make a few kgs of TNT all one needs are common baking and cleaning products, toluene (available over the counter in reasonable quantities with no tracking), and some fertilizer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit here on my theoretical horse and claim I could do it in a few days, but it's orders of magnitudes easier than producing LSD. Both in terms of required know-how and in terms of how easy it is not to get caught.</p>
<p>Essentially, all a terrorist group would need to produce enough TNT to kill dozens of thousands of people, would be 4 or 5 blokes with some basic chemistry knowledge going to different shops to source the required reagents over time, plus the standard equipment one might find in a meth lab.</p>
<p>It's hard to find numbers on how much TNT one needs to destroy a skyscraper. I will consider that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_implosion">70kg of gunpowder</a> was enough for imploding a medium-sized cathedral in the 18th century. I'd wager 20-100kg of TNT, even in the hands of someone with no demolition know-how, could bring down enough building in a very violent way (note: Controlled demolition requires much more explosive than just making the building collapse).</p>
<p>It's a laughably easy problem, the fact that terrorist attacks are as low impact as they currently are is nothing but a testament to the utter stupidity of those engaging in them.</p>
<p>The thing I'm harping on about here is coordination! Sourcing and producing illegal chemical requires coordination for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pooling together money for the lab</li>
<li>Buying supplies in a way that allows one to stay under the radar</li>
<li>Distributing in a way that allows one to stay under the radar</li>
</ul>
<p>All those 3 coordination problems are much easier for someone wanting to murder thousands of people than for someone wanting to break down misconceptions about dualism with an HTP receptor agonist.</p>
<hr>
<p>So why are the "good guys" able to make industrial quantities of LSD while the religious fundamentalists can't coordinate enough to make a tiny bit of TNT?</p>
<p>Well, encryption is a large part of the problem, or rather, of the fortunate solution we've stumbled into. Somehow the "good guys" are able to use it while the fundamentalists aren't.</p>
<p>This is not only limited to making bombs, coordination problems appear in a lot of areas. For example, the terrorists trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_plot">kidnap and murder the governer Michigan</a> were foiled because they used insecure communication methods.</p>
<h2>II - Education and ill intentions</h2>
<p><strong>Note: Kinda talking around religious fundamentalists and other authoritarian ideologies here for the sake of brevity. There's plenty of other good resources around those debates though.</strong></p>
<p>The world we live in contains fairly nasty people, maybe nasty is the wrong word, a better way to phrase it is people that are bought up in systems that instill them with a harmful attitude towards others. People which view materialism as a zero-sum game and arbitrary violence as an acceptable means of spreading an ideology.</p>
<p>Just to put this in perspective, let me quote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_toward_terrorism">poll of Muslims living in France</a> (from wiki) regarding "suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian targets to defend Islam":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>64% of Muslims in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> believed it could never be justified, 19% believed it could be justified rarely, 16% thought it could be justified often or sometimes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, at least around 2% of the people of France are sometimes pro the idea of murdering innocents for the sake of the Islamic faith (e.g. using TNT, to demolish a building).</p>
<p>Now, back to the whole drug thing, <a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/drug-reports/2019/france/drug-use_en">1.3% of French people used</a> MDMA in the previous years based on surveys done during (as far as I understand) multiple years. I can't find numbers on psychedelic usage (i.e. non MDMA psychedelics), but I think it's reasonable to assume it's lower, e.g. ~1%.</p>
<p>So at any given time, France, one of the most secular and liberal countries in the whole world, has twice as many people that want the mass murder of innocents to advance and/or protect their fundamentalist religion, as it has people that want to buy LSD.</p>
<p>Yet somehow France has LSD, but no TNT-fueled mass murders. This is staggering, a blow to the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be more correct to make the association between people that bought LSD and people that donated money to a terrorist organization. But the statistics for that are (obviously) unavailable. Even so, maybe the numbers would drop to 0.2% vs 1% instead of 2% vs 1%, but the similarity of the scale still remains.</p>
<p>I think this boils down to the kind of people that use psychedelics versus the kind of people that want to see others murdered for a perceived slight to their culture. The difference in education level between the two demographics is probably fairly staggering.</p>
<p>Staggering enough that, even though encryption is free and open source for everyone to use, the religious fundamentalists lack even the vocabulary to understand it, while the necessity of it's usage and the way to do so might seem obvious to many psychedelic enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This propagates all the way up the chain. People donating to terrorist organizations probably doing so via unsafe channels, while people buying acid are doing it via safe~ish channels (e.g. calling the local imam via phone vs messaging your dealer via a telegram secret chat). People plotting terrorist attacks doing so via Facebook messenger or in a monitorable building, people producing LSD doing all in-person communications in secure locations and coordinating online via emails sent through TOR using quantum-safe encryption for the …</p></div></div>

											<h2>A Step-by-Step Tutorial for Developing Data Parallel C++ Kernels</h2>
					
											
					
					


<!-- Ratings Modal -->


					
											<p><em>[Editor’s note: This tutorial was adapted from</em> <strong><a href="https://github.com/jeffhammond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff’s GitHub repository</a></strong><em>.]</em></p>
<p>This is an introduction to the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Data Parallel C++</strong></a> programming model, or DPC++ for short. DPC++ is based on Khronos SYCL, which means it’s a modern C++ parallel programming model. SYCL 1.2.1 is the latest Khronos standard, although the SYCL 2020 provisional specific is available for review. Intel and other members of the SYCL working group are finalizing the next version of the language specification. DPC++ contains extensions that make SYCL easier to use, although many of these are expected to be part of SYCL 2020. Implementing extensions in the DPC++ compiler helps the community evaluate their effectiveness before standardization.</p>
<h2>Who Is This Tutorial For?</h2>
<p>This tutorial is for programmers who already have a decent understanding of C++ and parallelism. Teaching C++ and parallelism is hard—and there’s a lot of material out there already. There’s far less information on SYCL itself, and even less about DPC++, so that’s our focus.</p>
<p>SYCL is derived from OpenCL, and the execution models are quite similar. If you need help understanding the SYCL/OpenCL execution model, please check out <a href="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2012-pan-pacific-road-show-June/OpenCL-Details-Taiwan_June-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>this overview</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Who Is This Tutorial <em>Not</em> For?</h2>
<p>When I tell people about SYCL, I often say, “If you like modern C++, you’ll like SYCL because it’s definitely modern C++.” A corollary to this is that if you hate C++, you’ll hate SYCL and DPC++. So, if you don’t want to write modern C++, this tutorial is not for you.</p>
<p>OpenMP 5.0 offers many of the same features as SYCL/DPC++ but supports the ISO language triumvirate of C++, C, and Fortran. If you want to program CPUs and GPUs using Fortran, C, or pre-modern C++ (i.e., before C++11) using an open industry standard, try OpenMP.</p>
<p>Another alternative to SYCL/DPC++ without the C++ is OpenCL. OpenCL is a lot more verbose than SYCL, but if you’re a C programmer, you likely prefer explicit control to syntactic efficiency.</p>
<h2>The Tutorial</h2>
<p>We’ll start with vector addition, which is the “Hello, world!” of HPC and numerical computation. Printing “Hello, world!” doesn’t make a lot of sense in a programming model used for doing lots of things in parallel.</p>
<h2>Vector Addition in SYCL</h2>
<p>The operation we’re trying to implement is SAXPY, which stands for Single-precision A times X plus Y which can be implemented in C or C++ as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6.jpg" alt="" width="1134" height="158" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6.jpg 1134w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-300x42.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-1024x143.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-1-6-768x107.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1134px) 100vw, 1134px"></p>
<p>There are lots of ways to write this in C++. For example, we could use ranges, which would make the code look a bit more like the upcoming SYCL version. But teaching you every possible way to write a loop in C++ isn’t the point of this tutorial, and everybody understands the version that looks like C.</p>
<p>Here’s the same loop in SYCL. There’s a lot to unpack here, so we’ll break down in pieces:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="177" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6.jpg 1152w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-300x46.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-1024x157.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-2-6-768x118.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, <span>parallel_for</span> is a parallel for-loop. The loop body is expressed as a lambda. The lambda is the code that looks like [..]{..}.</p>
<p>The loop iterator is expressed in terms of a <span>sycl::range</span> and a <span>sycl::id</span>. In our simple example, both are one-dimension, as indicated by the <span>&lt;1&gt;</span>. SYCL ranges and ids can be one-, two-, or three-dimensional. (OpenCL and CUDA have the same limitation.)</p>
<p>It may be a bit unfamiliar to write loops like this, but it’s consistent with how lambdas work. However, if you’ve ever used <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDPL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>parallel STL</strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TBB</strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kokkos</strong></a>, or <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RAJA</strong></a>, you’ll recognize the pattern.</p>
<p>You might be wondering about the <span>&lt;class saxpy&gt;</span> template argument to <span>parallel_for</span>. This is just a way to name the kernel, which is necessary because you might want to use SYCL with a different host C++ compiler than the SYCL device compiler. In this case, the two compilers need a way to agree on the kernel name. In many SYCL compilers, such as Intel DPC++, this isn’t necessary. And we can tell the compiler to not worry about looking for names by using the option <span>-fsycl-unnamed-lambda</span>.</p>
<p>We won’t try to explain what the <span>h</span> in <span>h.parallel_for</span> is right now. We’ll cover that later.</p>
<h2>SYCL Queues</h2>
<p>One challenge of heterogeneous programming is the multiple types of processing elements and, often, different memory types. These things make compilers and runtimes more complicated. The SYCL programming model embraces heterogeneous execution, although at a much higher level than OpenCL. Not everything is explicit, either. Unlike other popular GPU programming models, SYCL kernels can be inlined into the host program flow, which improves readability.</p>
<p>Whenever we want to compute on a device, we need to create a work queue:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6.jpg" alt="" width="1186" height="102" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6.jpg 1186w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-300x26.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-1024x88.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-3-6-768x66.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1186px) 100vw, 1186px"></p>
<p>The default selector favors a GPU, if present, and a CPU otherwise. We can create queues associated with specific device types using this:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6.jpg" alt="" width="1168" height="154" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6.jpg 1168w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-300x40.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-1024x135.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-4-6-768x101.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></p>
<p>The host and CPU selectors may lead to significantly different results, even though they target the same hardware, because the host selector might use a sequential implementation optimized for debugging, while the CPU selector uses the OpenCL runtime and runs across all the cores. Also, the OpenCL just-in-time (JIT) compiler might generate different code because it’s using a different compiler altogether. Don’t assume that just because the host is a CPU, that host and CPU mean the same thing in SYCL.</p>
<h2>Managing Data in SYCL Using Buffers</h2>
<p>The canonical way to manage data in SYCL is with buffers. A SYCL buffer is an opaque container. This is an elegant design, but some applications would like pointers, which are provided by the USM extension, discussed later.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2.jpg" alt="" width="1147" height="177" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2.jpg 1147w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-300x46.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-1024x158.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-13-2-768x119.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1147px) 100vw, 1147px"></p>
<p>In the previous example, the user allocates a C++ container on the host and then hands it over to SYCL. Until the destructor of the SYCL buffer is invoked, the user can’t access the data through a non-SYCL mechanism. SYCL accessors are the important aspect of SYCL data management with buffers, which we’ll explain below.</p>
<h2>Controlling Device Execution</h2>
<p>Because device code may require a different compiler or code generation mechanism from the host, it’s necessary to clearly identify sections of device code. Below we see how this looks in SYCL 1.2.1. We use the <span>submit</span> method to enqueue work to the device queue, <span>q</span>. This method returns an opaque handler against which we execute kernels, in this case via <span>parallel_for</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4.jpg" alt="" width="1172" height="261" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4.jpg 1172w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-300x67.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-6-4-768x171.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px"></p>
<p>We can synchronize device execution using the <span>wait()</span> method. There are finer-grain methods for synchronizing device execution, but we start with simplest one, which is a heavy hammer.</p>
<p>Some users may find the above code a bit verbose, particularly compared to models like Kokkos. The Intel DPC++ compiler supports a terse syntax, which we’ll cover below.</p>
<h2>Compute Kernels and Buffers</h2>
<p>SYCL accessors are the final piece in our first SYCL program. Accessors may be unfamiliar to GPU programmers, but they have a number of nice properties compared to other methods. While SYCL allows the programmer to move data explicitly using, for example, the <span>copy()</span> method, the accessor methods don’t require this because they generate a dataflow graph that the compiler and runtime can use to move data at the right time. This is particularly effective when multiple kernels are invoked in sequence. In this case, the SYCL implementation will deduce that data is reused and not copy it back to the host unnecessarily. Also, we can schedule data movement asynchronously (i.e., overlapped with device execution). While expert GPU programmers can do this manually, we often find that SYCL accessors lead to better performance than OpenCL programs where programmers must move data explicitly.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2.jpg" alt="" width="1190" height="353" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2.jpg 1190w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-300x89.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-1024x304.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-7-2-768x228.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px"></p>
<p>Because programming models that assume pointers are handles to memory have a hard time with SYCL accessors, the USM extension makes accessors unnecessary. USM places a greater burden on the programmer in terms of data movement and synchronization but helps with compatibility in legacy code that wants to use pointers.</p>
<h2>Review of Our First SYCL Program</h2>
<p>Here are all the components of our SYCL SAXPY program we just described:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="631" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1.jpg 888w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-8-1-768x546.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></p>
<p>The full source code for this example is available in the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/jeffhammond/dpcpp-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://github.com/jeffhammond/dpcpp-tutorial</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>SYCL 2020 Unified Shared Memory (USM)</h2>
<p>While the program above is perfectly functional and can be implemented across a wide range of platforms, some users will find it rather verbose. Furthermore, it’s not compatible with libraries and frameworks that need to manage memory using pointers. To address this issue with SYCL 1.2.1, Intel developed an extension in DPC++ called Unified Shared Memory (USM) that supports pointer-based memory management.</p>
<p>USM supports two important usage models, both of which will be illustrated below. The first one supports automatic data movement between the host and device. The second one is for explicit data movement to and from device allocations.</p>
<p>The details are in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification, but to get started, all you need to know is below. The <span>q</span> argument is the queue associated with the device where the allocated data will live (either permanently or temporarily):</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1.jpg" alt="" width="1168" height="311" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1.jpg 1168w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-300x80.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-1024x273.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/code-9-1-768x204.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px"></p>
<p>If we’re using device allocation, data must be moved explicitly (e.g., using the SYCL <span>memcpy</span> method), which behaves the same way <span>std::memcpy</span> does (e.g., the destination is on the left):</p>

<p>If we use USM, accessors are no longer required, which means we can simplify the kernel code above to:</p>

<p>You can find the complete working examples of both versions of USM in this repo, named <span>saxpy-usm.cc</span> and <span>saxpy-usm2.cc</span>, respectively.</p>
<h2>SYCL 2020 Terse Syntax</h2>
<p>Finally, in case you’ve been wondering why the opaque handler <span>h</span> was required in each of these programs, it turns out that it isn’t required after all. The following is an equivalent implementation, which was added in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification. Furthermore, we can take advantage of lambda names being optional in the SYCL 2020 provisional specification. Together, these two small changes make SYCL kernels the same length as the original C++ loop listed at the beginning of this tutorial:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>tldr: it’s back now!</p>



<p>At 00:42 in the early morning of November 16 (my time, Central European Time), I received an email saying that “someone” logged into my twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a> from a new device. The email said it was done from Stockholm, Sweden and it was “Chrome on Windows”. (I live Stockholm)</p>



<p>I didn’t do it. I don’t normally use Windows and I typically don’t run Chrome. I didn’t react immediately on the email however, as I was debugging curl code at the moment it arrived. Just a few moments later I was forcibly logged out from my twitter sessions (using tweetdeck in my Firefox on Linux and on my phone).</p>



<p>Whoa! What was that? I tried to login again in the browser tab, but Twitter claimed my password was invalid. Huh? Did I perhaps have the wrong password? I selected “restore my password” and then learned that Twitter doesn’t even know about my email anymore (in spite of having emailed me on it just minutes ago).</p>



<p>At 00:50 I reported the issue to Twitter. At 00:51 I replied to their confirmation email and provided them with additional information, such as my phone number I have (had?) associated with my account.</p>



<p>I’ve since followed up with two additional emails to Twitter with further details about this but I have yet to hear something from them. I cannot access my account.</p>



<p><strong>November 17</strong>: (30 hours since it happened). The name of my account changed to Elon Musk (with a few funny unicode letters that only look similar to the Latin letters) and pushed for bitcoin scams.</p>



<p>Also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25120918">mentioned on hacker news</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jvor6q/daniel_stenbergs_curl_twitter_account_compromised/">reddit</a>.</p>



<p>At 20:56 on November 17 I received the email with the notice the account had been restored back to my email address and ownership.</p>



<p>Left now are the very sad DM responses in my account from desperate and ruined people who cry out for help and mercy from the scammers after they’ve fallen for the scam and lost large sums of money.</p>



<h2>How?</h2>



<p>A lot of people ask me how this was done. The simple answer is that I don’t know. At. All. Maybe I will later on but right now, it all went down as described above and it does not tell how the attacker managed to perform this. Maybe I messed up somewhere? I don’t know and I refuse to speculate without having more information.</p>



<p>I’m convinced I had 2fa enabled on the account, but I’m starting to doubt if perhaps I am mistaking myself?</p>



<h2>Why me?</h2>



<p>Probably because I have a “verified” account (with a blue check-mark) with almost 24.000 followers.</p>



<h2>Other accounts</h2>



<p>I have not found any attacks, take-overs or breaches in any other online accounts and I have no traces of anyone attacking my local computer or other accounts of mine with value. I don’t see any reason to be alarmed to suspect that source code or github project I’m involved with should be “in danger”.</p>

<h4>A dive into using Differential Datalog</h4>
<p><span>Published 2020-11-13
| 11 Minutes Long
| 2011 Words
</span></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> is a declarative programming language. For those who don't know,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative language</a> is a language that
"expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow". That's a bit daunting of a definition,
so I prefer to say it's defining <em>what</em> a program does instead of <em>how</em> it does it. In "normal" languages (imperative,
functional, etc) you give the computer a sequence of instructions to follow, the standard "if this, then that" we're
all so familiar with. This leads to a relatively lower-level program, as we're telling the computer exactly what it
should do at any time. The underlying language may take liberties with how this plays out, but in the end it's doing
what you told it to. Contrasting this, the actual how's of a declarative program's execution is left entirely up to
the implementation, all you give it is the lose framework of what you want to happen and it fills in the gaps.
<a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog">Differential Datalog</a> (also known as DDlog) is one such
implementation, with the notable difference from other datalog flavors that it compiles to
<a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a>, a data-parallel framework for
processing large amounts of data incrementally (See <a href="https://timelydataflow.github.io/timely-dataflow/"><code>timely</code></a> and <a href="https://timelydataflow.github.io/differential-dataflow/"><code>differential-dataflow</code></a>'s documentation for more in-depth
information on that side of things).</p>
<p>That's a bit to wrap your head around, so lets look at a small example. Here's the setup: we have a list of graph edges
and we want to find all paths through the graph. Here's the code:</p>
<pre><span>input relation Edge(x: u32, y: u32)

output relation Path(x: u32, y: u32)
Path(x, y) :- Edge(x, y).
Path(x, y) :- Edge(x, z), Path(z, y).
</span></pre>
<p>To people who know with languages like Prolog, this probably looks really familiar since graphs are a place
where declarative languages <em>really</em> shine. However, to those of us who have never used a logic language
this looks daunting, so let's break it down piece by piece</p>
<pre><span>input relation Edge(x: u32, y: u32)
</span></pre>
<p>This is our (aptly named) input relation, it's what is fed into the program by the user. Users interact with ddlog
programs through a series <code>insert</code>/<code>update</code>/<code>delete</code>/<code>modify</code> instructions that are very reminiscent of database
directives. For this input relation in particular, we've given it the name <code>Edge</code> and it contains two fields:
<code>x</code> which holds an unsigned 32bit integer and <code>y</code> which also holds an unsigned 32bit integer. Let's use this as
our graph program's input (written in ddlog's <a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/command_reference/command_reference.md#ddlog-command-language">dat</a> format)</p>
<pre><span>insert Edge(4, 6),
insert Edge(6, 5),
insert Edge(4, 5),
insert Edge(5, 3),
insert Edge(3, 4).
</span></pre>
<p>This maps out to a very simple little graph</p>
<p><img src="https://chasewilson.dev/blog/intro-to-ddlog/graph1.png" alt="Simple Graph"></p>
<p>Next up we have an output relation named <code>Path</code></p>
<pre><span>output relation Path(x: u32, y: u32)
</span></pre>
<p>Output relations are how ddlog communicates with the outside world, they're automatically (and incrementally)
updated when facts they depend on change. What's a fact? Well, I'm glad you asked! The bulk of ddlog programs
are made up of <em>facts</em> and <em>rules</em> (referred to collectively as a <em>clause</em>). A fact is just that, it's a truth
(within the context of the program, I'll get into that later) that has been derived from the given rules</p>
<pre><span>Path(x, y) :- Edge(x, y).
^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^
  fact          rule
</span></pre>
<p>In layman's terms this clause is saying "for every <code>Edge</code> with an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code>, create a <code>Path</code> with that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>"
and it does exactly that, looking at the contents of the <code>Path</code> relation shows us an identical copy of what we gave it
as input</p>
<pre><span>Path(4, 6).
Path(6, 5).
Path(4, 5).
Path(5, 3).
Path(3, 4).
</span></pre>
<p>Then comes the second rule, and this is where ddlog throws us a curve ball. This isn't a normal rule, this is a
<a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#recursive-rules">recursive rule</a></p>
<pre><span>Path(x, y) :- Edge(x, z), Path(z, y).
</span></pre>
<p>Before I explain what's going on here, there's a few new things going on that I want to point out. First is a new piece
of syntax, the comma between <code>Edge(x, z)</code> and <code>Path(z, y)</code>. This is a logical <code>AND</code> of sorts, each successive rule applies
filters to the ones before it. The second thing is that both the <code>Edge</code> rule and the <code>Path</code> rule have a <code>z</code> field, which
looks kinda weird at first glance. What this is doing is first declaring <code>z</code> as the second field of the <code>Edge</code> relation
and then only selecting the values from <code>Path</code> where its first field is the <em>same</em> as the <code>z</code> from the <code>Edge</code>. Breaking
back down into english, this clause is saying "for every <code>Edge</code> with an <code>x</code> and <code>z</code>, select every <code>Path</code> where <code>Path.x</code>
is equal to <code>z</code> and take its <code>y</code>, then create a <code>Path</code> with the <code>x</code> from <code>Edge</code> and the <code>y</code> from <code>Path</code>". The really neat
thing about recursive rules is that they will efficiently recurse to completion since every time a new <code>Path</code> is added,
more possible paths open up that need to be computed.</p>
<p>I didn't mention this earlier, but vanilla Datalog is quite boring. It's not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing complete</a>
and it lacks a lot of the more creature comforts of programming as well as vital things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog#Fragments">like negation</a>.
Normal Datalog is also untyped, which is a huge detriment to larger programs. DDlog solves both of these problems (and more)
by allowing your ddlog programs to incorporate user-defined types, enums and functions. This makes programming in ddlog a lot
more comfortable than a pure logic-based language, as well as more familiar.</p>
<p>To get a little more familiar with ddlog, let's make a little program to grade students based off of their test scores.
Our inputs will be the students who will each have a name (which we'll assume is unique) and a series of grades, each
connected to a student by name with the score they got on it. If a student has no test scores, they don't have a grade
in the class. Translated to ddlog we'd create these input relations and the corresponding output relation</p>
<pre><span>input relation Student(name: string)
input relation Test(student: string, score: float)

output relation Grades(student: string, score: Option&lt;float&gt;)
</span></pre>
<p>First things first, what's that <code>Option&lt;float&gt;</code>? Well, this is one of those enums I mentioned (which also takes a generic value).
<code>Option</code> is declared in <a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/blob/master/lib/ddlog_std.dl">ddlog's standard library</a>
and it looks like this</p>
<pre><span>typedef Option&lt;'A&gt; =
    None
    | Some { x: 'A }
</span></pre>
<p>If you're familiar with a functional language like ML or Haskell, this looks pretty familar. This is declaring the type <code>Option</code>
with the generic parameter <code>'A</code> which has the <code>None</code> variant and the <code>Some</code> variant where the <code>Some</code> variant contains an instance
of the generic <code>'A</code>. This is exactly the same as Rust's <code>Option</code> or Haskell's <code>Maybe</code>, it's either <em>something</em> or <em>nothing</em>.
As a quick side note since I couldn't figure out how to shoehorn it into this example, the syntax for defining ddlog structs
is very similar, we'll make a more complex <code>Test</code> just to show it off</p>
<pre><span>typedef Test = Test {
    student: string,
    possible_points: float,
    earned_points: float,
    curve_percentile: float,
}
</span></pre>
<p>That defines the <code>Test</code> struct with the <code>student</code>, <code>possible_points</code>, etc. fields. Structs can also have generics, the syntax
is the same as with enums. With that out of the way, we're going to find all the students who have no test grades so we
can give them no grade</p>
<pre><span>Grades(student, None) :-
    Student(student),
    not Test(student, _).
</span></pre>
<p>What we're doing here is saying that for each student in the <code>Student</code> relation who has no test grades, their grade is <code>None</code>.
This uses <a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#negations-and-antijoins">negation</a>,
another feature not part of standard datalog.</p>
<p>From there, calculating averages is pretty simple when you use the <a href="https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/blob/master/doc/tutorial/tutorial.md#grouping"><code>.group_by()</code> operator</a></p>
<pre><span>Grades(student, Some { score }) :-
    Student(student),
    Test(student, test),
    var test_scores = test.group_by(student),
    var score = test_scores.average().
</span></pre>
<p>Woah, that gave us a <em>lot</em> of new stuff all at the same time, so let's take it piece by piece. First off we have <code>Some { score }</code>.
This is pattern matching, and is just a nice way of wrapping the <code>score</code> we get from the rules of the clause into an <code>Option</code>
package. Next up is <code>var test_scores = test.group_by(student)</code>, our group_by clause I talked about earlier. What this does is
<em>group</em> each <code>test</code> by the given <code>student</code>. This will yield a <code>Group&lt;string, float&gt;</code> (defined in the ddlog std) which I'll address
later that we then store into the <code>test_scores</code> variable that we declare with <code>var test_scores =</code>. Lastly we have
<code>var score = test_scores.average()</code> which calls the <code>.average()</code> function on the <code>test_scores</code> variable before storing it into
<code>score</code>.</p>
<p>What is this <code>.average()</code> function we just called, and where did it come from? Well, we actually declared it ourselves! It's a
pretty standard function for finding the average of a bunch of float values, here's the code</p>
<pre><span>function average(scores: Group&lt;string, float&gt;): float {
    // Sum up the test scores, then divide that by the number
    // of test scores we got
    scores.group_sum() / scores.count() as float
}
</span></pre>
<p>This defines the function <code>average</code> which takes in a <code>Group</code> of strings and floats and returns one single float, pretty simple.
"Hold up a moment", I hear some of you saying "that declares a <em>free</em> function, but you called it like a method, that can't
be right!". Well fear not reader, because ddlog has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax">universal function call syntax</a> which is a big and fancy name for "you can call free functions using method syntax". This means
both <code>test_scores.average()</code> and <code>average(test_scores)</code> are equally valid, so what you choose to use is entirely up to
what you feel more comfortable with.</p>

output relation Grades(student: string, score: Option&lt;float&gt;)
Grades(student, None) :- Student(student), not Test(student, _).
Grades(student, Some { score }) :-
    Student(student),
    Test(student, test),
    var test_scores = test.group_by(student),

<p>Now that we know <em>about</em> ddlog, lets see what's working behind it. DDlog compiles to
<a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a>
in the form of native Rust code. So, what's so special about dataflow that makes it so well
suited for ddlog, and why should you …</p></div></div></div>

We expect at least 20 more COSS IPOs by the year 2030, in addition to the 16 that have already gone public. </em></blockquote><p>Why do we believe this?

        <div id="post-body"><p>Last Friday, Apple released <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/">Big Sur,</a> the latest version of macOS. While everyone else was busy downloading GBs of data from Apple’s servers, I took a different, less beaten path. Meet my new best friend, Ubuntu:</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 600w, https://preslav.me/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1000w, https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/11/00D3D9EE-B924-4C9D-9F81-0F7238C77DFD.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Those who follow this blog would recall that I have been <a href="https://preslav.me/2020/08/02/in-search-of-a-new-laptop/">looking for</a> an alternative to an Apple-dominated ecosystem for quite some time. While I tried different laptops, I never really got the same feeling of attachment that I have to my model 2015 MacBook Pro. It turns out, I like and respect older Apple hardware. There are tons of it out there, still in perfect working condition, waiting to be repurposed and made usable again. Yet, every newer generation of macOS would offer less and less of its capabilities. Sometimes, even intentionally hampering what one could tinker around within the name of “safety and integrity protection”.</p><p>In my view, 2015 was the last year any robust and sustainable laptops came out of there. You don’t have to agree with me.</p><p>So, I ran around looking for other options. An obvious choice would have been running Windows 10 on Bootcamp and trying to get my Linux experience with the WSL2. I am sure that it would have worked fine. But again, we are speaking about slightly older hardware here that we still want to use for writing software. Running Linux inside a VM, even as lightweight as the WSL2 was not an option, I’d be happy with. There was only one other option to get the Linux experience I wanted …</p><h2 id="running-linux-on-a-mac-does-that-even-work">Running Linux on a Mac? Does that even work?</h2><p>It does better than I and probably many of you would have expected. Both visually and under the hood, I am getting more out of the hardware than Catalina (ugh), or possibly, Big Sur would have managed to squeeze. If you use apps that have support or alternatives on other platforms and choose to go for a no-brainer distribution like Ubuntu, you won’t feel a difference in your end experience at all. Ubuntu’s default GUI is modern and snappy. Some even claim that Big Sur looks a lot more like Gnome or KDE than any previous version of macOS. Of course, Linux being open, if the default environment feels heavy for your hardware, one can always choose one from the myriads of other GUI options available on the Linux Universe.</p><h2 id="what-about-the-installation-process">What about the installation process?</h2><p>In my case, the installation was super smooth as well. I baked an Ubuntu image on a Micro SD card (works too, if you don’t have a USB stick) using <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a>. Before the installation, one has the option to try Ubuntu live by directly booting off the Micro SD (or USB stick). Simply,press Alt during boot, wait a few seconds and choose “EFI Boot” from the available options. I highly recommend to anyone to spend as much time as possible playing around before installing. I had written down a huge checklist of things I wanted to make sure I check before I even go and prepare my SSD for the installation. Make sure you have tested your WiFi, sound, Bluetooth, etc. I was lucky enough that my WiFi worked out of the box, but this might not be the case with other Macs. A working Internet connection is very important during the installation, so if your WiFi doesn’t happen to work, make sure you grab an Ethernet cable (and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if necessary) before you move on.</p><p>I will be brief about the rest of the process since everything is explained in detail in the guide I followed:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">How to install Linux on a Macintosh and dual boot with macOS</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><br>If you only have 256 GB SSD or less and want to keep your existing macOS available, be prepared for a lot of space freeing and partitioning your drive. I freed up 100 GB for Ubuntu and left some 4 GB for a swap partition. I intend to be able to reduce my macOS partition even further, eventually increasing the size of my Linux storage.</p><p>Once partitions were in place, installation and booting from Linux were no problem at all. In case they happen to be, the guide above explains how to set up a more advanced boot loader.</p><h2 id="what-i-am-still-struggling-with">What I am still struggling with</h2><p>Surprisingly little. Bigger things are the sound coming out of the audio jack (though speakers work perfectly), and maintaining proper scaling across my laptop’s screen and my external monitor. The latter one is more of a general issue on pretty much all OSes. I was positively surprised that Ubuntu picked up the native resolutions of both displays, so my picture was crystal sharp, albeit very small,and required adjusting some scaling. More minor issues include not being able to scroll with my Magic Mouse, and of course, having to learn to use Ctrl instead of Cmd for pretty much all things. I am sure though that given time, I will find appropriate solutions for all those things. None of them bothers me nearly enough to make me switch back.</p><p>I will try to report more on my experience after some time has passed. For now, I am more than happy.</p></div>

And as Deibert explains in his fourth Massey Lecture, a lot has changed in the years following the social media uprising.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5797286.1605041141!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/egypt-tahrir-antiquities.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Anti-government protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, February 2011.

Unfortunately, it wasn't just political underdogs and freedom fighters who recognized the immense power of these revolutionary new tools.</p>  <p>The great lesson of the Arab Spring, says John Naughton, a professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University in the U.K., "is that autocrats actually are better at using this allegedly democratizing technology than democratic regimes."</p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="I was the target of an international mercenary spy operation" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1818831427614-metadata-" title="I was the target of an international mercenary spy operation"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/941/839/THTM5_Ep2_JSR_Still002.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>When John Scott-Railton, a researcher at Citizen Lab, was contacted by someone claiming to be interested in his work, he was immediately suspicious. He decided to play along and found himself in a game of spy versus spy.<!-- --> <!-- -->7:59</span></span></span></p>  <p>Naughton, author of <em>From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet</em>, explains that the same technologies that had been used for public uprisings against oppressive governments are now being used by those governments against political&nbsp;demonstrators, whistleblowers and dissidents.</p>  <p>"In that sense," Naughton says, "the technology has turned on us. We thought that it was always going to be liberating and democratizing. And sometimes, it's actually enslaving."</p>  <h2>Big Brother territory&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Nearly a decade after what had been called "Twitter revolution," we find ourselves in Big Brother territory, says Glenny, remarking at the extraordinary speed with which <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/actually-most-countries-are-increasingly-spying-on-their-citizens-the-un-says/276614/" target="_blank">intelligence agencies and militaries in particular have appropriated these tools</a>. "Now most countries are using data from their citizens to monitor, to see what they're up to."</p>    <p>While such Orwellian envisioning was long seen as futuristic, "we're now moving into a technological environment where the complete surveillance of all citizens, of all populace, of all people, and of all things is increasingly possible," says Daniel Deudney, a professor of political science and international relations at Johns Hopkins University.</p>  <p>So how did it come to be it that the very tools meant to empower individuals were so swiftly seized by the powers that sought to maintain control?</p>  <p>It did not take long for authoritarian regimes and security agencies "to realize just how useful it is to have their adversaries plugged in, networked, and online communicating," says Deibert.</p>  <p>As he explains, the technologies used to organize grassroots uprisings, such as smartphones and social media platforms — consumer products made by technology companies for whom security is often an afterthought — just served to supercharge "the dictator's totalizing gaze and iron grip," which have now become borderless as well.</p>    <p>Government agencies can now easily keep tabs on individuals, no matter where they are. They can ascertain who their friends and family members are, track their movements, and see their plans unfold in real time, "from the very device they hold in their hands, and that they carry with them as they go about their daily business," explains Deibert.</p>  <p>Saudi Arabia, for example, "has aggressively pursued extensive social media manipulation, digital subversion, and cyber-espionage," he says. And while some of it has been directed at regional rivals, "the bulk of it is intended to thwart political opposition and dissent," ranging from political opposition, to criticism of the crown prince, to the assertion of women's rights.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/1052814206.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/1052814206.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/1052814206.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/1052814206.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/1052814206.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5234101.1597455666!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/1052814206.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The government of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seen here in 2018, has been accused of using social media manipulation and cyber-espionage to 'thwart political opposition and dissent,' says Deibert.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Fayez Nureldine/AFP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The troubling irony is that while we may perceive our devices and social media accounts as our windows to the world, says Deibert, "the flow of communications over the internet works in both directions." Indeed, those devices and accounts are also a window into our lives for those on the outside looking in.</p>  <p>"Far from being the existential threat that many observers of the Arab Spring assumed, social media have turned out to be a dictator's best friend," says Deibert.</p>  <h2>From authoritarian regimes to established&nbsp;democracies</h2>  <p>Perhaps more disturbing yet is the fact that these tactics are being used not only to monitor dissidents, but to keep entire societies in check. In China, "information controls have evolved far beyond mere defensive measures to more proactive uses of social media for large-scale social and economic engineering," says Deibert.</p>  <p>The so-called "social credit system" is an all-encompassing initiative to draw on data from across the internet, as well as information captured by an estimated 200 million cameras across the country, to track and evaluate individuals for their "trustworthiness" and root out "uncivilized behaviour," which Deibert notes, includes wearing pyjamas in public or jaywalking.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/china-uighur-protest.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/china-uighur-protest.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/china-uighur-protest.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-uighur-protest.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/china-uighur-protest.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4778165.1533759023!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-uighur-protest.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Activists around the world have held demonstrations protesting China's use of artificial intelligence and data collection to implement a social credit system.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Seth Wenig/Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"High-resolution digital surveillance cameras are omnipresent, scattered throughout our cities," says Deibert, and "layered underneath those fixed cameras are the billions of consumer devices that nearly everyone carries with them at all times, the standard features of which include a built-in digital camera. Multiplying the effects is a widespread 'selfie' culture of auto-surveillance, in which digital images of people's faces are frequently snapped and then shared on social media platforms with a mere click."</p>  <p>As the images are digitized, they can be easily converted into a matrix of data points that algorithms and artificial intelligence systems can sift through and sort. Tools that harness this unprecedented collection of biometric data are already available, and have, as<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html"> journalist Kashmir Hill noted in the New York Times</a>, the power to "end privacy as we know it."&nbsp;</p>  <p>While China and Saudi Arabia are notable examples of how new technologies are enabling "digital authoritarianism" to flourish, Deibert warns, "it would be a mistake to conclude that the effects of social media are limited to a group of bad actors 'over there.'" Indeed, some have argued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/opinion/trump-russia-election-interference.html">the greatest threat to the recent U.S. election was not Russian interference</a>, but came from within the White House.

(On a scale from most free to least free, Canada was right at the top — above the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and Germany&nbsp;—&nbsp;with freedom of the press, and no blocking of social media and political content.)</p>  <h2>A turning point</h2>  <p>We are at a juncture, a turning point, and the fundamental question now, says Daniel Deudney, is: who is going to have access to these massive amounts information and for what purposes?</p>  <p>"We have to be very sober about this. This is a technology that may be much better for empowering the adversaries of liberal democracy than for empowering liberal democracy. At a minimum, it's going to be necessary for liberal democracy to step up and come up with a regime for the use of this technology in ways that are compatible with its fundamental principles. And if we can't do that, we have to realistically expect liberal democracy to wither away, to dissolve away."</p>  <p>Deibert concludes that, "there is no jurisdiction that is immune to corruption and authoritarian practices — only greater or lesser degrees of …</p></span></p></div></div>

</header>
<p>In this article we are going to talk continuous testing and packaging in Common Lisp. The goal is to automate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Report coding errors on every push, including pull requests. This prevents unseen, long-standing breakages, and also helps with pull requests since the system will automatically report failing tests, compilation warnings, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease the release process by automating package builds. This allows us to release often with a higher level of guarantees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since Nyxt is currently hosted on GitHub, we are leveraging GitHub Actions for our continuous integration. Even though we are using GitHub Actions, we've designed our process to be platform independent. As a result, our GitHub-specific code remains small and trivial.</p>

<p>Some Common Lisp compilers are particularly good at code analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No false positives, all warnings are meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>They catch many errors at compile time, including typing errors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> and <a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/">CCL</a> are two high-quality compilers that fit the bill. While only SBCL is officially supported to build Nyxt, CCL proves useful in catching some error and warning classes that SBCL misses. In particular, CCL is better at type-checking class slots.</p>
<p>Let's review what we want to automate to increase our quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build: The project compiles with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing: All test suites pass with all compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Code checking: No warnings are reported with any compiler.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the last two points suffice since the code checking is done by building the project.</p>
<p>Allow me to emphasize the importance of code checking: since the compilers don't report false positives, this forces us to have warning-free code at all time, which is a big boost for quality assurance!</p>
<h2 id="automatic-build">Automatic build</h2>
<p>First we need to set up the GitHub action in this <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/tests.yml">YAML file</a>.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We install the Nyxt dependencies using the image package manager, here APT.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we install <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">Roswell</a>, a tool that will allow us to easily install the desired Common Lisp compilers since the host system package managers may not have them. Roswell includes <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, so we will leverage this to install all the Common Lisp dependencies of Nyxt.</p></li>
<li><p>Some dependencies are missing from Quicklisp, so we fetch them via our Makefile dedicated rule, then register their location as per the <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/Configuration-DSL.html#Configuration-DSL">ASDF API</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-testing">Automatic testing</h2>
<p>Finally, we run the following:</p>

<p>We load the tests which builds Nyxt itself. If the Nyxt build fails, the error is reported as part of the workflow.</p>
<p>We exit with a custom non-zero error code, here 17. This can help identify the cause of the error in case the output gets confusing.</p>
<p>The rest of the test controls happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt.asd">nyxt.asd</a> file. Our main <code>:nyxt</code> system lists all the tests so that call <code>(asdf:test-system :nyxt)</code> effectively runs the whole test suite.</p>
<p>Each individual test system is specified in the following form:</p>

<p>We've rolled out our own helper function <code>nyxt-run-test</code> to factor some recurring code.</p>

<p>We've added some knobs that we can control externally:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <code>NYXT_TESTS_NO_NETWORK</code> environment variable is set, the test is not run. This is useful to disable tests require a network connection. Some build systems (like Guix) disable network connectivity during builds.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>NXYT_TESTS_ERROR_ON_FAIL</code> is set, the process will exit with a non-zero error code, which will cause the build system, or the integration pipeline to fail and report. This is necessary because otherwise the ASDF test operation does not "fail" in the sense that the process returns the 0 error code by default.</p>
<p>In the YAML file, we set this variable to <code>yes</code>, thus externally commanding our test suite to reflect its error on the pipeline.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automatic-code-checking">Automatic code checking</h2>
<p>Finally, our last step in our YAML file is very simple: it loads a file and executes the <code>compilation-conditions</code> function on systems we want to test, here <code>nyxt</code> and the renderers.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/report-warnings.lisp">this file</a> more closely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First <code>compilation-conditions</code> calls <code>load-system-silently</code> on the recursive dependencies of the system as returned by <code>list-dependencies</code>.</p>
<p>We do this to <em>pre-compile</em> the Nyxt dependencies, thus ensuring that when we compile Nyxt the compiler only reports warnings related to Nyxt and not its dependencies.</p>
<p><code>load-system-silently</code> is like ASDF's <code>load-system</code> but muffles the output to keep the pipeline output shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>An amazing feature of Common Lisp is that the <code>compile</code> function is built into the language, which allows us to control the compilation process in Common Lisp itself!</p>
<p>Thus we collect all conditions that are not redefinitions:</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/jadiv0/how_can_i_report_compilation_warnings_in_ci/g8s5oj4/"><span data-cites="phoe">@phoe</span></a> for this tip!</p>
<p>Note to the attentive reader: <code>redefinition-p</code> is not the proper way to check if a condition is a redefinition. The redefinition condition type is not portable, so the code should be different between SBCL and CCL, but it turns out that this "hack" works in our case.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we report the conditions to the standard output (which will display in the continuous testing web interface) and return a custom non-zero error code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since none of us at Atlas are using a Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu, and since these distributions are among the most popular platforms, it has become increasingly necessary to automate the process of distributing a pre-built <code>.deb</code> package</p>
<p>Automating packaging is no simple task, for this we leverage the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ralt/linux-packaging">linux-packaging</a> Common Lisp library, which itself is based on <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a>.</p>
<p>Beside wrapping <code>fpm</code>, <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically guesses the operating system dependencies for the FFI libraries and statically links the FFI-generated objects into the Lisp image. No more problem distributing <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/osicat/">Osicat</a>!</p>
<p>As for continuous testing, we have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/.github/workflows/package-ubuntu.yml">YAML file</a> which has roughly the same steps except that we don't leverage Roswell here because we are going to build our own SBCL compiler: indeed, <code>linux-packaging</code> requires SBCL to be built with the non-default <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime</code> option.</p>
<p>Notice the new dependency line:</p>

<p>Ruby is required for <code>fpm</code> and SBCL for… rebuilding SBCL!</p>
<p>Not much here since everything happens in the <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/build-ubuntu-package.sh">build-ubuntu-package.sh</a> script:</p>
<ul>
<li>We first install <code>fpm</code>.</li>
<li>Then we build <code>SBCL</code> with the <code>--with-sb-linkable-runtime
 --with-sb-dynamic-core</code> options.</li>
<li>We install Quicklisp manually since this time we don't have Roswell.</li>
<li>We install <code>linux-packaging</code>.</li>
<li>Pitfall: We install a modern version of ASDF since <code>linux-packaging</code> requires a version that's more recent than the one shipped with SBCL (at least as of 2.0.10).</li>
<li>As for continuous testing, we register the current directory in the ASDF registry so that it finds the Nyxt ASDF systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the package build happens in the last command:</p>

<p><code>quickload</code> will drag all <code>linux-packaging</code> and <code>nyxt</code> dependencies. Then we load and make an ASDF system that's dedicated to the creation of the package.</p>
<p>This system is declared in a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/nyxt-ubuntu-package.asd">separate file</a> because otherwise it would make Nyxt depend on <code>linux-packaging</code>, which the end user does not need.</p>
<p>Let's review it:</p>

<p>Here we declare that loading this system will trigger the <code>linux-packaging:build-op</code> operation which will generate a <code>linux-packaging:deb</code> package.</p>
<p>Notice that there is only one knob to control the type of package we want to produce. It's enough to change this value to <code>linux-packaging:rpm</code> to produce an RPM!</p>

<p>Here we list the Common Lisp systems we want to include in our image. Since <code>nyxt/gtk</code> depends on everything else, it's the only system that we need to list.</p>
<p>The <code>:entry-point</code> is the same we use to build Nyxt from the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>Here we list all the metadata for the <code>.deb</code>. Since we decided to store this system in a separate <code>.asd</code> file, it can't automatically inherit from the metadata of the <code>nyxt</code> system. So we need to use a reader macro to explicitly tell ASDF to look for the metadata of Nyxt.</p>

<p>The attentive reader may have noticed that I said that <code>linux-packaging</code> automatically derived the operating system dependencies for FFI packages. Indeed, we don't need to declare that WebKitGTK is a dependency here for instance.</p>
<p>However, some of our code has optional dependencies. While WebKitGTK would work without <code>glib-networking</code> it would have limited functionality, like no HTTPS support.</p>
<p>Other dependencies include those that are typically used by Common Lisp libraries that depend on executables, like <a href="https://github.com/snmsts/trivial-clipboard">trivial-clipboard</a> which depends on an external clipboard program like <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we list all the assets to include in the <code>.deb</code>: icons, <code>.desktop</code> file, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>build-pathname</code> field is the name of the produced executable which will be automatically stored to <code>/usr/bin</code> in the package.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guix test and packaging</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/2-pre-release-4/build-scripts/guix.scm">Guix recipe</a> to build Nyxt using the <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> package manager. There are many benefits in providing a Guix package, among others it allows us to provide a create a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2018/tarballs-the-ultimate-container-image-format/">Guix pack</a> which is an self-containing, portable tarball that can be unpacked and run on any operating system with a Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Another benefit of packaging for Guix is that it uses its own Common Lisp packages instead of Quicklisp to manage the Common Lisp dependencies. This validates our quality assurance one step further.</p></li>
<li><p>Code coverage</p>
<p>SBCL supports coverage reporting thanks to its <code>sb-cover</code> extension. We hope to make use of it to provide the most exhaustive test suite possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

[1]</p><p>But optimize long enough and everything becomes the equivalent of BuzzFeed or porn.</p><p>Clickbait, sex, drama, and superficialness. Being everything to everyone and nothing to no one.</p><p>Groupon’s quality went down the drain because Mason’s employees told him sending more emails per day increased revenue.</p><p>The deals became ever lower in quality and users got annoyed.</p><p>There was a time where people<strong> could not wait</strong> to get an email from Groupon. They had killer deals. They had hilarious copywriters. Even if you didn’t buy, getting an email was a treat. But now that it has been properly sterilized to please spineless, risk-averse shareholders, and optimized for maximum quarterly revenue, can you think of a single person that feels that way anymore? Not one person? Groupon clearly has lost its soul, its essence. Mason said in an interview (can’t recall the source) that he wondered if Groupon was meant to be an extraordinary company, just for a smaller market. It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point. Especially during the Jobs reign. </p><p><em>More on this in the essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a><em> </em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>The purpose of this Suspicion Activity Report (SAR) is to disclose the existence of transactions that do not make sense to our team, as well as introduce an emergency plan to mitigate their impact on the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe">DSLA Token</a>, and the rest of the DSLA family of products.</em></p>

<h3 id="-november-13-2020">📅 November 13, 2020</h3>

<p>It was brought to our attention that large amounts of DSLA tokens originating from the ProBit <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe?a=0x72e5263ff33d2494692d7f94a758aa9f82062f73">liquidity pool</a> have been sold on Uniswap, in highly automated ways.</p>

<h3 id="--november-14-2020">📅  November 14, 2020</h3>

<p>Per our initial investigation, it is indeed unlikely that a human trader would <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa63248a6a421a25d969c3835b6c0ad3afa934885152e8646bd2fddae022eaa8a">withdraw DSLA tokens from ProBit</a>, then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd27a16d359c58b589b5805b39b41e09f2ee61446d8a32159203696cb3ce83859">swap DSLA tokens for USDT on Uniswap</a>, in such a short amount of time (2 minutes), and on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe?a=0xc9cae208c7a00b000bbb4bd0645dd170623e9526">repeated, systematic occasions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="️-intermediate-conclusion">⚠️ Intermediate conclusion</h3>

<p>Burried in otherwise valid transactions, the <code>0xc9cae208c7a00b000bbb4bd0645dd170623e9526</code> wallet involved in these swaps is <strong>either exerting price manipulation, or turning a profit through aggressive arbitrage</strong>.</p>

<p>We have reached to the ProBit team for clarification, as we lack the elements to clearly establish responsibilities at this stage.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mitigation-plan">Mitigation Plan</h2>

<p>There is no reliable model for quantifying the impact of programmatic sell-offs on the price of assets and their market capitalization.</p>

<p>But we can still harden DSLA against suppression, manipulation, and trading abuse, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A)</strong> Recapturing lost value by reducing DSLA’s total supply;</li>
  <li><strong>B)</strong> Parting ways with our centralized cryptocurrency exchanges;</li>
  <li><strong>C)</strong> Adding liquidity and creating new LP incentives across all DEX pools.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a--2b-dsla-token-burn">A) 🔥 2B+ DSLA Token Burn</h3>

<p>On November 30, 2020, we will proceed with a <strong>2,000,000,000.00 DSLA token burn</strong> using our personal, team, company and participating partners wallets. All other DSLA holders will benefit from the increase in scarcity / decrease in total supply of DSLA.</p>

<p>In that same spirit, we will also inaugurate a new section on the <a href="https://stacktical.com/">DSLA Protocol official website</a>, dedicated to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tracking of your DSLA holdings;</li>
  <li>The updated DSLA token distribution and the detailed purpose of company wallets;</li>
  <li>The monitoring of DSLA transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These information also aim at increasing the overall auditability of the project, in preparation for our mainnet launch.</p>

<h3 id="b--trusted-trading-platforms">B) 🤝 Trusted Trading Platforms</h3>

<p><strong>As we are figuring out the ins and outs of the sell-off with the ProBit team, we strongly advise you do not deposit any funds to the exchange, and consider withdrawing your funds as soon as possible.</strong> Here is a list of more reliable, decentralized options:</p>

                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

            <p>This post is about how I renamed a go module from
github.com/something/somethingelse to go.gianarb.it/somethingelse. It requires
zero infrastructure, just a static site that can run on GitHub.</p>

<p>I used one of the many projects I have that nobody cares about
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc">gianarb/go-irc</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>You know, is one of those ideas you have in your mind for ages, but who cares?
At least for me that I don’t have any cool open source project under my name.</p>

<p>I am not one of those people who suffer when realizing that it is not escale. If
you end up having a project that gets traction and is tight to github.com
because you didn’t think about another way to go, you are stuck. And even if
GitHub today is cool, it won’t stay cool forever.</p>

<p>Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> today
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1327240411266641920">tweeted</a> about this
topic, and I looked at how he set up filippo.io/age to solve this little
dilemma.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>This is not about how to escape from GitHub but is about setting up a “vanity
URL” that won’t lock you or your project to GitHub. It does not require any
infrastructure, just a domain that you can point to a GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a DNS record that points as CNAME to <code>&lt;github-handle&gt;.github.io</code>. I
used go.gianarb.it</li>
  <li>Create a repository; it will be the home for your static site. Mine is
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-libraries">gianarb/go-libraries</a></li>
  <li>Set the repository up to be a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub page</a> and
enable HTTPS. You can enable it via the repository Settings; we will push
HTML files to it directly, so I used the master branch as the GitHub page’s
source.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-your-first-library">Add your first library.</h3>

<p>If your library is already using go mod, you have to change the module name to
the new one. In my case, from was github.com/gianarb/go-irc to
go.gianarb.it/irc. I just searched and replaced with my editor in all the
project. Renaming a module is a bc break; I am not sure how to avoid or mitigate
that; if you know, let me know!</p>

<p>You can push a new file to your static site repository; I called my irc:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>name=</span><span>"go-import"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"go.gianarb.it/irc git https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>http-equiv=</span><span>"refresh"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"0;URL='https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
        Redirecting you to the <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>project page<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>...
    <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace your URL accordingly, but as soon as you push this file and GitHub will
release it to your page, you will be able to import: <code>go.gianarb.it/irc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This methods works as a safeguard if you decide to move your code out from
GitHub. The static site can be deployed to Netlify, S3 or served by Nginx. It
does not need to stay on GitHub.</p>

<p>Same for your code, if you decide to move from GitHub to GitLab you can do it
transparently.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>
<p>Let’s see if DigitalOcean has anything about this: Bingo!</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our engineering team is investigating reports of DNS connectivity issues while using the Google resolvers. During… <a href="https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq">https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq</a></p>
<p>— DigitalOcean Status (@DOStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/DOStatus/status/846430105094250496">March 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I edit the resolv.conf (and interfaces) to reflect a change to OpenDNS as the primary DNS with Google as the fallback DNS (as per the article linked later in the Tweet).</p>
<p>Restart networking.</p>
<p>Boom, everything is working.</p>
<p>It was DNS.</p>
<p><span><strong>It’s always DNS.</strong></span></p>
<p>-M, out.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

<p>Starting January 21, 2021 and ending September 1, 2021, sites using TLS/SSL certificates issued by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">ISRG</a>‘s <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> service <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html">will be transitioning to a certificate chain based on the ISRG Root X1 certificate</a> instead of <a href="https://www.identrust.com/">IdenTrust</a>‘s DST Root X3. After the DST Root X3 certificate expiry on September 30, 2021, it will no longer be usable to bootstrap ISRG in legacy trusted root certificate stores.</p>
<p>This affects Android prior to 7.1.1.</p>
<p>Developers of Android apps can use <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config">Network Security Configuration</a> to enable their apps to be compatible with sites using Let’s Encrypt after January 21, 2021. </p>
<ol><li>Add <code>android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"</code> as an attribute of the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</li><li>Create a <code>res/xml/network_security_config.xml</code> file with the following contents:</li></ol>

&lt;network-security-config&gt;<br>    &lt;base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted<strong>="false"</strong>&gt;<br>        &lt;trust-anchors&gt;<br>            &lt;certificates src<strong>="@raw/isrg_root_x2" </strong>/&gt;<br>            &lt;certificates src<strong>="@raw/isrg_root_x1" </strong>/&gt;<br>            &lt;certificates src<strong>="system" </strong>/&gt;<br>        &lt;/trust-anchors&gt;<br>    &lt;/base-config&gt;<br>&lt;/network-security-config&gt;</pre>
<ol start="3"><li>Download <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.der">ISRG Root X1</a> and store it in <code>res/raw/isrg_root_x1.der</code></li><li>Download <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrg-root-x2.der">ISRG Root X2</a> and store it in <code>res/raw/isrg_root_x2.der</code></li><li>If your app connects over cleartext in addition to TLS, change <code>cleartextTrafficPermitted</code> in the <code>network_security_config.xml</code> above to <code>true</code>.</li></ol>
<p>Instead of adding ISRG’s roots to the existing system root store, you may be considering replacing it entirely with an up-to-date root store such as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates">Mozilla Firefox</a>‘s or <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy">Google Chrome’s upcoming</a> <a href="https://g.co/chrome/root-store">root store</a>. Use caution — browser root store programs implement <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Additional_Trust_Changes">additional</a> <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/symantec-legacy-pki">controls</a> through custom certificate verification code which will not be implementable using a Network Security Configuration.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol><li>Network Security Configuration may only fully work with Android 7.0+. Fortunately for me, Android Nougat 7.0 is the oldest version of Android supported by the apps I’m actively involved in maintaining.</li><li>Let’s Encrypt’s blog post indicates a DST Root X3 expiration date of September 1, 2021 instead of September 30, 2021. This may indicate the last date for which a cross-signature has been arranged, or it may be due to an error.</li></ol>

Apart from a tenuous and vague “phase one” trade deal, any kind of truce in the ongoing China-U.S. trade war seems distant. And without a resolution in the next few weeks, nearly all goods traded between the U.S. and China will have tariffs by December 15.</span></p><p id="viewer-adua0"><span>Is it any wonder why many manufacturers are now considering leaving China, while others are accelerating earlier plans to exit.</span></p><p id="viewer-drn2j"><span>Manufacturing in India stands out as a cost-effective alternative to China. Companies like Hasbro have announced plans to limit their number of China-made products to half, choosing to relocate much of their production to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-3clqd"><span>And Taiwanese Foxconn, which manufacturers Apple’s iPhone and Amazon’s Echo, built their first plant in India in 2015 and plans to expand operations there.</span></p><p id="viewer-5a9o5"><span>But many other companies are either looking for solutions outside India or prefer to remain in China. They view India’s many challenges—a skills gap and inadequate infrastructure among them—as insurmountable barriers to their continued success.</span></p><p id="viewer-1kpog"><span>Let’s explore how manufacturing compares between India and China and whether India may be the right sourcing choice for you.</span></p><div id="viewer-4c75k"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.aliaworld.com/post/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_b886c6ba02cb42f6ba3909c99634d44b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_400%2Ch_256%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3fccd7_b886c6ba02cb42f6ba3909c99634d44b~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><h2 id="viewer-68ao9"><span>WHAT DOES INDIA EXPORT TODAY?</span></h2><p id="viewer-9cbef"><span>India exported more than $323 billion worth of goods in 2018. Meanwhile, China exported goods valued at nearly eight times as much. China’s top exports included products such as electrical machinery, appliances and equipment. While raw materials and products requiring less sophisticated manufacturing composed the majority of India’s exports.</span></p><p id="viewer-f2041"><span><strong>Mineral products, chemical products and precious metals and stones</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9sv1v"><span>India’s top exports are dominated by mineral products (16 percent), chemical products (14 percent) and precious metals (12 percent). Mineral products include mineral fuels and oils, such as Manufacturing in India vs. Chinapetroleum.</span></p><p id="viewer-4t78m"><span>Chemical products include various organic and inorganic chemicals, soaps, tanning dyes, fertilizers, explosives and, most notably, pharmaceuticals. India’s pharmaceutical industry now reportedly supplies:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-947qg"><p>50 percent of the world’s demand for various vaccines</p></li><li id="viewer-2k7f4"><p>40 percent of U.S. demand for generic drugs; and</p></li><li id="viewer-ef5ro"><p>25 percent of all medicine in the UK</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-baho4"><span>Contributing seven percent of the country’s GDP, India’s precious metals and stones industry employs 4.6 million workers.

Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector. Though the manufacturing sector now contributes only 16 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the “Make in India” initiative aims to boost that contribution to 25 percent by 2022.</span></p><p id="viewer-caorn"><span>And companies like Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus are investing heavily in R&amp;D in India. “Our success in India has proven to be a great model for our growth in other regions,” says OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. “…We are now closer to making India as our second headquarters.”</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6tjmf"><span>COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED LABOR IN INDIA AND CHINA</span></h2><p id="viewer-fp3rq"><span>Differences in manufacturing wages, size and skill level of the labor force should be at the forefront of your decision to move production from China to India.

And importers have watched China’s labor costs soar in recent decades, often growing by 10-15 percent annually. China’s minimum wages, which now range from about US$140 to US$346 per month, are set at the provincial level.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u605"><span>India’s minimum wages similarly vary across states and range from about US$66 to US$202. Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative. And importers of labor-intensive products, like garments and textiles, are in the best position to realize cost savings by moving to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-2dtbl"><span><strong>Labor force size and skill level</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-5d337"><span>Among the many manufacturing locations opposing China, India is unmatched in the size of its labor force. According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong. But Indonesia’s labor force, with 134 million workers, is a distant third for the region.</span></p><p id="viewer-fh5j3"><span>India falls behind many of its neighbors with regard to factors the World Economic Forum use to rank countries in their human capital report. India ranks 103rd overall, while China ranks 34th.</span></p><p id="viewer-3umpt"><span>One area where India suffers a deficiency is in “know-how”, which includes the breadth and depth of specialized skills at work. We see this directly at play in the quality and complexity of the country’s top export products. This metric also measures employers’ perceived ease at filling job vacancies.</span></p><p id="viewer-8obvp"><span>India also has room to grow with regard to its labor development rank. This rank considers access to and enrollment in formal education, opportunities to upskill and how well the education system fits the needs of a competitive economy.</span></p><p id="viewer-6aqg0"><span>Some have attributed the low development rank to India’s shortage of vocational schools.</span></p><p id="viewer-crl8q"><span>The relatively low labor participation rate in India—just 67 percent among the 25-54 age group as of 2017—also hurt the country’s human capital rank. India’s employment gender gap, one of the world’s largest, was another major contributor. In contrast, China achieved a labor participation rate of 88 percent for the same age group.</span></p><p id="viewer-3r1pr"><span>On the positive side, India has performed relatively well in terms of quality of education, staff training and economic complexity.</span></p><p id="viewer-aa1e7"><span>Read further at <a href="https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-1hgbn"><span><em><strong>If you are looking forward to source high-quality metal jewelry then reach out to us at </strong></em><a href="mailto:info@aliajewelery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong><u>info@aliajewelery.com</u></strong></em></a><em><strong> &amp; we'll provide you with a free quote as per your requirement.</strong></em></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3 id="are-we-living-in-a-simulation"><strong>Are we living in a simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>With the evident success of computer technologies 
this question raises more and more frequently.</p>

<p>Tech people mostly agree that this is a possible scenario, 
it could even be that we live in a multiple layers of simulations -
a simulation that runs in another simulation and so on.</p>

<p>While there is probably no way to disprove this hypothesis 
I argue that believing in such thing has a negative psychological effect 
on an individual and a society in general.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-simulation"><strong>What do we mean by simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>In a process of simulation we are trying to model and imitate some real phenomena with the purpose of predicting or imposing the future outcomes. An imitation is generally much cheaper to perform than a real process. So we can trial a lot of different scenarios to find the best strategy before implementing it in reality.</p>

<p>It can be a computer modeling of a physical process or experiment. A repetition of some upcoming performance. Or even a thought process when we try to imagine a tree of possible events and our possible responses.</p>

<p>Virtual reality or a computer game also can be considered as a simulation since we model some elements of our real world (with some fictional elements, though) in a controllable and cheaper environment.</p>

<p>In general, all simulations are irrelevant when the best strategy is found.</p>

<p>But observe that in any case simulation is still part of the reality. Every completed game, no matter how useless it was, is still part of our world. And due to the butterfly effect every tiny event can have a huge impact in the future.</p>

<p>So, a simulation is always real, even if it predates the <em>real action</em>. It’s just way less important.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-prefer-to-think-that-we-live-in-a-less-important-world"><strong>Why would we prefer to think that we live in a less important world?</strong></h3>

<p>The simple answer is — people tend to downgrade what they see if they don’t like that. An irresponsible and childish person became a president of a powerful country? A girl has to tell to world leaders what to do with the Earth’s climate? No, this doesn’t imply that we live in some kind of game, or a part of a show. There are explanations and they are real. We just don’t know or understand them.</p>

<p>Another reason could be that the world became so big and interconnected that we feel ourselves in much less control. There are too many information, too many factors, too many actors. Also the pace of change is not making us more certain about the future. The world is less predictable than ever today.</p>

<p>Finally, downgrading reality is a psychological way to flee from our responsibilities in life. Why bother to do something if everything is not important?</p>

<h3 id="the-effects-of-such-belief"><strong>The effects of such belief</strong></h3>

<p>Believing that the world is just a simulation implies that we, our feelings and our actions are not that important either.</p>

<p>The is a huge amplifier of depression if a person has already lost their sense and purpose in life. Or this could be an excuse to live a meaningless life.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you live in a society that think the world around is not that important, including you, obviously. 
You could be an NPC (non-player character) in this game, after all. Just an AI script written by a programmer from the <em>true world</em>. Would you like to live in such community?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>

<p>Do not downgrade <em>the reality</em> of what you see simply because you don’t like it, don’t understand or don’t control it. All your actions, your feelings, your views and your life in general are <em>matter</em>, as well as the life of others.</p>

It’s only reserved to the most stubborn internet archive dvelvers.</p><p>The third approach works surprisingly well as Emacs kept good support for terminal rendering<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Actually this goes further as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/daniel-colascione/buttery-smooth-emacs/10155313440066102">GUI rendering is built on top of the TUI codebase</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Whoever made Emacs into a native X11 program […] pretended the GUI was a text terminal. – Daniel Colascione</p></blockquote><h2 id="emacs-on-the-go">Emacs on the Go</h2><p>Another appeal of exploring alternative hardware is the perspective of having an Emacs instance on the go.</p><p>Nowadays the best approach is to have an Android device with Emacs installed through <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a> and a bluetooth keyboard.</p><p>Most people use a smartphone. If the screen feels too small, one can use a tablet<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup>.</p><p>As far as Org-mode is concerned, we nowadays have decent applications such as <a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> (Android), <a href="https://beorgapp.com/">beorg</a> (iOS), <a href="https://organice.200ok.ch/">organice</a> and <a href="https://org-web.org/">org-web</a> (web, mobile-friendly).</p><p>Back in 2007, smartphones (as we know them) where in their infancy and I was in dire need for a solution.</p><p>At the time, the only possibility was to find an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-mobile_PC">UMPC</a>.

    <p>This is the 1967 Turing award lecture by Maurice V. Wilkes. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Wikipedia</a>, Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. This lecture does a wide survey of computer as they were in 1968 and makes many accurate predictions. Yellow highlights/annotations are my own. <a onclick="disableHighlight()" href="#">You can disable them.</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Reminiscences on the early developments leading to large scale electronic
computers show that it took much longer than was expected for the first of
the more ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation. Comments on the present computer field
assess the needs for future development.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that many of the Turing lecturers who will follow me will
be people who were acquainted with Alan Turing. The work on computable
numbers, for which he is famous, was published in 1936 before digital
computers existed. Later he became one of the first of a distinguished
succession of able mathematicians who have made contributions to the
computer field. He was a colorful figure in the early days of digital
computer development in England, and I would find it difficult to speak of
that period without making some references to him.</p>

<h2 id="pioneering-days">Pioneering Days</h2>

<p>An event of first importance in my life occurred in 1946, when I received a
telegram inviting me to attend in the late summer of that year a course on
computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. I
was able to attend the latter part of the course, and a wonderful experience
it was. No such course had ever been held before, and the achievements of
the Moore School, and other computer pioneers, were known to few. There were
28 students from 20 organizations. The principal instructors were John
Mauchly and Prosper Eckert. They were fresh from their triumph as designers
of the ENIAC, which was the first electronic digital computer, although it
did not work on the stored program principle. The scale of this machine
would be impressive even today  – it ran to over 18,000 vacuum tubes.
Although the ENIAC was very successful – and very fast  – for the
computation of ballistic tables, which was the application for which the
project was negotiated, it had severe limitations which greatly restricted
its application as a general purpose computing device. In the first place,
the program was set up by means of plugs and sockets and switches, and it
took a long time to change from one problem to another. In the second place,
it had internal storage capacity for 20 numbers only. Eckert and Mauchly
appreciated that the main problem was one of storage, and they proposed for
future machines the use of ultrasonic delay lines. Instructions and numbers
would be mixed in the same memory in the way to which we are now accustomed.
Once the new principles were enunciated, it was seen that computers of
greater power than the ENIAC could be built with one tenth the amount of
equipment.</p>

<p>Von Neumann was, at that time, associated with the Moore School group in a
consultative capacity, although I did not personally become acquainted with
him until somewhat later. The computing field owes a very great debt to yon
Neumann. He appreciated at once the possibilities of what became known as
logical design, and the potentialities implicit in the stored program
principle. That von Neumann should bring his great prestige and influence to
bear was important, since the new ideas were too revolutionary for some, and
powerful voices were being raised to say that the ultrasonic memory would
not be reliable enough, and that to mix instructions and numbers in the same
memory was going against nature.</p>

<p>Subsequent developments have provided a decisive vindication of the
principles taught by Eckert and Mauchly in 1946 to those of us who were
fortunate enough to be in the course. There was, however, a difficult period
in the early 1950s. The first operating stored-program computers were,
naturally enough, laboratory models; they were not fully engineered and they
by no means exploited the full capability of the technology of the time. <mark>It
took much longer than people had expected for the first of the more
ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation.</mark> In retrospect, the period seems a short
one; at the time, it was a period of much heart searching and even
recrimination.</p>

<p>I have often felt during the past year that we are going through a very
similar phase in relation to time sharing. This is a development carrying
with it many far-reaching implications concerning the relationship of
computers to individual users and to communities, and one that has stirred
many people’s imaginations. It is now several years since the pioneering
systems were demonstrated. Once again, it is taking longer than people
expected to pass from experimental systems to highly developed ones that
fully exploit the technology that we have available. The result is a period
of uncertainty and questioning that closely resembles the earlier period to
which I referred. When it is all over, it will not take us long to forget
the trials and tribulations that we are now going through.</p>

<p>In ultrasonic memories, it was customary to store up to 32 words end to end
in the same delay line. The pulse rate was fairly high, but people were much
worried about the time spent in waiting for the right word to come around.
Most delay line computers were, therefore, designed so that, with the
exercise of cunning, the programmer could place his instructions and numbers
in the memory in such a way that the waiting time was minimized. Turing
himself was a pioneer in this type of logical design. Similar methods were
later applied to computers which used a magnetic drum as their memory and,
altogether, the subject of optimum coding, as it was called, was a
flourishing one. I felt that this kind of human ingenuity was misplaced as a
long-term investment, since sooner or later we would have truly
random-access memories. We therefore did not have anything to do with
optimum coding in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although a mathematician, Turing took quite an interest in the engineering
side of computer design. There was some discussion in 1947 as to whether a
cheaper substance than mercury could not be found for use as an ultrasonic
delay medium. Turing’s contribution to this discussion was to advocate the
use of gin, which he said contained alcohol and water in just the right
proportions to give a zero temperature coefficient of propagation velocity
at room temperature.</p>

<p>A source of strength in the early days was that groups in various parts of
the world were prepared to construct experimental computers without
necessarily intending them to be the prototype for serial production. As a
result, there became available a body of knowledge about what would work and
what would not work, about what it was profitable to do and what it was not
profitable to do. While, looking around at the computers commercially
available today, one cannot feel that all the lessons were learned, there is
no doubt that this diversity of research in the early days has paid good
dividends. It is, I think, important that we should have similar diversity
today when we are learning how to construct large, multiple-access,
multi-programmed, multi-processor computer systems. <mark>Instead of putting
together components and vacuum tubes to make a computer, we have now to
learn how to put together memory modules, processors, and peripheral devices
to make a system</mark>.<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
S: What we now call as <em>computer architecture</em>.
</span>
I hope that money will be available to finance the
construction of large systems intended for research only.</p>

<p>Much of the early engineering development of digital computers was done in
universities. A few years ago, the view was commonly expressed that
universities had played their part in computer design, and that the matter
could now safely be left to industry. I do not think that it is necessary
that work on computer design should go on in all universities, but I am glad
that some have remained active in the field. Apart from the obvious
functions of universities in spreading knowledge, and keeping in the public
domain material that might otherwise be hidden, universities can make a
special contribution by reason of their freedom from commercial
considerations, including freedom from the need to follow the fashion.</p>

<h2 id="good-language-and-bad">Good Language and Bad</h2>

<p><mark>Gradually, controversies about the design of computers themselves died down
and we all began to argue about the merits or demerits of sophisticated
programming techniques; the battle for automatic programming or, as we
should now say, for the use of higher level programming languages, had
begun.</mark> I well remember taking part at one of the early ACM meetings – it
must have been about 1953 – in a debate on this subject. John Carr was also
a speaker and he distinguished two groups of programmers; the first
comprised the “primitives,” who believed that, all instructions should be
written in octal, hexadecimal, or some similar form, and who had no time for
what they called fancy schemes, while the second comprised the “space
cadets,” who saw themselves as the pioneers of a new age. I hastened to
enroll myself as a space cadet, although I remember issuing a warning
against relying on interpretive systems, for which there was then something
of a vogue, rather than on compilers. (I do not think that the term compiler
was then in general use, although it had in fact been introduced by Grace
Hopper.)</p>

<p>The serious arguments advanced against automatic programming had to do with
efficiency. <mark>Not only was the running time of a compiled program longer than
that of a hand-coded program, but, what was then more serious, it needed
more memory.</mark> In …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog has never been a money-making endeavor. I’ve had a series of jobs in software engineering and leadership that have paid my rent since 2009. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to tinker with ways how this blog could pay for its own domain name renewal fees.</p><h3 id="itunes--amazon-2016-2018">iTunes &amp; Amazon (2016-2018)</h3><p>For a few years, I had affiliate links on the site, for iTunes and Amazon links. The <a href="https://appleservices-console.partnerize.com/login/appleservices/en_us">Apple partner program</a> is relatively unknown but was pretty easy to use. Sticking <code>&amp;at=1010lmEW</code> at the end of links to the iTunes store tagged them with your website as an origin, and they give some low percentage of application and music sales. In the time I used it, the total was around $30.</p><p>Amazon Affiliates is the most famous program of its type on the internet. For a while, whenever I linked to Amazon, I’d use those links. It yielded slightly more than iTunes, in total around $60 over the course of three years, or $20 a year.</p><p>I removed all of these links in 2018. Disclosing that <em>this site uses affiliate links</em> on the About page felt a little grimy, and the idea that I might be linking to something just to earn a buck – though it was never true – felt like something to be entirely avoided. Plus, linking to Amazon meant enriching a company that’s <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-truth-about-injuries-at-amazon/">really</a>, <a href="https://themarkup.org/2020/07/30/congressional-antitrust-tech-hearing-recap-facebook-amazon-alphabet-google-apple">really</a>, not on the right side of history.</p><h3 id="brave">Brave</h3><p>I set up this site with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>’s rewards system in mid-2019. Brave, the browser, has a pretty complicated ecosystem around it: a <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">cryptocurrency, BAT</a>, a <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">publisher-side interface</a>, and a bunch of details that they’re lining up to eventually have the Brave browser itself serve ads on webpages that allow it.</p><p>Setting up a site with Brave Publishers involves a text file <a href="https://macwright.com/.well-known/brave-rewards-verification.txt"><code>brave-rewards-verification.txt</code></a>, to link your account with your website, and then setting up an account on <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, a sort of cryptocurrency wallet, to convert your money to USD, some other sort of cryptocurrency, or, in the rarest case, use it to buy something with crypto.</p><p><img alt="Brave Rewards" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-11-15-mini-monetization-experiments-brave-rewards.png"></p><p>All-in-all, this site has earned 162 BAT, which, at $0.19 each, is about $30. <del>The reason <em>why</em> it makes any money from Brave is a total mystery to me. Sure, someone directly tipped 9.5 BAT, or about $2, but where did the rest come from? I didn’t use affiliate links to encourage people to use the Brave browser - I don’t use it myself at all, it seems fine though. The thing where Brave shows ads on webpages isn’t launched yet, as far as I can tell. It’s cool that money appeared somewhere, but it’s hard to say why.</del></p><p><a href="https://mostlysubjective.com/about/">Atanas Entchev</a> explains that Brave opens ads in separate tabs, which is where the ad revenue is coming from, and then those collected BAT tokens are distributed to sites like this one. Thanks!</p><h3 id="coil">Coil</h3><p>More recently, I set up <a href="https://coil.com/about">Coil</a> on this site. Like Brave, it requires you to sort of ‘confirm’ that you own the website and link it to your site. To do that, you get a sort of special code from Uphold and put that in a meta tag on the page:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;meta</span>
  <span>name=</span><span>"monetization"</span>
  <span>content=</span><span>"$ilp.uphold.com/Kk2HbEYgFH6K"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Coil’s a very interesting sign of the times: a blockchain-powered technology behind a startup that is apparently trying hard to never mention blockchains or crypto. To me at least, that seems wise. The culture and thought around crypto and blockchains have been poisoned by scammers, techno-liberatarians, and all sorts of baddies.</p><p>I think the economics around Coil are a lot more straightforward than Brave: people install a browser extension or use the Puma Browser, and they pay $5 a month to fund websites that support it. It’s much newer and less popular than Brave, and as a result, so far…&nbsp;it earns about $0.04 a week.</p><h3 id="ko-fi">Ko-fi</h3><p>Finally, I’ve had a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> link up on the /about page for a while. It’s been nice, and is the simplest and most straightforward sort of option: every once in a while, someone enjoys an article and sends a few dollars my way.</p><p>I think that it’s a nicer fit for someone like me who doesn’t have a fixed topic or schedule. I write just when I feel strongly about something, or have something I think is interesting to share. I don’t want to crank out a weekly or month post about JavaScript or React or maps in order to fit a schedule, and disconnect my enthusiasm with my output.</p><h3 id="how-its-going">How it’s going</h3><p>My goal with monetization is to cover domain name registrations for this site and to keep a finger on the pulse of this “indieweb monetization” idea to see if it ever yields something worthwhile. I’m nearly paying for the domain names, but web monetization is still a pretty nascent field.</p><ul><li>Brave is neat because people passively fund your site, but it’s really opaque about where money comes from.</li><li>Ko-fi is great, very casual, and pretty low-tech: it’s just a fancy way to accept PayPal.</li><li>Coil is interesting and doesn’t try to do a fancy multi-sided market like Brave does, but very few people use it.</li></ul><p>What Brave and Coil have in common is a pretty high level of inefficiency and semi-hidden fees.</p><ul><li>When you get paid out for Brave’s rewards system, Brave takes a 5% fee that they bury in the UI.</li><li>When you’re paid from Coil, Uphold takes a 1.2% fee that they round up to the nearest penny, which in my case rounds it up to 16%.</li><li>You can’t spend BAT, the Brave currency, so you need to convert it to USD or another cryptocurrency, which means another fee, <a href="https://uphold.com/en-gb/get-started/service-fees">implemented as a spread</a>, that’s at least a few percent of the transaction.</li></ul><p>Ko-fi, which uses no crypto technology, charges zero fees on their transactions.</p><p>My goals for this site are very modest. If I were aiming higher, then I’d look to <a href="https://substack.com/">substack</a> or try writing on Medium or a syndicated blog. But I don’t want to lock away content, or lock myself into a publishing schedule or another set of expectations. So for those constraints, it seems like these systems for micropayments and little gratitudes will do the trick, without affiliating this site with a monopoly.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A Short History of Romaji]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

<![CDATA[Bootstrapped: From Almost Shutting Down to 100 Paying Customers]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span></span>
<span>175</span>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, we got our 100th paying customer for Hyvor Talk. As an independent bootstrapped product, this is a huge milestone.</p>
<h2>History of Hyvor Talk</h2>
<p>In 2018, I was learning web development and wrote my journey on my blog. I wanted to add comments to that blog and the most popular option was Disqus. I went with it, and Disqus started showing ads on my website after a while. That was not nice. I didn’t like Disqus’s UI either. And, Disqus has <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">serious privacy concerns</a>. So, I coded my own commenting system. I didn’t have any plans to make it a SaaS product – I just needed commenting functionality for my blog. However, if someone wanted, I added an option to log in and use the system on their website.</p>
<p>I bought the <strong>hyvor.com</strong> domain a long time ago, having the dream of creating a successful brand called “Hyvor”. Even I wasn’t sure this side project was the way to build this brand, I published it as a product of Hyvor, naming it Hyvor Talk. Until 2020, it was free and a few bloggers used it. I published it on a few startup directories and got a little traction. But, the product wasn’t attractive at this time. And, it was just a side project with no intention of making money from it.</p>
<h2>Working Full-time and Adding Subscriptions</h2>
<p>In January this year (2020), I started working full-time on Hyvor Talk with my partner, Ishini. Both of us were just 19 years old, finished school, no much work to do. So, we could completely focus on Hyvor Talk. We added some cool features and created a better landing page.</p>
<p>The next thing was adding subscriptions. Here we stuck. Paypal and Stripe don’t support Sri Lanka. One option was registering the business in the US and using Stripe, which was expensive for us. However, thankfully, we found Paddle.com, which is built only for SaaS (We won’t be here without Paddle!)</p>
<p>Then, we added two paid plans: $40/month and $1000/month (Yes, not flexible). We worked so hard on the product (almost 16-18 hours a day) in January, sharing on forums, spamming on Facebook Groups. Nothing worked. At this time, we had zero knowledge of marketing. So, we struggled.</p>
<h2>It’s March, 1000s of Hours of Work, 0 Paid Users</h2>
<p>It was March. We’ve worked endless hours of work. No paid customers. Only a few free plan users, who just tested the system and went away. Maybe we were doing something wrong? Maybe the product wasn’t so good? Maybe there wasn’t a market for a new commenting platform? So many things came up to our minds. At this time, I was freelancing to make money and spending that for hosting, paid promotions, etc.</p>
<p>We made $0 in two months. In the first week of March, I asked Ishini “should we continue this?”. We were like yes, no, yes, no, yes, no… However, we decided not to give up because we believed in ourselves and our product. We made more features. Changed landing pages, tried different acquisition channels, and did everything we could.</p>
<h2>The First Paying User</h2>
<p>March 23rd was the day! We got our first paid customer who subscribed to our $40/month plan. We celebrated this like we just won the whole world. Now, we spend $5 for hosting and earn $40 per month. Yay, profitable (kind of). This made us feel very happy. Yes, $35 cannot do much, but if you are a bootstrapper, you know how it feels.</p>
<h2>Changing Pricing &amp; Growth</h2>
<p>We also made pricing more flexible in April. We added two types of plans called Premium (from $5/month) and Business (from $35/month). We got a few free plan users and paid customers. Still, we were on the edge of the sword. However, we started to see a growth in organic traffic to our articles on this blog.</p>
<p>Then, in May, our first employee, Rohitha, joined our team for content marketing. This had a huge impact on our growth. I could focus on the development part, Ishini did the designing and graphics, Rohitha worked on content writing, which is a great funnel for a small team like us.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of the new users come through Google. Besides that, we also see a lot of users directly coming to our website, starting the trial, and subscribing to paid plans on the first day of trial. Even I’m not sure, I think this is “word of mouth”.</p>
<h2>Removing the Free Plan</h2>
<p>When September started, we had 53 paying customers. At this point, we were fully profitable. After a lot of discussions, we made the decision to remove the free plan for some reasons. Since the start, we thought we would remove the free plan someday. However, it happened earlier than we thought because our free plan user base started to grow faster, and converting them to paid is a huge hassle (I’ll explain why it’s hard to have a free plan for a pageviews-based pricing model in a future post).</p>
<p>We removed the free plan on September 5th. And, our growth since then is tremendous. We had 56 customers then (from March to September, 6 months). We almost doubled the number in just 2 months.</p>

<h2>What to take from this story?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this article, probably you are an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/start">indiehacker</a>, or willing to be one someday. Here are some things I believe as a bootstrapper, which might be helpful for you.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Learn but don’t imitate</strong>: Read other’s stories. But, do not imitate them! Create your own story. For example, product X shared their story to 1m ARR in 2 years. You don’t have to do the same thing. Do it at your own pace in your own way. Try everything and find the best way that fits you. Most importantly, don’t give up.</li><li><strong>Make decisions carefully</strong>: I turned down AppSumo promotion, multiple investing requests just to be fully independent. Also, removing the free plan (a very hard decision) accelerated our growth. You don’t have to do the same. Do what you think is correct. Don’t be afraid to make hard decisions in the first couple of months.</li><li><strong>Improve your product</strong>: Get feedback from your customers and improve the product. For example, we have a great discord community of ~100 website owners who give us feedback to improve our product. Our best features were suggested by these users.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I want to thank each of our customers for believing in us throughout this journey. Leave any questions below in the comments section.</p>
<p>PS: We do not disclose our MRR/ARR.</p>

			<p>Do you remember the Guardian article written by a robot? It was the work of the new and powerful GPT-3.</p>
<h2><strong>What is GPT-3?</strong></h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a text generation technology developed by OpenAI, a well-known artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At the moment, not everyone can get access to it. OpenAI wants to ensure that no one misuses it. This is why it is available to only selected people.</p>
<p>As an SEO professional, I was excited to use GPT-3 in ways that can help the people in the SEO industry.</p>
<p>Before wasting any time, I decided to do whatever it takes to get my hands on GPT-3.</p>
<h2>Here is how I got access to GPT-3:</h2>
<h3><strong>OpenAI API waitlist form</strong></h3>
<p>I first applied for GPT-3 API through OpenAI’s official Waitlist form. On the form, I mentioned the intended purpose and the details about my project.</p>
<p><img src="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg" alt="OpenAI API Access - How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!" width="1868" height="851" srcset="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg 1868w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-300x137.jpg 300w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-150x68.jpg 150w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-768x350.jpg 768w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-500x228.jpg 500w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-800x364.jpg 800w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1280x583.jpg 1280w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1536x700.jpg 1536w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-848x386.jpg 848w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1140x519.jpg 1140w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1170x533.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1868px) 100vw, 1868px" title="How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!"></p>
<p>After applying, I anxiously waited to get a response. Two days had passed, but no response came.</p>
<p>I sent a follow-up email. Still, no reply… A week had gone, though, no progress was made.</p>
<h3><strong>Go the extra mile and show that you are serious</strong></h3>
<p>My frustration was growing. But I thought there must be something missing. So, I thought of exploring Twitter and seeing if any users got access to it.</p>
<p>There, I read the tweets of a few people who were able to get GPT-3 access. Their advice was to ‘go the extra mile’ so that the OpenAI engineer or the Chairman can get your attention, and they can see that you are serious.</p>
<p>So, this is what I did:</p>
<ul><li>Purchased a fancy domain for my intended project.</li>
<li>Designed a demo landing page along with a small animation – just to give a glimpse of what’s in store. And how my idea can benefit people.</li>
<li>Tweeted about my project with a video and tagged OpenAI chairman. After only 10 minutes, I received a reply from him asking me for my email. And boom, I got access.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@gdb</a> Hi Greg. My <a href="https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv</a> project is still awaiting GPT-3 access.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you maybe able to expedite the process? <a href="https://t.co/J2NeDvbgHF" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/J2NeDvbgHF</a></p>
<p>— Ashar Jamil (@Asharjamil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Asharjamil/status/1317163403681693699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">October 16, 2020</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It took some effort, but it was worth it. Filling the application form with beneficial intended purposes will not be enough. You will have to make an extra effort and show that you mean business.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to get access to GPT-3, my advice will be to showcase your project demo; and invest a little in your project so that it looks professional. It will increase your chances of getting access.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you have to work for it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

      <div><p>If you're a lover of indoor gardening and still a newbie who don't understand how indoor gardening works, you first need to find different materials to learn from, right?</p><p>Well, during this learning process, you'll discover that indoor growth requires one piece of very essential equipment: <a href="http://www.medicgrow.com/" target="_blank" title="Medic grow led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow light</a>. Since these plants are grown in-house, they need a LED grow light that can mimic sunlight and drive photosynthesis.</p><p>You will see that many lights call themselves "best grow light," but there are actually four main types of these lights: Fluorescent grow lights, MH, HPS Bulbs, and LED lights.</p><p>If you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="wikipedia grow light article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article about grow lights</a>, you'll find that LED&nbsp;lighting are by far the best ones. Needless to say, the first few traditional lamps have their own advantages; for example, they are cheap and can be bought just about anywhere. But their shortcomings are also obvious, like they emit too much heat, or the spectrum does not meet the needs of plants etc.</p><p>For some plants that require a lot of light to grow, those traditional lights&nbsp;can not compete with&nbsp;LED ones in some respects. In this blog we will list some basic knowledge on choosing a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;LED plant-growth lighting.</p></div>
<h2>8&nbsp;Key Features&nbsp;You Should Know About&nbsp;LED Grow Lights</h2>
<h3><strong>1. PAR</strong></h3>
<p>PAR stands for "photosynthetic active radiation". <span>&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>&nbsp;is a metric used for plants while lumens are for humans.&nbsp; So plants don't care how bright your light fixture appears to you.&nbsp;PAR in lighting is the wavelength within the visible range of 400 to 700 nanometers (nm), and plants use this range to&nbsp;photosynthesise or grow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/par-measurement.jpg?v=1605057977" alt="LED grow light PAR"></span></p>
<h3>
<br><strong>2. PPF&amp;PPFD</strong>
</h3>
<div><p>There are two phases related to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These are photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).</p><p>PPF simply describes the number of photons that led grow lamp produces in the PAR wavelength range within one second.</p></div>
<div><p>PPF is measured in units called micromoles (umol). You can use PPF to determine whether your grow light is "powerful enough" for your plants.</p><p>PPFD is the number of photons that hit the plant canopy in a given second. This is measured in micromoles (umols). The bigger of this value, the better.</p><p>The difference between PPF and PPFD is that PPF is the intensity of light when measured at the light source, while PPFD is the light intensity when measured at the surface of the plant.</p></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/ppf_and_ppfd_600x600.jpg?v=1605063210" alt="LED grow light PPF and PPFD"></p>
<h3>
<p><strong>3. Photon Efficacy</strong></p></h3>
<p>Photon efficacy is the measure of how well a light source produces visible light. The unit for efficacy is Joule per second (J/s). If you know the PPF and the input wattage of a light, you can easily calculate photon efficacy. The higher this number is, the more efficient a grow light is at converting electricity into photons. So be sure to check this out with a lighting manufacturer.</p>
<h3>
<br><strong>4. LED Chips</strong>
</h3>
<p><br>Chips are the most necessary and basic aspect of an LED grow lighting. Therefore, the manufacturing of chips must keep durability and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/products/IMG_20201023_152418_600x600.jpg?v=1604388543" alt="led chip"></p>
<div><p>The suitable LED chip will hardly show color inconsistency while maintaining voltage and intensity. A carefully crafted chip can produce effective and uniform LED lights that can support a variety of crops.</p><p>There are many LED chip brands you can pick from, such as Bridgelux, Philips, Epistar, CREE, or Osram. Among these, CREE and Osram are favored by many users due to their chip's durability and efficiency.</p></div>
<h3>
<br><strong>5. Spectrum</strong>
</h3>
<p>The spectrum refers to the electromagnetic wavelength of light generated by the light source to promote plant growth. In order to perform photosynthesis, plants use light in the PAR (photosynthesis active radiation) region, and the wavelength of this region (400nm-700nm) is measured in nanometers (nm).</p>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/spectrum_600x600.jpg?v=1605063737" alt="LED grow light full spectrum"></p><p>The LED lighting stimulates the colors of the sunlight range from red and yellow to blue and violet, and plants use this full spectrum to undergo the process of photosynthesis.</p><p>The red and blue lights are the most critical for plants. Blue is for the vegetative stage while red is for blooming.</p></div>
<p>Other wavelengths besides red and blue are also beneficial for certain phases of plant growth.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet helps protect the plants from insects and diseases, and a bit more infrared light than normal makes your plants think they are covered by something so they need to grow taller to get more light.</p>
<div><p>Green light can penetrate farther into plants leaves and farther below the canopy than other wavelengths.</p><p>The ideal spectrum can help accelerate vegetation, increase flowering, speed up growth, etc. Whether or not the light source is supplementary (as with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse" target="_blank" title="greenhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse</a>) or the sole one will also affect which light spectrum should be used.</p><p>Therefore, getting an LED grow light with a full spectrum for your indoor plants means that it provides all the wavelengths present in natural light. All you need to do is switch the amount of light exposure the plants need during the different growth phases.</p></div>

<h3><strong>6. Heat Dissipation</strong></h3>
<p>Although LEDs emit less heat than other traditional grow lights, putting many LEDs together, they still need a heat dispassion system to keep the body cool at all times. Some best LED lights on the market have a heat sink to release extra heat. That means no noisy fans, and no wasted electricity by powering them.</p>
<h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/Heat_Dissipation_600x600.jpg?v=1605065892" alt="LED grow light heat dissipation"><p><strong>7. Lighting Coverage</strong></p></h3>
<p>Each LED grow light you consider should have information regarding the lighting coverage. This refers to the coverage area, which is usually measured in square footage, of the light that falls onto the plants.</p>
<p>A good coverage area is essential, not only do the size and lenses of your LED grow light determine your coverage area, but so does hanging height. The further the distance between your lights and plants, the greater the footprint, but the lower the PPFD.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/led_grow_light_coverage_2_600x600.jpg?v=1605081160" alt="LED grow light coverage"></p>
<p>Let's say you have a lamp hanging at a 12-foot distance from your canopy. Then, you increase the hanging height to a distance of 24 feet. You will now have a light intensity that is&nbsp;much less of what it was before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it's very important to pay attention to hanging height and coverage area when selecting an LED light.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Wattage</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to LED grow-light wattage, this metric refers to two things. A 550w LED light can either indicate that it can truly pull 550w energy from the wall or it can deliver an equivalent power in brightness to a 550wMH/HID grow light.</p>
<p>So pay attention to exactly what is meant by an LED grow light's stated wattage. Our<a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-fold-8-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="fold 8 led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LED grow light</a> can actually deliver what it says online.</p>
<h2>
<br>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>If you're on a tight budget, you will need to pay attention to 1, 2, and 3. But if you have extra cash to spend, you can choose the best metric from 1 to 8. For indoor plants, artificial lighting is crucial as they have no access to natural sunlight.</p><p>Good lighting is an important factor that determines the yield of your plants as well as other factors, such as the strains you use and your planting experience etc.</p></div>
<p>If you focus on the above factors when picking an LED grow light, you can definitely get the best LED grow light for your plants. A suitable LED grow light will get the most bang for your buck when it comes to minimizing electrical costs while maximizing plant health.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">PIPEDA</abbr> Report of Findings #2020-004</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 28, 2020</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Overview</h2>
<p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (<abbr>OPC</abbr>), Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (<abbr>OIPC AB</abbr>) and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia (<abbr>OIPC BC</abbr>), collectively referred to as “the Offices” commenced a joint investigation<sup id="fn1-rf"><a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,<sup id="fn2-rf"><a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup> to examine whether The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited (<abbr>CFCL</abbr>) was collecting and using personal information of visitors to its Canadian malls, without valid consent, via:</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- i. -->Anonymous Video Analytics (<abbr>AVA</abbr>) technology installed in “wayfinding” directories; and</li>
<li><!-- ii. -->mobile device geolocation tracking technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our findings in respect of these two issues are detailed below.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> collected and used personal information, including sensitive biometric information, via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology without valid consent.</strong></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology: (i) took temporary digital images of the faces of any individual within the field of view of the camera in the directory (retained in computer memory briefly during processing); (ii) used facial recognition software to convert those images into biometric numerical representations of the individual faces (sensitive personal information that could be used to identify individuals based on their unique facial features); and (iii) used that information to assess age range and gender.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> represented that the numerical representations were not retained beyond processing. However, our investigation revealed that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> service provider had collected and stored approximately 5 million numerical representations of faces on <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> explained that it collected information via <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> for purposes of monitoring foot traffic patterns and predicting demographic information about mall visitors. We found no evidence that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> had used the biometric information, including any of the retained numerical representations, for identification purposes.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also retained approximately 16 hours of video recordings, some including audio, which it had captured during a calibration (or testing) phase of the technology at two malls.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> asserted that to the extent that it required consent, such consent was obtained via its privacy policy. We found that this was inadequate. Firstly, an individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender. As such, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> should have obtained express opt-in consent. Further, we reviewed <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy and determined that the language was overly broad, and buried in the middle of a 5,000 word document, which would not be easily accessible to individuals while they are engaging with a mall directory. We found that the privacy policy language was not sufficient to support meaningful consent for <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> practices.</p>
<p>Finally, we noted that while shoppers were directed, by stickers displayed at mall entrances, to visit guest services to obtain a copy of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy, when we asked a guest services employee at one of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s malls for that policy, they were confused by the request.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we made several recommendations. We recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> either: (i) obtain meaningful express opt-in consent and allow individuals to use its mall directories without having to submit to the collection and use of their sensitive biometric information; or (ii) cease use of its <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology. While <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> expressly disagreed with our findings, it advised that it had ceased use of the technology in July 2018, and that it had no current plans to resume that use. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> has also, pursuant to further recommendations by our Offices, deleted the numerical representations of faces and audio/video recordings in its possession which were not required for legal purposes. It has confirmed that what information has been retained will not be used for any other purposes outside of those required for compliance with the law. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also provided privacy-related training to guest services employees. As a result, we found the matter to be <strong>well-founded and resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Offices asked <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to provide a commitment to follow our recommendations with respect to ensuring valid consent if they were to resume use of <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology in the future. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> indicated that if it did resume use of the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology, it would obtain adequate consent, “in accordance with the applicable privacy legislation and consistent with the <em>Guidelines for obtaining meaningful consent</em>”. However, it refused to commit to obtaining <strong>express opt-in</strong> consent consistent with our recommendations. We find this concerning given that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> disagreed with our analysis and interpretation of the law in this case. For example, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> continues to maintain, contrary to our findings, that they were not collecting personal information via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> <em>did not</em> collect the location information of identifiable individuals via mobile device tracking technology in its malls, such that it did not require consent for the practice.</strong></p>
<p>We found that the information collected from mobile devices of shoppers, who were not logged into Wi-Fi in <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> malls, did not constitute personal information. More specifically, the hashed and randomized <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr> address (device identifier), coupled with non-granular “zone” geolocation information collected using Wi-Fi triangulation, did not constitute personal information in this context, as there was not a serious possibility that this information could be linked, either alone or with other available information, with the mobile device holder.</p>
<p>With respect to individuals who log in to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s free Wi-Fi service, via a process that required them to provide personal information, we originally understood, based on the evidence gathered during our investigation, including from <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> and its Wi-Fi service provider, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was collecting triangulated device geolocation information and linking it with identifiable device users’ Wi-Fi accounts. We therefore made certain preliminary recommendations to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> with respect to the consent we would expect for this practice. However, in response to a preliminary report issued by our Offices, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> clarified, and its third-party Wi-Fi service provider verified, that the geolocation information described above could not in any practical manner be associated with, or linked to, logged-in Wi-Fi accounts, such that it was not personal information in that context. We therefore determined the matter to be <strong>not well-founded</strong>.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was seeking consent for “special location-based offers”, despite the fact that it was not engaged in the practice. Further to our recommendation, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did remove such language from its privacy policy, and added language making clear what limited location information is collected and associated with Wi-Fi accounts (i.e., only the <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> property in question).</p>
<p>Finally, we note that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s third-party Wi-Fi service provider offers the option to associate triangulated “zone” information to accounts, and that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did include, in its privacy policy, the prospect of using geolocation information to deliver location-based offers. We therefore recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> commit to implementing our preliminary recommendations should it decide to activate this functionality and associate geolocation information with Wi-Fi accounts in future. Specifically, we would expect <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to: (i) support express consent for such geolocation practices via a clear and prominent notice on the Wi-Fi log-in page; and (ii) provide a clearly explained and easily accessible opt-out option. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> again refused, claiming that these recommendations were speculative.</p>
<h2 id="toc2">Background</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li><!-- 1. -->This report of investigation examines The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited’s (“<abbr>CFCL</abbr>”) compliance with Canada’s <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPEDA</abbr>”), Alberta’s’ <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA AB</abbr>”), and British Columbia’s <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA BC</abbr>”) – referred to collectively as the “Acts”.</li>
<li><!-- 2. --><abbr>CFCL</abbr> is one of the largest owners, operators and developers of offices, retail and mixed-use properties, including shopping malls, in North America.</li>
<li><!-- 3. -->This joint investigation was launched in the wake of numerous media reports that raised questions and concerns about whether <abbr>CFCL</abbr> was collecting, using and/or disclosing personal information using facial analytics technology, via in-mall directories, without adequate consent.

<p>Corporate Development, Strategic Business Development, Corporate Business Development, or any other amalgamation – are likely all the same teams with small caveats. Traditionally, CorpDev’s mandate was to buy companies. That’s traditional. But it’s 2020 and we can all attest that business models have changed over the past years. These days CorpDev isn’t simply a team being told from the top-down what to go find and buy. More often than not it’s an assortment of functions baked into a multi-faceted team who brings the outside-in, from education to execution. This takes the form of helping business lines execute strategic partnerships, take stakes in venture investments, and yes the vanilla M&amp;A. That team could also be tasked with helping draft corporate strategy by informing business unit leaders of emerging threats given their overweighted exposure to the startup ecosystem. It’s exciting work!</p>

<p>This is why it’s disappointing to hear people say ‘don’t talk to CorpDev unless you’re ready to sell.’ (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html" target="_blank">Enter Paul Graham’s essay</a>) It’s short-sighted. It’s akin to having a VC reach out to a founder, ask for a conversation, and the founder says, “no thanks, we’re not currently raising.” The most likely response from the VC would be, “cool, I wasn’t looking to invest but wanted to create a connection.” </p>



<p>All of it is a relationship-driven business.  Executing partnerships, investments and acquisitions are more likely to happen if you previously knew the founders or investors in advance. And you don’t need to wait to talk to VCs or CVCs or ‘CorpDev’ until you’re ready – talk to them when you have mutual interests that could be beneficial to both parties.  Talk to them when you’re looking to network.  Don’t wait to talk to them until, and only until you’re ready to begin a raise or be sold. If you do so there’s a chance you’ll get a response like the following, “thanks for reaching out and happy to still connect, but we just did X 3 months ago and would have loved to connect back then.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>CorpDev benefits regardless if their company grows through in-organic ways. And if it’s a legit team, they’re involved regardless in everything of strategic value that’s in-organic. Outside engagement with the startup ecosystem is what that usually looks like. Even more so, transactions in my experience have happened by having existing relationships. This is the same team sitting at the leadership table adjacent to the business unit heads with a purview into the organization’s strategy – they know the players involved, and what is necessary to get something executed. If they’re good, they’ll be frank on timing and engagement strategy. For example, “our process takes 5 weeks to execute from soup to nuts, and you’ll know in the next week if X is possible.”</p>



<p>Additionally, having pre-existing relationships with CorpDev can help outside startups and companies bypass red-tape or headaches. I see this a lot: a Series A-C startup working with an individual at the firm already for the past two months, only to find out that that person who’s ‘in’ the business needs to go through procurement which includes an RFP process to get a contract signed off on. That individual didn’t know because it was the first time they were engaged in something like that, regardless of their passionate intentions. What the startup’s sales executive thought would be signing of the account in a quarter quickly turned into a 12-18 month procurement process that they now have the chance of losing. This usually comes to fruition as pen needs to be signed to paper and the individual who ushered them in is not the individual who’ll be signing off on the $50,000 PoC to test validity leading to production.</p>



<p>Having a contact at the firm’s CorpDev team can always quickly hash something like the aforementioned out over a 15-minute phone call at the beginning, providing a black and white picture of what they should expect and the best way to close. CorpDev understands who’s inside the organization.  CorpDev can help ‘herd the sheep’.  And if they’re good (respected) CorpDev can influence without direct authority.</p>



<p>Talk to CorpDev.   Talk to them when you’re curious.   Talk to them when you’re about to start raising.   Talk to them when you’re kicking off direct sales, auctions, and more.   Don’t wait. </p>

    <p>In my previous article about <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the number of built-in apps in iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Several readers asked if I could provide a percentage rather than an absolute number.</p>
<p>In this new article, I will answer this question by measuring the total number of binaries in iOS. I will go one step further and also count the number of binaries using other programming languages: Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Finally to be as complete as possible, I ran this analysis on all major iOS releases, from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14. This will provide a detailed overview of the evolution of the different programming languages over more than a decade of iOS development.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the analysis, let's clarify the scope. First I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares (SecureROM, Baseband, …) are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a cache mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 and still used in iOS&nbsp;14.</p>
<p>Another point is that you may note the absence of Objective-C++. The approach I used can't really detect binaries using Objective-C++. So I counted such binaries as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
<p>Finally you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations due to the simple fact that I don't have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>

<p>The first problem to tackle was to count the number of binaries in iOS. Because I ran the analyses off‑device, I could not rely on the permissions being properly set.</p>
<p>Instead I used the fact that a binary has to be a Mach-O file to be executable. Checking if a file is a Mach-O binary is trivial by using the <code>file</code> command line tool in a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function to check if a file (passed as argument $1) is an executable
# It returns the number of occurrences of the string 'Mach-O' returned by
# the output of the file command. File would generally return a line like
# - Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e (/usr/bin/sysdiagnose)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64e (/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib)
# - Mach-O 64-bit bundle arm64e (/usr/lib/xpc/support.bundle/support)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamic linker arm64e (/usr/lib/dyld)
# - Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle arm64e (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext/AppleIDV)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library stub arm64e (/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/libMobileGestalt.dylib)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
isExecutable ()
{
	file $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o "Mach-O" | wc -l
}
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this script through all the files of each major iOS release to count the number of binaries and to obtain the evolution over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/Binaries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 contained quite a small amount of binaries. But iOS has become more and more complex and iOS&nbsp;14.0 now contains 20 times more binaries than iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0.</p>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the built-in apps using Swift and SwiftUI. For this article I decided to go one step further and also count the number of binaries using Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can mix different programming languages to create a binary. One example is to create an app that uses C++ for the low-level engine and Objective-C for the UI. Another good example is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> where I use some code written in Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C and C, the most appropriate programming languages being used to solve each specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swiftui">Detecting SwiftUI</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">previous post</a>, I explained how to detect if a binary uses SwiftUI by checking if it dynamically links against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>. This can be implemented in a Bash script like:</p>
<pre><code>isSwiftUI=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI\.framework/SwiftUI" | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<p>Although SwiftUI is not really a programming language but rather an user interface toolkit, I decided to include it in this article.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swift">Detecting Swift</h2>
<p>Detecting the use of Swift can be done using a similar method, as <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">described in an older post in 2016</a>. The script is however slightly more complex due to the fact that the Swift libraries have been moved to different locations during the history of iOS:</p>
<pre><code>isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/swift/" | wc -l )
if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ]
then
	# On iOS 11, the Swift dylib were inside "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/"
	isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/" | wc -l )
	
	if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ] &amp;&amp; [[ $1 != */libswiftUIKit.dylib ]]
	then
		# On iOS 9, the Swift dylib were built into the app
		isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "@rpath/libswiftUIKit\.dylib" | wc -l )
	fi
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-objective-c">Detecting Objective-C</h2>
<p>Detecting if a binary uses Objective-C is pretty simple as explained in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Apple's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language, and as such is linked to by all Objective-C apps. Objective-C runtime library support functions are implemented in the shared library found at /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple line can thus detect all apps using Objective-C:</p>
<pre><code>isObjectiveC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libobjc\." | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c">Detecting C++</h2>
<p>Similarly to Objective-C, we can rely on the fact that apps using C++ have to use the C++ standard library. On modern iOS versions, the C++ standard library libc++ is located at <code>/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib</code>. On iOS&nbsp;7 and earlier, the gcc's libstdc++ was used and located at <code>/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why the exact path is not used in the script below, the reason is to mark <code>libc++abi.dylib</code> as using C++. <a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/">libc++abi</a> is the low level support for the standard C++ library and appears to be written in C++.</p>
<pre><code>isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libc++" | wc -l )
if [ ${isCPP} == 0 ]
then
	isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libstdc++" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c-1">Detecting C</h2>
<p>Without entering into complex details, Objective-C and C++ are a superset of C. This means that an Objective-C or C++ app is using C code. So we can't know if an Objective-C or C++ app is using some pure C code. However some apps are written entirely in C. These are generally low-level command line tool, like <code>/usr/bin/zprint</code>.</p>
<p>How to detect such binaries? If a binary doesn't link neither to the Objective-C runtime library nor to the C++ standard library, but uses the standard C library <code>libc</code> located at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>, then we can assume that this binary is entirely written in C. To detect apps entirely written in C, I ended up with these lines:</p>
<pre><code>isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libSystem\." | wc -l )
if [ ${isC} == 0 ]
then
	isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/system/" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that I hardcoded all the dynamic libraries located inside <code>/usr/lib/system/</code> as being written in C. These low-level libraries don't link to <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> but are most likely written in C.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases">Special cases</h2>
<p>In the final script, you will see a couple of special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib</code>:
This library is entirely written in assembly and you can read its arm64 source code in this file <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-781/runtime/objc-blocktramps-arm64.s">objc-blocktramps-arm64.s</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/dyld</code>:
dyld is the dynamic linker and is a really special binary. Since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/">it is open source</a>, we can easily confirm that it contains C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpc/sdk.dylib</code> and <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib</code>:
These 2 libraries seem to be autogenerated libraries and part of dyld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Extensions/*</code>:
There are a couple of (kernel?) extension used by iOS like <code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext</code>. All these binaries appear to use C++.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/detectBinaries.sh">download here the complete script</a> that loops through all the files of a folder. This script prints the paths of all the binaries found and tells you the programming languages used, like:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/AccountAuthenticationDialog |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/ActivityMessagesApp |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/PlugIns/ActivityMessagesExtension.appex/ActivityMessagesExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/AnimojiStickers |Objective-C
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/PlugIns/AnimojiStickersExtension.appex/AnimojiStickersExtension |Objective-C
/Applications/AppSSOUIService.app/AppSSOUIService |Objective-C
/Applications/AppStore.app/AppStore |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/ProductPageExtension.appex/ProductPageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/SubscribePageExtension.appex/SubscribePageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this script on all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14.0. If you are interested by the raw data, you can download them here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>A few months back I was running down the San Francisco Bay, looking out over the dry docks and concrete factories, pondering organization structures… as you do.</p><p>I was wrestling with two pieces of seemingly contradictory management advice:</p><ol><li>In order to optimize communication structures, particularly in fast-paced environments, organizations should remain as flat as possible.</li><li>Managers shouldn’t have too many reports, if you want them to be able to adequately support their team.</li></ol><p>Having worked in a range of different sized organizations the first piece of advice intuitively resonated. As you add layers of hierarchy, coordination becomes more complex and information gaps start to emerge. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “<a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/iceberg-of-ignorance/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Iceberg of Ignorance</a>,” where executives only see 4% of the problems experienced by front-line staff. So, aiming to reduce hierarchy where possible made sense.</p><p>But how do you balance that with the second piece of advice? If you reduce the number of direct reports each manager has, you inherently increase the depth of the hierarchy.</p><p>Experience from managing a team that grew from 20 to 60 told me that managers should really work with fewer than 8 reports, and that’s assuming no other responsibilities. If you’re expected to spend time coding, for example, I felt that it should be no more than five. But, having recently talked to a couple of managers with 25 reports each, I was starting to worry I was off base and wondered whether companies were in reality favoring high number of reports and flat org charts.</p><p>I resolved to gather more data, and went out to my network on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><h3>Lucky Sevens</h3><p>I sent out a Google Form and after a couple of weeks had 129 responses. The majority came from people in leadership roles: 15 CXOs, 17 VPs, 26 directors, 42 managers. Many were from engineering functions — though there were a number of designers and people ops folks.</p><p>Responses spanned startups, public companies, and not-for-profits, with the largest segment being “growth stage” startups. One-third of respondents were at companies with under 150 people, while 10 were from 70,000+ person organizations.</p><p>It turned out that the average number of reports for both respondents and the respondent’s manager was 7, with a standard deviation of 5. Directors came in slightly higher than other roles with an average of 9 reports.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/54e1aa9e9da8ce47df281654551a12c22b372f8f-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Average reports"></p><p>The biggest surprise was that when asked about the ideal number of reports — not for themselves, but as a general rule of thumb — the average was also 7, with a standard deviation of only 2.</p><p>This answer was pretty consistent across roles, with only CXOs and ICs offering a slightly lower number of around 6 reports per manager — which is perhaps a function of experience. When I dug deeper into these numbers, It wasn’t that people were self-reporting their own situation as being ideal, but on average it did mean that for this dataset the status quo was somewhat close to the perceived ideal.</p><blockquote>Across seniority levels, people reported that seven was the ideal number of reports and that 11 was an upper limit for most situations.</blockquote><p>In terms of maximum number of reports, most felt that 10 to 12 was an upper limit, with ICs reporting that 8 or 9 was the maximum number for a manager to be effective.</p><div><section><div><div><div><h3>Keep your team better connected</h3><p>Sign up for the Range newsletter</p></div></div></div></section></div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/ce6a95de968e00fde739deae8430b437aa305ffc-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Max reports"></p><h3>Nitty-gritty</h3><p>Many respondents noted that these “magic numbers” lack nuance.</p><p>There are no absolute rules and situational factors need to be considered when identifying the ideal ratio for your team: type of work, team structure, seniority of managers, how much hands-on work the manager is expected to contribute, etc.</p><p>Kean Wong, former VP Software Engineering at Pebble said:</p><blockquote>_Reporting relationships and the number of sustainable direct reports are directly related to the company structure, culture, size, and the team dynamics, and the other responsibilities of the manager. The magic number, skills and structures that worked effectively at Palm, Facebook, Pebble, Intel varied dramatically, and the number I could effectively manage also depended on factors like the locality of my reports and their teams, and my own responsibilities to the broader organization. This is why there is no single magic number of reports that works for every situation._</blockquote><p>Some respondents felt that senior reports required less attention, which would therefore give managers more capacity. Though several explicitly called this out as a common myth, including this Director of Engineering at a 200 person startup:</p><blockquote>_While some reports are "easy" it doesn't mean that you can lump on more and more reports. I find that easy and hard reports all need about the same amount of time just to ensure they are getting the attention and support they need._</blockquote><p>There are other practical constraints. Jason Goldman — former Chief Digital Officer for the White House — pointed out that 1:1s are a cornerstone managerial technique in modern organizations, and thus quickly becomes the most constraining factor.</p><p>Eight 30 minute 1:1s a week consumes 10% of your work week. It is possible to switch to every other week, but at around 12 to 15 even this starts to fall apart. Jason went on to say that he strongly believes that once you’re no longer having regular 1:1s with someone you’re not actually managing them.</p><h3>Doing the calculus</h3><p>Going back to the original question that plagued me during my dock-side run, how do these data points on manager reporting ratios affect organizational depth?</p><p>Using the above rule of thumb, let’s say that we want our leaders to average 7 direct reports. New managers may have 2-3 reports, while some managers will end off closer to 10 or 11 reports before needing to delegate some of their responsibilities.</p><p>With these ratios a team can get to nearly 60 people with two layers of management: VPE → Manager → Engineer. In my experience, this can still feel pretty flat, if you are intentional about communication and planning. Adding a Director layer gets you to 400 people, by which point you've crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" rel="noopener" target="_self">Dunbar number</a> and are dealing with a whole new set of issues.</p><p>For larger organizations, the challenge really becomes how and when to subdivide in order to provide a feeling of alignment and cohesion. Four layers of management will get you to nearly 3,000 people, but this number of people laddering up to a single business unit or product division will cause alignment and communication issues that go beyond those that stem from just the deep management chain.</p><h3>Alternative reality</h3><p>When I joined Google in 2005 I reported to a Director with over a hundred direct reports. This certainly made the reporting hierarchy look flat, but the org chart didn’t reflect reality. Multiple products rolled up to this Director. I was on Gmail, and we broke out into backend and frontend teams; I think at that stage there was also a dedicated SRE team and a delivery team.</p><p>While situations such as this are hopefully relegated to historical anecdotes, it is increasingly true that the org chart does not reflect the real work. Teams are becoming increasingly cross-functional and it is becoming common for individuals to contribute to multiple efforts.</p><p>This is leading more companies to decouple their organizational structure from the management hierarchy. Which in turn is making it possible to maintain a relatively flat team hierarchy — or “hierarchy of purpose” — while ensuring supportive management structures are also in place.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Organizing people is hard, it’s a constant process of balancing different trade-offs and there really is no one size fits all solution. But there are principles, discovered through others’ real world experiences, we should learn from.</p><p>So if you see a manager with more than eight reports ask yourself: is this situation really serving everyone? And it may be that you need to look for other solutions to the communication challenges posed by deeper hierarchies.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/compound-returns-engineering-excellence">here</a>.</p>

<p>I see a lack of honesty in our industry when we share knowledge. Every post is intented to sell the legend because we are as great as the legend we create.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to be honest and share with you a simple initiative I’m trying out with my team. My objective is to solve some of the problems we have and improve our <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-engineering-excellence">What is Engineering Excellence?</h2>

<p>The truth is… nobody really knows. So nobody will give you a right answer. I went on <a href="https://twitter.com/stanete">twitter</a> and asked the community, I read a bunch of Medium posts and I had conversations with other technical leaders. Only to arrive at the conclusion that <strong>Engineering Excellence can only be improved; it cannot be achieved</strong>.</p>

<p>I found out that <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong> is about how a <em>Product Engineering</em> team approaches problems, breaks them into steps that add value, implements those steps and learns from how the solution is performing at a <em>Business</em>, <em>Product</em> and <em>Engineering</em> level. In three words: plan, build and learn.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Compound Returns on Engineering Excellence</strong> is just a mental model. A metaphor. A way of giving meaning to my quest of trying to improve my team by telling an interesting story. Compounding is about taking advantage of the returns your investments already generate by reinvesting them again. In other words, <a href="https://www.elkinvest.com/blog/compounding-returns-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-use-it-or-lose-it">compounding</a> is where you earn a return on returns that are already earned and reinvested.</p>

<p>With time, an <em>Engineering</em> team will improve their practices and systems if well though improvements are implemented. Every consecutive improvement will benefit from the last one. You must find your own story and give it the meaning your team needs. I work at a fintech so <em>compounding</em> seemed the right metaphor for us.</p>

<h2 id="its-dangerous-to-go-alone">It’s dangerous to go alone!</h2>

<p>In the the very first cave of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, an old man says: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_dangerous_to_go_alone!">It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this</a>. He gives Link a sword to help him on his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue Princess Zelda.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_thinking.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is no way you can accurately find out what the team needs to improve by yourself. I picked up three of the people I trust most. They don’t have to be the most Senior Engineers; they only have to be people others can look at and see as role models. They will help you find out what the team needs to improve. They will also help you create a plan, lead initiatives and inspire others to join in your quest.</p>

<p>But before starting the journey, I shared the initiative with the people I trust. I tried to enlist them, make space for them so they can grow and that way I tried to build trust. You do that last one by being honest and transparent about the problems you will encounter on your jorney.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve?</h2>

<p>There are many ways you can lead the people you have chosen to help you find it out. But the main idea is drawn from the <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/">Design Sprint</a> methodology: diverge and converge. You need to find spaces where you can together explore many possibilities, find out what others think, set clear objectives, ask for feedback, give everyone a role and make decisions. Other book that talks about how to approach a problem as a team, explore possible solutions and make a decision is <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Mastering-Collaboration-Working-Together-Productive/dp/1492041734">Mastering Collaboration: Make Working Together Less Painful and More Productive</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence_diagram.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will lead one initiative yourself to give example. But each one of those people you’ve chosen will also lead one. This is important because it will allow them to shine, inspire and involve other members of the team. Leading does not mean doing. It means persuing, involving others and making sure it happens.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-improving">What are we improving?</h2>

<p>After a couple of weeks of brainstorming, debating, analysing and asking for feedback, we decided to focus on three aspects we must improve in the short term:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Vertical Continuous Delivery</em>. The team’s ability to break big problems into small pieces so every step makes sense, adds value and reduces risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Quality</em>. The team’s ability and processes to build simple yet testable, readable, maintainable and evolvable code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Observability &amp; Monitoring</em>. The team’s mindset to think and learn about what happens to the code after it is in one of the dark corners of the internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The journey is broken down into three phases: <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shu-Ha-Ri</a>. Nobody <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">explains this</a> better than Martin Fowler so I’m not going to even try to do a better job.</p>

<p>Every team needs to improve different aspects of its <em>Engineering Excellence</em> throughout its life. Your team will have to follow its own path and battle its own demons.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/shu_ha_ri.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Make sure you have checkpoints along the journey so you can adjust your plans for the needs your team has. Also, make sure you can escape from the chaos and day to day histeria so you can have some time to think and reflect on the changes happening because this initiative.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong">What could possibly go wrong?</h2>

<p>Everything. One of the most famous quotes in business is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you’re starting to improve your team’s <em>Engineering Excellence</em> but you are not <a href="https://leaddev.com/scaling-software-systems/primer-engineering-delivery-metrics">measuring</a> anything yet (quantitatively or qualitatively)? Keep going. You don’t have time to measure first and improve later. You’ll need to do both at the same time. Actually, make the team understand why <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/can-you-measure-developer-productivity/">measuring themsleves is so damn important</a> as part of the journey.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_bunny.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you know something about <em>Engineering</em> teams and people in general you know there is no guarantee this initiative will succeed. But I would love to have a chat if you try this or something similar.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-when-you-finish">What to do when you finish?</h2>

<p>You never finish. When you do, if you do, you start over. But make sure you assess your team has actually improved their <em>Engineering Excellence</em> from time to time.</p>

<div>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>There are tons of interview myths floating around about the technical hiring process, mostly because it’s usually a black box to candidates. The inherent stress, inexperienced interviewers, tiring challenges, and unresponsive companies are valid reasons for candidates to have a negative view of hiring. Some of these myths work against a good interview experience and the candidates’ chances to get hired, so I’d like to call them out and refute them.</p>
<h2 id="about-me"><span id="About_me">About me</span></h2>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. I’ve been supporting software engineers for 6+ years, working with ~40 engineers as their engineering manager. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in <a href="https://ochronus.online/acing-the-tech-interview/">my guide to ace technical interviews.</a></p>
<h2 id="now-let-s-see-the-myths-and-misconceptions-"><span id="Now_lets_see_the_technical_interview_myths_and_misconceptions">Now let’s see the technical interview myths and misconceptions.</span></h2>
<h3 id="you-can-never-be-late-"><span id="You_can_never_be_late">You can never be late.</span></h3>
<p>Without question, do you best to be at your interview on time and plan things accordingly, but don’t worry, we know sh*it happens. If you can please let us know you’ll be late or you’d like to reschedule the interview, I promise you it’ll be fine. Nobody in their right mind would try to relate whether you were punctual or not on a single occasion to your future job performance.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-do-research-ahead-of-time-because-the-interviewer-will-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-"><span id="Dont_do_research_ahead_of_time_because_the_interviewer_will_tell_you_everything_you_need_to_know">Don’t do research ahead of time because the interviewer will tell you everything you need to know.</span></h3>
<p>False, for two reasons. While your interviewer will do their best to give you all the information&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;think is essential for you, there’s no way of exactly knowing what that is! The other reason is that if you don’t know anything about the company and the role, you’ll seem like someone who doesn’t care where they work and what they do. You probably don’t want that. You don’t need to overdo it and spend hours looking up who the founders’ grandparents were. Just make sure you understand the company’s market, look at the product(s) we offer (if you have time and you’re interested, even try them – we all love feedback!), and read the job description.</p>
<h3 id="they-are-looking-for-the-perfect-candidate-"><span id="They_are_looking_for_the_perfect_candidate">They are looking for the perfect candidate.</span></h3>
<p>No, we aren’t. We’re looking for a reasonably competent candidate with the right mindset who’s willing to take this journey of constant growth with us.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-ok-to-send-a-follow-up-email-after-my-interview-"><span id="Its_not_OK_to_send_a_follow-up_email_after_my_interview">It’s not OK to send a follow-up email after my interview.</span></h3>
<p>Sure it is! I even tell candidates explicitly to feel free to reach out to me if they have further questions or feedback! I really do value when folks reach out. I don’t mean “thank you” emails, but actual questions or feedback. Please, no brown-nosing, though – that’s really awkward for both of us and won’t get you anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="they-make-candidates-wait-a-lot-so-they-can-weigh-them-against-each-other-"><span id="They_make_candidates_wait_a_lot_so_they_can_weigh_them_against_each_other">They make candidates wait a lot so they can weigh them against each other.</span></h3>
<p>Hell, no we don’t! One quality of a good hiring process is that it should be able to help us decide whether we want to hire that specific candidate independently of others or not. As a hiring manager, I always do the interviews with my mind being set on that if we’re a good match, an offer is going out (unless, of course, headcounts changed in the meantime, but then we communicate that). If you’re waiting too long for us to come back to you, please, by all means, ping us! We might have dropped the ball somewhere – maybe someone is out sick and didn’t have time to ask others to help out, or we simply forgot something. It happens and we’re sorry – don’t assume malice, ask us, please. We should be proactively telling you when you can expect to hear from us and about the next steps, by the way! We do our best to keep those promises.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters-ghost-me-because-i-performed-badly-in-the-interview-"><span id="Recruiters_ghost_me_because_I_performed_badly_in_the_interview">Recruiters ghost me because I performed badly in the interview.</span></h3>
<p>While I can’t speak on behalf of all recruiters, in my experience, this is not the case! It should not happen. Sure, mistakes happen (recruiters are, believe it or not, humans, too), but the norm is that you get a timely answer whatever the interview outcome was. If you’re not getting that, ping them. Or ping the hiring manager. Probably someone dropped the ball on something. It happens. Ideally, we should be telling you when to expect us to come back to you, so you can know if we’re late or you’re just impatient 😉 – if you’re not getting that information from us, just ask at the end of the interview.</p>
<h3 id="if-my-interviewer-is-having-a-bad-day-i-will-probably-fail-the-interview-"><span id="If_my_interviewer_is_having_a_bad_day_I_will_probably_fail_the_interview">If my interviewer is having a bad day, I will probably fail the interview.</span></h3>
<p>Hopefully not. Sure, we are all humans, and our mood influences how we think and act, but a well-designed hiring process should protect against this. Unless I’m actively malicious (and why would I be?! I WANT to hire engineers!), my bias will be called out by other interviewers in the same step or another step, and I’ll need to argue for not hiring you. Honestly, even a good scorecard (the thing we fill out with some standard, guiding questions after the interview) will make me realize I’m just in a bad mood and then I can deal with it. If you only meet 1-2 interviewers during your process, the risk of bias is much higher. While you have no control over who interviews you, you can take a hint from this. While the scene might not yet be 100% rosy, companies are trying their best to stay competitive in the job market, and more and more realize that structured, unbiased, and humane interviews are one key to this.</p>

<h3 id="smaller-companies-blindly-copy-faang-hiring-methods-"><span id="Smaller_companies_blindly_copy_FAANG_hiring_methods">Smaller companies blindly copy FAANG hiring methods.</span></h3>
<p>Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google have some (in)famous hiring methods. While some companies probably blindly copy those, most don’t. It’d be stupid. They play on a different field with different goals and have a much higher volume of candidate influx. One example is focusing on algorithm and data structure knowledge – most FAANG technical interviews test this. It probably makes sense for them while it doesn’t make much sense for most other companies. Not only that, but it can have a negative effect (other than scaring away good candidates) – being biased towards two kinds of applicants: engineers who are working a lot with algorithms and data structures and fresh graduates, who still have muscle memory of this.</p>
<h3 id="culture-fit-we-want-people-exactly-like-us-"><span id="Culture_fit_we_want_people_exactly_like_us">Culture fit == we want people exactly like us.</span></h3>
<p>When we say “cultural fit”, we mean “value/principle fit”. I try to say that, by default, but industry terms die hard. We’re looking for teammates who believe in most of the same basic principles as we do, that’s all. Some examples of these principles are (for us, here at Contentful): transparency, growth mindset, customer focus and teamwork. I can reason why these are important and how they also relate to job performance and how they lead to a happy and scalable organization. It’s not fluffy stuff.</p>
<h3 id="my-resume-is-really-important-"><span id="My_resume_is_really_important">My resume is really important.</span></h3>
<p>Yes and no – yes, to get your foot in the door. It’s also a conversation starter but I’ll be interested in your stories instead when we talk. I look at resumes of candidates already in the loop only to find more information about them – things to talk about, to get some context. One thing about your resume though – it is also a piece of work from you, a signal for me. If it is seriously lacking in some aspect (eg it has serious spelling mistakes), I may see it as a sign of you not paying attention to your work’s quality or not asking for feedback (for someone to review it). By the way, there’s an excellent new book from Gergely Orosz in town about engineering resumes that can help you stand out to the next recruiter or hiring manager –&nbsp;<a href="https://thetechresume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tech Resume Inside Out</a>. If you don’t have too much time for this, just update your LinkedIn profile (a good move anyway!) and export your CV from LinkedIn – it is going to be much better than if you try to put it together in one evening alone.</p>

<p>You might think we’ll feel you’re not dedicated to us – but why would you be?! We just started talking 🙂 Nobody’s expecting you to focus on one company! On the other hand, if we really like you and you signal urgency we’ll have the chance to speed things up or even be more generous with our offer to convince you to join us 😉</p>

<p>Yup, after a few hundred interview sessions I still practice conversations in my head, I still worry I’ll make a bad impression and that I’ll mess things up. Many other people you will meet are doing much fewer interviews than me. I’m representing both myself and my company in each and every interview.

<p>Nobody in the hiring process will think of you like that! Trust me on this one. And yes, please do try again! The fact that you made it to the Nth step this time means that we see potential in you. If you reach out I’m more than happy to give tips and advice on where and how to grow.</p>

<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, …</p></div></div></article></div>

    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <amp-auto-ads type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1298191191396779" i-amphtml-layout="container"></amp-auto-ads><p>One problem with all the trials of statins is that they look at the probability of still being alive after x years. But that’s not really the question patients want answered. Patients want to know how much longer they can expect to live if they take a statin every day for the rest of their lives. Is it weeks? months? years? decades?</p><p>Considering that statins do have known side effects, with muscle pain being the most common and widely recognized, and considering that many people think it’s annoying to have to take a pill every day, they generally want to know the size of the benefit before they decide whether to take the drug or not. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is hard to extrapolate from the studies, due to the way in which they have been designed. Saying that a drug decreases your risk of dying by x over five years doesn’t really tell you anything about how much longer you can actually expect to live.</p><p>In 2015, a group of researchers looked at the data from the statin trials and re-calculated the effect in terms of increased longevity. The <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007118.long" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study was published in the British Medical Journal</a>, and it was funded by the University of Southern Denmark. One of the authors had significant conflicts of interest, having received money from multiple different pharmaceutical companies that produce statins.</p><p>All randomized trials comparing statins to placebo, and that also fulfilled the following three criteria, were included: They had to have at least 1,000 participants, they had to follow patients for at least two years, and they had to provide a survival curve. The reason a survival curve was necessary was because the increase in longevity was extrapolated by calculating the area between the survival curves for the statin group and the placebo group. I think the other two criteria are also reasonable – statin studies looking at mortality with less than 1,000 participants and that don’t even follow patients for two years are leaving too much up to chance.</p><p>The authors identified eleven studies that fulfilled the criteria, of which six were investigating statins for primary prevention (i.e. to treat people without known atherosclerotic disease) and five were investigating statins for secondary prevention (i.e. to treat people who had already had heart attacks, or in some other way clearly manifested atherosclerotic disease). These eleven studies together included a total of 92,135 patients, so the data are robust. Participants in the studies were followed for between two and six years. Most of the major statin trials (4S, WOSCOPS, ALLHAT, LIPID, ASCOT-LLA, JUPITER) were included in the analysis.</p><p>So what were the results?</p><p>Life was prolonged by between -5 and 19 days in the primary prevention trials (yes, that’s -5, as in minus five. In one of the studies people taking a statin lived five days shorter than people taking a placebo). In the secondary prevention trials life was prolonged by between -10 and 27 days (yes, again that’s -10, as in minus ten).</p><p>When everything is averaged out, people taking a statin for primary prevention lived three days longer than people in the placebo group. People taking a statin for secondary prevention lived four days longer than people in the placebo group. The average follow-up period in these studies was around four years, so if you assume that statins have a linear life-prolonging effect that grows with time (rather than petering off after a while, which is likely), then you can expect to live around one day longer for each year of treatment.</p><p>Huh? That’s disappointing. You take a drug dutifully, which your doctor has told you is vitally important, and it prolongs your life by mere days. The results are especially disappointing when you consider that most of the eleven trials were industry funded, and industry funded trials usually show better results than are seen in the real world. So most likely the real world benefit is even smaller than the tiny benefit found in these trials.</p><p>And remember, this analysis was done by people with financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. If even people who are friendly with industry say that statins only prolong life by mere days, we can probably trust that the benefit really is that tiny.</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, statins are not completely free of side effects. So even if you are willing to take a drug every day that has an extremely marginal effect on longevity, then that benefit needs to be weighed against the risk of side effects.</p><p>You might also enjoy my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/07/28/do-statins-save-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether statins save lives</a>, or my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/08/is-the-cholesterol-hypothesis-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether the cholesterol hypothesis is dead</a>.</p><section id="blog_subscription-17"></section><div><div><p> I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden.

November 15, 2020 | https://kennysong.github.io/adversarial.js/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kennysong.github.io/adversarial.js/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Getting Things Done</h3><p><time datetime="2020-11-09"><small>9 Nov, 2020</small></time></p><p>I'm writing this blog post at 21:45 on a weekday after an intense day at work and a full evening of looking after my daughter and cooking pizza. I was in three video conferences and chatted with two colleagues in Teams, all while having my kid run around me all day because the daycare is closed. Now's the time to do something for <strong>me</strong>. Wouldn't it be nice to have some help to juggle all these different things and not feel overwhelmed?</p><p>In the next weeks, I'm trying out the Getting Things Done (GTD for short) method. I have tried GTD for short periods off and on over some years. Without knowing the concept, I used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> but abandoned it after some time. That was over 10 years in my studies. A few years back, I read the original book and re-read it last year. So why try again? Didn't I learn my lesson?</p><p>No - I didn't :-). Although I've never completely adopted it, I've soaked up more and more of its practices. This time around I'll try to apply <em>all</em> its techniques as well as I can and see where that leads me.</p><h2 id="gtd-in-a-nutshell">GTD in a nutshell</h2><p>Quoted with small changes from the book:</p><ol><li>Capture all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you - now, later, someday, big little, or in between -- in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.</li><li>Direct yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.</li><li>Curate and coordinate all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play at any point in time.</li></ol><p>There are already many concise and complete introductions to the basics of GTD, so I won't repeat them here. Read <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">Erlend Hamberg's well-structured one: GTD in 15 minutes</a>. It's a quick and well-written guide.</p><p>In a sense, GTD is very American because I have the feeling (North) Americans are obsessed with lists. Many clickbait articles you come across have titles like "top X things" where X is more often than not simply the number somebody came up with. Although I must admit the last example was from a German site <a href="https://t3n.de/news/wordpress-hosting-anbieter-vergleich-604474/">13 WordPress-Anbieter</a>.</p><p>GTD has a list of the next actions one wants to look at. This is different from a todo list in that there are stricter rules on what a good entry can be. For example, it has to be a physical action and not a whole project. GTD also prescribes reviews (every day and every week) to keep on top of these lists. There's a comfort to know you'll triage a pressing question or inspiring article the next day or at least at your weekly review. This relief is at the heart of GTD: knowing that nothing will fall through the cracks you can relax from time to time.</p><p>One pays for a generally more relaxed general outlook by following a couple of small practices very closely. To capture all things, David Allen means that all emails or collected snippets are processed and collected too. I found it especially significant that one should collect references and notes on everything that might come in handy later. Collecting things comes <strong>very</strong> naturally to me; as a kid, I liked to collect buttons -- of all things -- and to keep many books around. When at long last I got my own computer I immediately started collecting <em>all the things</em>. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> accounts probably had more than a thousand collected links when it was shut down. GTD emphasizes to collect references for later usage. A lot of input is not useful at the moment and only potentially later at some point, but still, you can rely on your system to keep it for you.</p><h2 id="is-gtd-for-everybody%3F">Is GTD for everybody?</h2><p>David Allen originally "discovered" it in his work as a consultant and executive coach. I would argue that it's useful when you're already pretty organized. If you're in a routine job with little need for interaction with others it might be overkill for you. A simple todo list and some basic tricks to fight procrastination could be enough. There are fewer and fewer routine jobs. Most office workers are expected to be as "agile" when shifting many responsibilities as executives two decades ago.</p><h2 id="besides-gtd">Besides GTD</h2><p>In summary, I've mentioned that a convenient "setup" serves me better than vague "hacks". It can increase motivation and/or remove distractions. For my productivity, I still find it crucial to avoid news sites as much as possible. I've replaced them with a collection of RSS feeds from newspapers and some blogs. With a configured update interval of four hours, refreshing it every few minutes is less attractive. Turning off communication tools, the popular Pomodoro technique or simply walking to another room, still help me. I like that you can still apply many other ideas and still refine my <em>personal</em> system. If I had <strong>nothing</strong> to procrastinate on, that would be sad too, right?</p><p>I think getting rid of distractions is more important than having the perfect productivity system/todo tool. Cal Newport's ideas from his books (especially <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">"Deep Work"</a> and <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">"Digital Minimalism"</a>) and his <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> immediately come to mind. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/everyday-systems/">Here are some ideas from developer Tania Rascia</a> that I can relate to.</p><h2 id="how-to-implement-gtd">How to Implement GTD</h2><p>You have to decide if you want to go analog or digital. David Allen suggests in his book to keep lists and folders analog first. Digital tools realize GTD with more or less sophistication. I've never tried to use only paper although I tried working a lot with my Moleskine notebook. At some point, I had also used Things but only used it as a fancy todo list.</p><p>For me a very text-centric simple note-taking app called <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a> has worked well. It lets me write lists in different files synced between my laptop and smartphone. It's not very adapted to GTD but I like that it is an excellent reference system too. nvUltra is the commercial successor to the excellent open-source <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. This in turn evolved from <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. There are also cross-platform implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvPY</a>.</p><p><a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done">todoist</a> is a sophisticated tool for GTD too. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> has been around very long and has been refreshed over time. Other general-purpose note-taking tools can be adapted for GTD too, such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote. <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an alternative plain text file format that's more powerful than Markdown. It's mostly used with the Emacs editor and supports notes and todos as well.</p><h2 id="gtd-horizons">GTD horizons</h2><p>One distinguishing feature of GTD on top of todo management is more abstract and longer-term levels of focus. rom the day-to-day "ground" level, David Allen introduces the level of longer projects at horizon 1 and goes up to the purpose of your life with horizon 5. In his <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2015/05/podcast-01-david-allen-talks-about-the-new-edition-of-getting-things-done/">podcast</a>, David Allen mentions that for many it takes years to reach these longer-term perspectives. It takes a long time to integrate them into the system. He suggests one should start off with the day-to-day and form long-term plans bottom-up.</p><p>GTD horizons with their increased abstraction remind me of Eastern religions such as buddhism. In stoicism as well one works towards a very distant ideal of "enlightenment". This is not far-fetched as David Allen is a black belt karateka and used his experience in the conception of GTD. The book mentions having a "mind like water" to be ready for anything that may come to you as a concept from martial arts. There's also a blog by David Allen with <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2019/05/10-reasons-gtd-is-like-karate/">10 more similarities</a>.</p><h2 id="is-it-simply-self-exploitation%3F">Is it Simply Self-Exploitation?</h2><p>"Increasing productivity" also has a stale 19th century factory worker exploitation aspect to me. At least the basis of management "science" had very questionable origins. Managers "scientifically" noted how long some workers took to complete a task. They noted the fastest and decided to increase work quotas for everybody. Even then short-term exploitation didn't have long-term lasting positive effects.</p><p>One could argue that a personal productivity system only serves as self-exploitation. Where managers exploited industrial workers, we do it ourselves now. I haven't read or though much about this, but a <a href="https://dev.to/tinmanjk/the-curious-case-of-self-exploitation--303j">dev article by Ivan Petrov raises some interesting points</a>. They emphasize:</p><blockquote><p>What I have learned and forgotten and re-learned is that the power NOT to do (negative potency) seems to be the only weapon.</p></blockquote><p>This at least we can take to heart by filtering out many actions. We can also try to move away from "outside" areas of (work) focus and focus on our own values and vision.</p><h2 id="trial-period">Trial Period</h2><p>For the next month until December 6th, I'm implementing GTD and revisiting its techniques.

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bezos. I’m all in favor of a clean fulfillment center, but tell me: Why do you sweep? Why do you not instead eliminate the source of dirt? - Unknown “insultant”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does DevOps pass the “so what?” test? When you start to follow the history of DevOps from Agile, Lean, TOS, TQM, TPS, and beyond; doesn’t it lead to plain old critical thinking? Is it anything special? If it’s so simple, if anyone can do it, then why on earth would the worlds richest person <a href="https://youtu.be/O4MtQGRIIuA?t=1250">pay an “insultant” to teach him</a>? Jeff seems to understand that eliminating waste is important, that you should never pass a defect down the line, but he seems to discard the sweeping question as too abstract, and not useful.</p>
<p>Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS) may be a perfect example of an organization that’s proud of their ability to <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/education/lcps/2020/11/14/las-cruces-public-schools-what-ransomware-attack-taught-us/6296955002/">scale up sweeping operations in response to a ransomware incident</a>. Why are they so proud of their investment of resources, to deal with ransomware? <a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">How does that support their mission</a>? Who’s their customer? Ransomware? If DevOps is just critical thinking and LCPS’ value statement is “<a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">our expectation is that our schools are diverse, equitable, and provide opportunities for the development of critical thinking and democratic ideals</a>”, then shouldn’t we hold them accountable for critical thinking?</p>
<p>Nobody gravitates towards DevOps when everything is working. DevOps isn’t valuable in environments where waste is cheap, it’s valuable where waste isn’t cheap. I’d have to think it’s valuable in any public school system that’s struggling to meet demand within their budget. Maybe it’s too late to help LCPS avoid ransomware, but maybe we can help another school system through a little critical thinking exercise.</p>
<p>Most of what people assume is “DevOps” is just repackaged teaching from an Isreali physicist who wrote a book for the business world in 1984. That book, The Goal, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2012/06/the-goal-eli-goldratts-gripping-thriller-about-operations-theory.html">is still popular in business schools</a>. If there’s one thing Eliyahu Goldratt, the author of The Goal, consistently talks about in all of his teaching, it’s understanding cause and effect. Goldratt advocates for the use of what he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)">Current Reality Tree</a> (CRT) to map out the cause and effect of a problem, the conflict, and where to focus resources on resolution.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with Ransomware, it may look something like this if we simply map out the cause and effect relationships of what we know about a <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-1.png" alt="simple cause and effect"></p>
<p>Make sense? Now let’s look at a full current reality tree, where we go beyond the ransomware incident, and start to look at how a ransomware opportunity was created.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="full crt">
<a href="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png">Full Image</a></p>
<p>It balloons out when we start to understand all the vectors of how they get on our network, and what they do, once they get there.</p>
<p>Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">Phishing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/">Perimeter System: Compromised Credentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-kingdom-ransomware-hacks-networks-with-pulse-vpn-flaws/">Perimeter System: Missing Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they get on the network they’ll deploy a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/24/cobalt_strike_cisco_talos/">command and control</a> (C&amp;C) tool that enables them to drop additional tools and start hunting domain admins. They’ll search for servers or computers <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">where they can login, and where the domain admin is logged in</a>. Once they find that system they grab either the domain admin’s password, or their session information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">just as good as a password</a>), then it’s game over. They now have keys to the kingdom and can delete backups and encrypt systems.</p>
<p>Now that you know how it works, and the cause and effect: Did LCPS eliminate the source of dirt?</p>
<p>This is the only statement that covers what they learned, and how they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, we have installed firewalls, updated our systems, invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure so we can protect ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to our current reality tree we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a firewall address the conflict points? It’s not clear if they’re talking about a new fancy next-gen perimeter firewall, improved network segregation, or host firewalls. Segregation and host firewalls could help if they prevent the bad actor from logging into a shared system where domain admin is logged in.</li>
<li>Was the problem updated systems? Possible vector if they’re not patching, but it doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
<li>Invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure. Great. Keep it up, but it still doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the core conflict:</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-3.png" alt="core conflict"></p>
<p>The number of domain admins is the core conflict. It’s rarely necessary to have any domain admins, but most organizations have much more than zero when it’s easier to give somebody domain admin access, than it is to take the time to give them only the access they need to do their job. Plain old Least Privilege. Plain old <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/controlled-use-of-administrative-privileges/">#4 on the CIS Top 20 security controls</a>.</p>
<p>Did LCPS go back and fix the core conflict, or are they still passing a defect downline? What should they have done prior to the Ransomware breach? What can you do now? Evaluate your blast radius. Your InfoSec and/or IT teams should be following the advice of <a href="https://adsecurity.org/">adsecurity.org</a>. They should be running tools like <a href="https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound">Plumhound</a> or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/">Infection Monkey</a> to understand and reduce blast radius.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an IT or InfoSec expert to get a glimpse into your ransomware risk. You’re at less risk, possibly near zero, if your organization isn’t using Active Directory; but if they are, you can run the powershell below from your computer to evaluate blast radius.</p>
<pre><code># This will install AD tools on Windows 10
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
# This will list all domain admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
# This will list all enterprise admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
</code></pre>
<p>That powershell will list user accounts ransomware teams are interested in, the ones they’ll go after once they land on your network. Ideally that list is zero. It’s not zero? Shocker! How about passwords? Are they being rotated quickly? Ideally every 7 days or less. What’s the logon count look like? Is it in the hundreds? Ouch, somebody is running around with scissors.</p>
<p>Concerned? Send that output to your IT or InfoSec teams. Ask them if they understand the advice of adsecurity.org or Plumhound. Maybe they have it under control, but maybe they need a little poking to remind them it’s important.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about the so what of DevOps, and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book. Send me an <a href="https://ericalexander.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0a4a5b6afb0b3eea2afafab80a5b2a9a3a1aca5b8a1aea4a5b2eeafb2a7ffb3b5a2aaa5a3b4fda2afafabe6a1adb0fba2afa4b9fd8ca5b4e5f2f0ada5e5f2f0abaeafb7e5f2f0b7a8a5aee5f2f0a9b4e7b3e5f2f0afb5b4">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericalexanderorg">LinkedIn</a> if you’re interested in the book.</p>

The most important update is obviously the announcement from Pfizer that they had developed a vaccine offering ‘90% protection’ against COVID-19. The stock market reacted accordingly, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening up 1,500 points on Monday morning, and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index rocketing 7% higher for the&nbsp;<em>day.&nbsp;</em>Now, the ironic part of all this is that the positive vaccine news is coming at a time when we are seeing exponential growth in cases around the country. On Friday the United States hit another daily record for COVID cases at 184,514 reported cases.</p>
<p>However, knowing that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel I want to use today’s post to focus on some of the silver linings and unintended&nbsp;<em>positive</em> consequences of past crises, crashes, and darkest hours in history. While there is much to be negative about in a time of pandemics and politics, there will be certainly be knock-on effects that have a positive effect on society, markets, and business.</p>
<p>For instance, a recent example that was pointed out to me was the return on investment for London’s considerable investment in the city’s infamous 19th century sewage system, as described below:</p>
<p>London was a rapidly growing city with a population that had reached two million by 1840, having doubled since the beginning of the century and it had a big sewage problem. Before the construction of proper sewers, most of London’s sewage was recycled as fertilizer. Individual houses had cesspools (though often these were just the cellars). The solid waste or ‘night-soil’ was collected from these by well-paid ‘nightmen’ (they were only allowed to work at night) who transported it to the market gardens surrounding the city. The wastewater either seeped into the ground or flowed through the streets into the old natural rivers, which had become public sewers. These all eventually flowed out into the River Thames.</p>
<h4>London’s Water Supply Problem</h4>
<p>Supplying clean drinking water was another serious problem. Some of London’s water came from shallow wells within the city and was delivered by the bucketful. More prosperous areas had piped water provided by private water companies from springs in the hills around London or, most dangerously, from the Thames itself.</p>
<p>The invention of the flush toilet or water closet at the end of the eighteenth century made things worse. Well-off households that could afford a proper water supply could now dispense with a smelly cesspool and simply flush all their waste away – and out into the Thames.</p>
<h4><strong>Cholera Arrives</strong></h4>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/the_silent_highwayman_800.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460"></p><p>Death rows on the polluted River Thames in a cartoon from Punch Magazine (1858)</p></div>
<p><strong>Cholera is a deadly disease. The primary symptom is acute diarrhea, which drains the body of nutrients and fluids. In 1831, there was a global outbreak. It had originated in India but had spread across Europe and arrived in Britain. This outbreak killed over 6,000 people in London. At the time, the cause of the disease was a mystery. The link between the disease and the contamination of drinking water by human sewage was suspected by some. It was obvious that Thames water, when seen through a microscope, was far from clean and it was a subject of wonderful campaigning cartoons in the London newspapers and the satirical magazine Punch.</strong></p>
<p>However, at this time the dominant opinion was the ‘miasmatic theory’, that the disease was spread by ‘fould air’. It wasn’t the polluted water that was deadly, but the very smell of it…</p>
<p>In 1848 the government had established a Metropolitan Commission of Sewers. After issuing a general invitation to engineers to submit proposals for dealing with London’s sewage, an engineer with a background in land drainage methods, Joseph Bazalgette, was hired. In 1855, the Metropolitan Local Management Bill was put through Parliament. This attempted to centralise some aspects of the administration of London. It created the <strong>Metropolitan Board of Works</strong>, one of whose duties was to ‘make such sewers and works as they may think necessary for preventing all and any part of the sewage of the Metropolis from flowing into the River Thames in or near the Metropolis’.</p>
<p>Joseph Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer for the Board of Works. He took his duties very seriously, reviewing 137 different proposals and producing a detailed plan for a scheme of intercepting sewers collecting London’s sewage and discharging it into the Thames 10 miles further downstream (which could be interpreted as being ‘near the Metropolis’)…</p>
<p>Bazalgette’s scheme was an extraordinary feat of engineering. It involved the construction of major new ‘intercepting sewers’ that would collect sewage from the existing piecemeal array of sewers and move it down river. On the north bank, sewage would be carried eastwards as far as Beckton, eight miles east of St Paul’s Cathedral, to be stored and then discharged on the outgoing tide. On the south bank, the sewage would flow as far as Crossness, two miles further downstream, where the same would happen.</p>
<div>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/bazalgettes_system_of_intercepting_sewers_-_800_1.jpg" alt="Bazalgette’s system of intercepting sewers " width="767" height="441"></p><p>A map of Bazalgette’s 1858 scheme</p></div>
</div>
<p>Most of the scheme was very carefully designed to flow by gravity, but at critical points, all of the sewage would have to be pumped to a higher level using huge steam pumps. Those installed at Deptford in 1864 were at the time the largest ever built. One of these pumping stations was at Abbey Mills, where much of the sewage from London’s East End had to be pumped up into the enormous Northern Outfall Sewer which flowed across the marshland towards the discharge point at Beckton. This was a prestige project and the buildings above ground, such as the pumping stations, were lavishly decorated.</p>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/crossness_pumping_station_-_800_2.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="378"></p><p>The restored interior of the pumping station at Crossness</p></div>
<p>Bazalgette replaced 165 miles of old sewers as well as constructing 1100 miles of new ones. It required the excavation of 3.5 million cubic yards of earth by hand – there were no mechanical diggers at the time. The construction consumed 318 million bricks and demand was such that it forced up the price of them in London by about 50%. The need for more bricklayers meant that wages had to be increased from 5 shillings (25 pence) per day to 6 shillings (30 pence) or more. It consumed nearly a million cubic yards of concrete. A special mill was built at Crossness to produce this, together with a railway to distribute it</p>
<p>The project made pioneering use of Portland cement, which was water resistant, rather than conventional lime mortar. Because its manufacturing process was so new, Bazalgette insisted on a draconian regime of quality control, with every batch being tested before it was used. The southern drainage scheme was completed in 1865 and the northern one in 1868. Most of the pumping stations were opened by Royalty, and some of the enormous sewage pumps were even named after members of the royal family.</p>

<p>While the project was an incredibly costly one, we can only imagine the impact that this improved sewage system had on the city in terms of preventing widespread and frequent cholera outbreaks going forward. Like the theme of today’s post, this positive outcome stemmed from a dark period in London that was filled with disease and death. This impressive engineering feat offered a real silver lining.</p>

<p>If you want top-notch journalism, you only have to look to <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonzweigwsj">Jason Zweig</a>&nbsp;at the Wall Street Journal. Some of you may remember the story of A.P. Giannini that I included&nbsp;<a href="https://investoramnesia.com/2020/03/29/pandemics-crashes/">a few months back</a> , but it was Jason who told me about this story, and he’s written a piece on Giannini that is just incredible. Even better, it’s part of a new series that Jason’s writing for the WSJ:&nbsp;<em>Back in Business is a new, occasional column that will put the present day in perspective by looking at business history and those who shaped it.</em></p>
<p>I’ll just give you a little teaser as you should really read the article, but did you know Bank of America was actually founded as the Bank of Italy? Read how the founder took it upon himself to help the people of San Francisco with an early example of microfinancing after the San Francisco earthquake ravaged the city in 1906.</p>

<p>For those that survived, the Black Death was a godsend for serfs in Europe as the decimated labor supply suddenly gave them some leverage at the bargaining table with Lords of vast manors that suddenly had little to no laborers to till their land. Despite the atrocity that was the bubonic plague, the dissolution of serfdom across large swathes of Europe offers a silver lining.</p>
<p><em>‘After the Black Death, serfdom disappeared in Western Europe while making a resurgence in Eastern Europe. What explains this difference? I argue that serfdom was against the interests of the sovereign and was only imposed when the nobility, most of whom needed serfdom to maintain their economic and social standing, had leverage to impose their will. One way the nobility gained this power was through financing the military. Using data from the fourteenth to through the eighteenth centuries, I show that serfdom was imposed in areas where sovereigns had few other resources to pay for war or defense. This paper addresses the causes of a historical institution that scholars from Moore (1966) to Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) have argued played an important role in the development, or lack thereof, of democracy and long-term economic growth.’</em></p>

<p>July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Twitter can be a very useful source of information and news. Or, it can waste your time and make you sad. It’s all in how you use it. Here I’ll show you how to make Twitter work for you, instead of against you.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to turn Twitter into a useful tool, but there is one central concept that is more important than everything else combined. If you absorb and apply this idea, you will transform Twitter from a source of pointless irritation into a veritable lifehack.</p>
<p>The secret is to completely separate the concepts of <em>following</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>Let me explain: the person finally giving in and signing up for Twitter looks for instruction and advice on how to get started and how to use it. This advice, either from helpful writers on the internet or from Twitter itself, goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Look for people who are interesting to you;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow them;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observe your timeline, where their tweets will appear.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this advice, you will be doing it wrong. This is the exact opposite of how you should use Twitter. The problems with this approach are:</p>
<p>You may see the tweets not always in the order in which they were tweeted, but in some other order that Twitter creates for you;</p>
<p>You will see “promoted tweets” interpolated between the tweets you signed up to see. This is paid advertising;</p>
<p>You will see random other things you didn’t ask for;</p>
<p>You will be inundated with “suggestions” from Twitter about people to follow, trending topics to keep on top of, and other irrelevant nonsense;</p>
<p>You will never see some of the tweets tweeted by the people you are following. They simply will not appear in your timeline;</p>
<p>Everyone can see the list of people you follow. You may or may not want this;</p>
<p>You will discover that the people you followed because you admire them have nothing interesting to say, only tweeting cat pictures and worn-out memes.</p>
<p>In short, you will be fed tons of stuff you never signed up for, and not get what you wanted.</p>
<p>You can’t turn <em>any</em> of this off. Twitter lets you tell it that you want to see <em>less</em> of some kinds of things, but there are no actual settings to turn off advertising or suggestions about fascinating hashtags.</p>
<p>The first step in fixing Twitter for yourself is to understand what following is really for. You don’t follow an account because you want to read their tweets. Twitter is “social media”, and following is a social signal. When you follow someone you are declaring that you approve of that person. Whether or not this is what you intended, this is how your decision to follow someone will be interpreted. If you are, for example, a journalist researching neo-Nazis, and part of your research involves tracking what they are saying on Twitter, you may not want to be seen as endorsing these people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you may want to read certain people’s tweets without following them. And you can! Twitter allows you to create private <em>lists</em> of accounts that you can track without following. You can see all their tweets scroll by without appearing to have endorsed them. The composition of your private lists, and even their existence, will remain secret. The people you add won’t know you’re adding them, nor that you’re seeing their tweets, unless you choose to interact with them. In addition, the tweets will appear in chronological order, with no interpolated advertising nor any other junk, unlike in your timeline. But you must not forget to mark the lists as private. In the picture below, one arrow points to the widget for creating a new list, and another points to the all-important checkbox for making the list private. You should only make private lists; there is no reason to make public lists, and, in fact, some people object to being placed in them (for some reason that escapes me, but behavior on Twitter is weird in many ways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/newlist.png" alt="Making a list"></p>
<p>Make as many lists as you want, as fine-grained or as general as you think will be useful to you. You can have an astronomy list, or a list just with people who talk about astrophotography with iPhones. You can make a list for local news, and one for international news. You can put accounts in more than one list, so the exact composition of a list is not a crucial decision. This is how you separate the concepts of reading and following. You follow when you want to let people know you are following (hi, Mom), and you want everyone else to know, too. When you become famous and have a million followers, you can follow others to amplify their signals. Until then, follow to encourage, to lend support, and to let others know where you stand. If you also want to read the tweets of someone you follow (and you might not), put that person in one of your lists in addition. Your followee’s tweets will also appear in your timeline, but you won’t see them there, because <em>you will never look at your timeline</em>. Of course, you literally don’t have to follow a single person. Following is public. Aggregating accounts into lists is your private business.</p>
<p>Lists become most useful when there is an interface for conveniently seeing what’s on them. The regular Twitter clients are not very good for this, but Twitter has an alternative client that is made for it. Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a>. It divides your twitterverse into columns. Each column can contain the tweets from one of your lists; in addition, you can create columns that track search terms, individual accounts, hashtags, your notifications, your direct messages, and more. By default, it will have a column with your timeline, but you can delete that, because, as I hope is clear by now, your timeline is a waste of time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/tweetdeck.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck. Picture by Ruben Schade">
</figure>
<p>This interface, although not perfect, helps a great deal in making Twitter more useful. If you keep it open, it can be a low-distraction way of monitoring recent tweets from low-traffic lists. You can delete columns you don’t care about today, and add them back in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lists and search terms, combined with the avoidance of the timeline and the use of TweetDeck, already turns Twitter from a cesspool with advertising into a useful news feed. But by combining this with a few other practices, you can make Twitter even better.</p>
<p>First, control yourself. Use the platform as a source of timely information, and as a way to be helpful with others by offering information or advice. Do not, ever, no matter how strongly you feel that someone is <em><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a></em>, get into an argument on Twitter. I have often failed to heed this advice myself; do what I say, not what I do. Twitter can be a fantastic source of news from all over the world; it is often the first place you will hear about something, and sometimes the only place. It can be a very useful platform for receiving and offering technical information, such as links to papers. I recently contributed a scrap of code, in a tweet, for a maintainer of the venerable linux utility <code>curl</code>; the result is in <a href="https://github.com/curl/stats/commit/ac6ae20082fd5e61aa7122b1d4c6030e48ba52a9">this commit</a>. This kind of interaction is satisfying, but trying to have an actual discussion or argument never is, because it is impossible to do with this platform. At best, you will score points against someone not as clever as you; and that and $2.50 will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Next, use the muting function. Even members of your carefully curated lists will sometimes decide to spend a week talking incessantly about their new sneakers. Mute them until they get over it. <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/makeTwitterBetter/">Mute words and phrases</a>, too, for those times when a bunch of people are talking about something that you don’t care to see in your feeds (NBA playoffs, political debates, you name it).</p>
<p>When you discover someone interesting on Twitter, check their profile for a link to a website. <img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/redfern.png"> Click on it. If the person is worth following on Twitter, his or her website is likely to be of even more interest. Check the site for an Atom or RSS feed (look over to the right to see where I’ve used a version of the Atom/RSS feed icon). If there is one, subscribe in your feedreader. If you don’t have a feedreader, you should set one up. I use <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a>.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve shown you some ways to make Twitter work for you. If you have any additional suggestions, please leave me a comment so I can incorporate them.</p>

                The Guinness Book of World Records says that Deinococcus radiodurans is the worldâ€™s most extremophile bacterium. As its name suggests, this bacterium can deal with radiation. It has even been found on the inside walls of nuclear reactors.
            </p>

            <div><h3>Fascination with these survivors</h3>

<p>Scientists have been fascinated by these tough bacteria for years. The <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/microbes/">microbes</a> can deal with extreme cold, lack of water, vacuums and high acidity. And how is it that it can also withstand extreme radiation despite the fact that radiation does not occur in the natural world?</p>

<h3>Back-up against mutations</h3>

<p>Since they started researching its genome, scientists have discovered various mechanisms in the bacterium which protect it against mutation. <em>D. radiodurans</em> has within it, for example, multiple copies of its genome. If just one of these remains unchanged, it can survive. <em>D. radiodurans</em> also has an extremely efficient <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/dna/">DNA</a> repair mechanism.</p>

<h3>Learning from bacteria</h3>

<p>Genetic mutations have major consequences for mankind. Human cells only have one copy of the genome and do not have <em>D. radioduransâ€™</em> quick and efficient DNA repair mechanism. It is possible that we could learn a lot from this bacterium. For example, research into the micro-organism could lead to medical applications to protect people better against the terrible results of radiation poisoning.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a while since we released v0.2 of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and that I have posted about it <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">here</a>.</p>
<p>In that post I gave a view about the potential future of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. We finally released v0.3 and the future is now the default.</p>
<p>Just listing all the changes we made would probably be quite boring and therefore I want to create a neat animation along the way and explain some parts of the awesome Fourier series.</p>
<p>I think quite a lot of people have heard about the Fourier series but didn't fully understand it. I'm quite sure I'm still part of that crew. Others might not know what I'm talking about and I don't know whether it's a good idea to read this post as your introduction but I'll give my best.</p>
<p>Additionally, I envy the latter group because Fourier series is something extremely fascinating.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly for readers who are interested in <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and JuliaLang so I'll start with the changes we did for v0.3.</p>

<h2 id="changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level"><a href="#changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level">Changes in v0.3 on a higher level</a></h2>
<p>We finally have a version for transposing a matrix or I prefer to say general morphing capabilities as transposing only works sometimes 😄 Nevertheless, I'll make a post about that shortly after this one. (Okay let's say in November... hopefully)</p>
<p>Something that unfortunately didn't make it into v0.3 though is the ability to have layers but we are getting there. We conceptually have a plan for it but haven't found the time to code it yet. There might be also some tweaks to the concept.</p>
<p>The next point from the list of <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">the previous post</a> is "Renaming stuff".</p>
<p>We did rename quite a few things and I hope a bit that you either haven't used v0.2 of Javis 😂 OR that you are adaptable and are happy with the changes we made.</p>
<p>Let's just list a few of them:</p>
<p><code>Action</code> and <code>SubAction</code> are now called <code>Object</code> and <code>Action</code> respectively. This is due to the fact that the <code>Action</code> before describes more the object itself and doesn't have the capability to actually move the object now. It had the option before but we decided to remove it. We did this to simplify the codebase and make the distinction much clearer.</p>
<p>Next up we simplified <code>BackgroundAction</code> to <code>Background</code>. No more comments on that 😄</p>
<p>Finally we removed <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code> and <code>Scaling</code> and introduced <code>anim_translate</code>, <code>anim_rotate</code>/<code>anim_rotate_around</code> as well as <code>anim_scale</code> because working with functions instead of structs seems to be more natural and the naming specifies that we do some animation here and not a static translation.</p>
<p>Our last mayor change was to get rid of the <code>javis</code> function and the weird design I started with. It was a huge mess with these weird arrays.</p>
<p>One now defines the video, objects and actions just line by line and renders the video in the end.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object((args...)-&gt;circle(O, 100, :fill), Point(-500, 0))
rolling = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
act!(ball, rolling)

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif" alt="Rolling ball 1"></a></p><p>I think one can clearly see what is defined where besides maybe a few quirks... 😄</p>
<p>The <code>circle</code> function takes the center point and the radius as well as the action (here <code>:fill</code>). Why do I define it at the center center? I could have defined it at <code>Point(-500, 0)</code> but I like to think of objects being centered and then move them around. Maybe it's just me but it has the advantage that it's easy to scale objects correctly and makes rotations easier.</p>
<p>It's not really possible to see a rotation of a circle (currently we don't rotate it). How about adding something to the circle such that we can differentiate between a rotating circle and a moving one.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

function my_circle(args...)
    circle(O, 100, :fill)
    sethue("black")
    line(O, Point(100, 0), :stroke)
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object(my_circle, Point(-500, 0))
translating = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
rotating = Action(anim_rotate(0.0, 2*2π))
act!(ball, [translating, rotating])

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball_2.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif" alt="Rolling ball 2"></a></p><p>That one is clearly rolling. Okay I might have gotten a bit distracted with that one 😄 but we can reuse that for later.</p>
<p>Now in v0.2 it would be quite hard to make the line inside the circle grow longer with time I think. Actually this was possible with v0.2.2 but I haven't written about it yet so this is the time of <strong>change</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")

<p>We basically try to combine simple waves (sine waves) and add them up to create a square wave.</p>
<p>Importantly there is nothing special about the square function. This works with every function. One just needs to add quite a lot of the functions together. For the actual result we need infinitely many. </p>
<h3 id="lets_quickly_change_to_2d"><a href="#lets_quickly_change_to_2d">Let's quickly change to 2D</a></h3>
<p>I actually want to draw something in 2D though instead of this 1D function. 2D is much more interesting when you ask me.</p>
<p>BTW this entire idea of using <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> to visualize the Fourier series came from <a href="https://github.com/ric-cioffi">Riccardo Cioffi</a>, who I like to call the first user of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. He also coded it himself without us knowing about this until we saw <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/fourier-draws-the-julia-logo/47309">his post</a> about it on the JuliaLang discourse. Please check it out!</p>
<p>It was done using a previous version of Javis so the code doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I'll wait here for a couple of minutes while you enjoy his stunning visualization.</p>
<p>Let's start with some building blocks that make sense to understand the Fourier series in 2D. I'll start with circles and complex numbers.</p>
<p>In general I'll basically go through the stuff that Grant Sanderson explained beautifully on his YouTube Channel 3blue1brown <a href="https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k">But what is a Fourier series?</a>. There are some more references at the end of this post 😉</p>
<p>You've seen some circles before but let's have a look at how to work with them using complex numbers.</p>
<p>I here refer to the usage of the formula</p><p>
\[
e^{2\pi i t}
\]
</p><p>where t is our variable ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>i</code> is the imaginary unit.</p>
<p>This therefore computes a complex number when we give it some \(t\). We plot that by simply using the real component of our complex number on the x-axis and the complex component on the y-axis.</p>
<p>In this visualization the circle is drawn up to a certain point at each frame and completes the circle with <code>t=1.00</code></p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif" alt="Circle path"></a></p><p>This is just something to keep in mind for the rest of the post. </p>
<p>Next up we start with a shape let's say a star that we want to draw using circles rotating around circles as circles are the sine waves of 2D space.</p>
<p>I think this is best explained visually so I'll show you what we are trying to achieve first and then show you how to get there. </p>
<h3 id="what_we_want_to_create"><a href="#what_we_want_to_create">What we want to create</a></h3>
<p>This is kind of what we want to achieve but we will have a look at more complicated shapes later. For that we will use more circles though and then it's hard to grasp what's going on.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring makes me happy</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>This is why I have come to appreciate ideas such as <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a>. This is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit me better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Proven tech vs new tools</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine is <a href="https://panelbear.com/">Panelbear</a>, it started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware Kubernetes is an absolute overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. That’s why I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone. Do what you know best.
As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><p>Another case in which it paid off once again, was when I wanted to experiment with using Clickhouse for data ingestion and the aggregation queries. It took me less than 10 minutes to write a basic deployment manifest and have it up and running. This included automated SSL certs, in-cluster service discovery, and unified logging/monitoring out of the box. It was a huge win since it allowed me to try things out faster than before.</p><p>Even better, I can deploy any container and operate it the exact same way as I deploy anything else on my cluster. Need more volume storage with zero downtime? It’s a simple manifest change, commit and deploy. Same thing when I needed Redis for caching, I was up and running in minutes, without increasing my costs or adding operational complexity.</p><h2>Focus on shipping</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this blog post. I plan on writing more about Panelbear’s tech stack, and lessons learned along the way. So stay tuned!</p></div></div></div>]]>

                <p>The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?</p>

<p>The Risk-First perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different <em>software development risks</em>.  Risk isn’t something that just appears in a report, it actually drives everything we do.</p>

<p>Risk-First is split into three main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/thinking/Start">Part 1: Thinking Risk-First</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/risks/Start">Part 2: The Risk Landscape</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/practices/Start">Part 3: Practices</a>  <em>(Under Construction)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you want a brief overview of what this is all about, the articles in this section give you a short taster.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate over copyright in the digital age is clouded by so many layers of new-age malarkey and overblown, political banner-waving that it’s easy to lose sight of the behavioral realities behind all the self-serving theories of bloggers, legal scholars, corporate interests, and futurists. Take a very common activity like watching movies online via torrents or other sites that enable free viewing (aka piracy).&nbsp; My kids’ generation, growing up around this behavior as a norm, will hear words to describe this kind of movie viewing as contrarily <i>theft</i> or <i>sharing</i>.&nbsp; What are they to make of it?&nbsp; Certainly, I’ve taught them to share and not to steal.&nbsp; For the sake of their cultural and psychological growth, however, I’d suggest for the purposes of discussion, that this kind of media overconsumption is, if nothing else, dumb.</p>
<p>For context, we need to admit that the majority of unlicensed, online movie viewing is done by young, middle-class, generally privileged Americans, who are watching mainstream, Hollywood-produced fare. Search for top movies viewed through torrent sites, for example, and you’ll find that the lists will comprise tentpole films produced by the big studios who represent the part of the industry most vilified for efforts to mitigate piracy. If that hypocrisy is not enough to raise your brows, though, the very nature of these films is then used as a justification for the pirate-enabled viewing in itself. We typically hear some combination of the following:&nbsp; “So much of the mainstream stuff is junk that it doesn’t deserve to be paid for.&nbsp; These films already make millions. I would never pay to see it anyway, so it’s not like they’re losing a sale.”&nbsp; If my own kids presented me with these rationales, we’d have a serious talk because this is corrupt thinking no matter what the law, the technologists, or the economic theories say.</p>
<p>Consolidate these oft-repeated positions into the declarative, first person, and the stupid shines through a little clearer:&nbsp; “I’m going to spend hours of my life watching movies I probably won’t like, but because I expect not to like them, I’m not going to pay for them.”&nbsp; And as a kicker, “I am going to help put money in the pockets of the people who stole the movies in the first place.”&nbsp; Bloggers like Mike Masnick will try to argue the new and bizarre economics of free media; and scholars like Mr. Lessig will argue that there is something intellectually or culturally constraining about “permission culture.” Then, these purely academic theories trickle down to the ears of my kids and their contemporaries, who translate it all into the aforementioned rationale. But as a parent living in the real world, what I’ve just heard my kids say is that they’re shoplifting cartons of potato chips at the corner store, which doesn’t matter because chips aren’t real food anyway.&nbsp; Hence, my kids now have both a moral <i>and</i> a health problem.</p>
<p>With regard to movies (or any creative media) the first thing I’d tell my own children is that their lives are not at all enriched by watching scores of films they probably won’t like. To the contrary, when they make time for media consumption, they should develop a critical sense for what kind films might be worth the investment of their time and attention. What matters is not the fifty films they’ll forget within hours of viewing, but the five this year that will change their lives in some way. It doesn’t matter that the sale for the producers of the tentpole is zero whether my kid watches it through a torrent or doesn’t see it at all; what matters is making the decision that if it isn’t worth paying for, it probably isn’t worth the equally valuable resources of time and attention. In short, it’s not only okay to let some things go, you don’t really have a choice.</p>
<p>It is a valuable component of cultural experience for the individual to pay attention to what kind of art or media affects him and to seek out that which fulfills these emotional connections.&nbsp; Nobody can watch, read, listen to, or experience everything; so there is not only nothing wrong with scarcity, it is an absolute necessity for an individual’s cultural development. Those who promote the idea of abundance as some sort of digital-age renaissance are not really contributing to a more enlightened, more cultured generation so much as they’re breeding a new crop of agitated media junkies. Remove for a moment the questions of legality or creators’ rights, and we’re still living in an era of media obesity and don’t yet know what this means for the future of culture in general.</p>
<p>Many of the filmmakers whose works have touched my life and the lives of my contemporaries were dead before the Internet was even built.&nbsp; We somehow managed to experience their films without this technology and without in any way contributing to IP theft. Through pre-Internet experiences, I have seen motion pictures that I doubt my own children will ever know existed; and still, in over thirty years of loving this medium, I know that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of films that I will not see in my lifetime. This is true for my children as well, despite the overblown promise of technology to put “the world at their fingertips.” So, what I’ll tell my kids is simply this:&nbsp; “You can’t consume it all, you shouldn’t try, and whatever is worth your time is also worth your money.”</p>

This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It provides
  unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user
  automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as Startup
  Disk in macOS Recovery. It is possible to make your system security much
  weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This tool is not to
  be used in production environments. It is possible to render your system
  unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand how the
  security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!
<p><code>bputil</code> performs actions by calling the
    BootPolicy library. This modifies the security configuration of the system,
    which is stored in a file called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally
    signed by the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used
    to sign the LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only
    accessible when a user has put in their password as part of a successful
    authentication. This is why this tool must either have a username and
    password specified on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.</p>
<p>By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making
    changes to the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main
    Application Processor (AP). It will only allow the below
    security-downgrading operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended
    boot state. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) was first introduced to
    Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to macOS Recovery would provide
    intentional friction which would make it harder for malicious software to
    downgrade the system. That precedent is extended here to detect the special
    boot to macOS Recovery via holding the power key at boot time. We refer to
    this as One True Recovery (1TR), and most of the below downgrade options
    will only work when booted into 1TR, not when called from normal macOS. This
    helps ensure that only a physically-present user, not malicious software
    running in macOS, can permanently downgrade the security settings. The below
    CLI options specify what boot environments a downgrade can be performed
    from.</p>
<p>The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.
    Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as
    whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with metadata
    specific to the particular machine (a "personalized" signature,
    which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or whether it
    will accept "global" signatures which are valid for all units of a
    specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence other boot or OS
    security behavior as described in the below options.</p>
<dl>

    <code>--username</code> <var>username</var></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used to specify the username for a user with access to the
        signing key to authenticate the change.</p>
    <p>If this is specified the below password option is required
        too.</p>
    <p>If this is not specified, an interactive prompt will request
        the username.</p>

        "Apple Platform Security" website documentation. If the system

  <dd>
    <p>Changes security mode to Full Security. This option is
        mutually exclusive with all options below which cause security
        downgrades. Full Security is effectively a LocalPolicy which is in its
        default state, lacking all available security downgrades. Full Security
        also performs an online check at software install and upgrade time to
        ensure that only the latest version of software can be installed. This
        prevents accidentally installing old software which has known
        vulnerabilities in it. If the security is downgraded away from Full
        Security, and then re-upgraded to Full Security, the online check will
        be performed, and if the software is no longer the latest available, it
        will not be possible to set it to Full Security again. Because online
        checks are only performed at software installation, upgrade, and Full
        Security policy setting time, it is possible for an OS to report that it
        is Full Security despite not being the latest software version. Full
        Security only indicates the state as of the latest install or
      upgrade.</p>

    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to

    <p>This changes the security mode to Reduced Security. Reduced
        Security will use the "global" digital signature for macOS, in
        order to allow running software which is not the latest version. Thus
        anything other than the latest software therefore may have security
        vulnerabilities. At a high level, Reduced Security does not necessarily
        require the latest software, but it does still require all software be
        digitally signed by Apple or 3rd party software developers. Passing this
        option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from scratch, (i.e. it
        does not preserve any existing security policy options) and only the
        options specified via this tool will exist in the output local

    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to

    <p>This changes the security mode to Permissive Security.
        Permissive Security uses the same "global" digital signature
        for macOS as the above Reduced Security option, in order to allow
        running software which is not the latest version. Thus anything other
        than the latest software therefore may have security vulnerabilities. At
        a high level, Permissive Security allows configuration options to be set
        to not require all software to be digitally signed. This can allow users
        who are not part of the Apple Developer program to still be able to
        introduce their own software into their system. Additionally, especially
        dangerous security downgrades may be restricted to Permissive Security,
        and only available via CLI tools for power users rather than GUIs.
        Passing this option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from
        scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any existing security policy
        options) and only the options specified via this tool will exist in the

    <p>The AuxilaryKernelCache is a SEP-signed boot object which can
        be verified and loaded into kernel memory before that memory is
        restricted to being non-writable by a "Configurable Text Read-only
        Region" (CTRR) hardware register. Introducing 3rd party kernel
        extensions can introduce architectural or implementation flaws into the
        kernel, which can lead to system compromise. In order to achieve
        iOS-like security properties, 3rd party kexts must be denied by default,
        and only loadable if the customer consciously opts in to lowering their
        security from 1TR.</p>

    <p>This disables the enforcement of the "Configurable Text

        as non-writable. This is sometimes required for performing actions such
        as using dynamic DTrace code hooks to profile kernel behavior or perform
        3rd party kernel extension debugging. However, the lack of CTRR
        enforcement makes it much easier for an attacker to modify the kernel

<p>The basic installation format for users who install packages via <code>pip</code> is
the wheel format. Wheel names are composed of four parts: a
package-name-and-version tag (which can be further broken down), a Python tag,
an ABI tag, and a platform tag. More information on the tags can be found in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425">PEP 425</a>.  So a package like NumPy
will be available on PyPI as <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code> for 64-bit
windows and <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code> for macOS. Note
that only the plaform tag <code>win_amd64</code> or <code>macosx_10_9_x86_64</code> differs. </p>
<p>But what about Linux? There is no single, vendor controlled, "Linux platform"
e.g., Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD all package software at slightly
different versions. What most Linux distributions do have in common is the
glibc runtime library, and a smattering of various additional system libraries.
So it is possible to define a least common denominator (LCD) of software
expected to be on a Linux platform (exceptions apply, e.g. non-glibc
distributions).</p>
<p>The decision to converge on a LCD common platform gave birth to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux1</a> standard. Going back
to our example, numpy is available as
<code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>The first manylinux standard, manylinux1, was based on CentOS5 which has <a href="https://endoflife.software/operating-systems/linux/centos">been
obsolete</a> since
March 2017. The subsequent manylinux2010 standard is based on CentOS6, which
will hit end-of-life in December 2020. The manylinux2014 standard still has some
breathing room. Based on CentOS7, it will reach end-of-life in July 2024.</p>
<p>So what is next for <code>manylinux</code>, and what <code>manylinux</code> should users and package
maintainers use?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>If <code>manylinux1</code> is obsolete, why are there still manylinux1 wheels?</h3>
<p>Wheels are typically consumed by Pip via <code>pip install</code>. Manylinux wheels are
used for projects that require compilation, otherwise they would ship
pure Python wheels with the "none" platform tag, meaning they are compatible with
any platform. So say you are a library author and want to make it convenient
for users to install your package. If you ship a manylinux2014 wheel, but the
version of Pip your users have is too old to support manylinux2014 wheels, Pip
will happily download the source package and compile it for them. Havoc ensues:
Windows users typically cannot compile, prerequisites will be missing. Pip has
a <code>--only-binary</code> option to prevent it from downloading source code and
compiling, and a <code>--prefer-binary</code> option to prefer older binary packages over
compiling from source, but neither is on by default.</p>
<p>Pip began supporting manylinux2010 wheels with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/NEWS.rst#190-2019-01-22">version
19.0</a>,
released in Jan 2019. The version of Pip that is officially shipped with Python 3.6, via
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip</a> module, is
version 18. Python 3.7 ships pip 20. It is easy enough to upgrade, but to be on
the safe side, and prevent havoc, library authors will ship a manylinux1 wheel
for Python 3.6 support.</p>
<h3>What happens now that Python 3.6 is falling out of favor?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494">Python 3.6 is no longer in active
development</a>. In fact, the scientific
Python community has decided to stop actively supporting Python 3.6 <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table">from
July 2020</a>.
So I would expect to see projects begin to drop the older manylinux1 format,
and drop support for Python 3.6 sooner rather than later, meaning that
<strong><code>manylinux2014</code> may soon become the only option</strong> for new versions.</p>
<h3>What about Conda packages?</h3>
<p>Conda does not use the same kind of wheel format provided by PyPI and Pip. Conda's
build system is internally consistent, and Conda packagers build a binary
package for each supported OS, thus they are not bound to the manylinux
designation. Conda does not have a declared policy around deprecating Python
3.6 yet. Conda does support <code>pip</code> (but try not to mix <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>
usage!), and the Pip provided should be version 20 or later. If needed,
<code>conda upgrade pip</code> should get you a modern version, so here too
<code>manylinux2014</code> will soon become the only option.</p>
<h3>What comes after manylinux2014?</h3>
<p>The glibc used in manylinux2014 is defined as the one used by CentOS7. This OS
was released in June 2014. This manylinux standard, for the first time,
declared support for non-x86 hardware systems like ARM64 (aarch64), Power
(ppc64) and S390X.  However the ARM platform has grown greatly since 2014, and
glibc has moved from version 2.17 to 2.31, fixing many bugs. Since the real
driver for platform compatibility is glibc, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/">PEP
600</a> defined a "perennial manylinux
spec" that is based on the glibc version number. A lot of work has <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/542">already
taken place</a> to support the next
version. Now we need to take the dive: decide what the base OS for the next
manylinux tag will be, roll out a Docker image and tooling around it, and
convince library packaging teams to adopt it. This is needed to allow libraries
like NumPy to confidently use the glibc routines fixed after 2014. For
instance, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15763">this issue</a> is
preventing NumPy from properly supporting <code>np.float128</code> on Power and S390X.</p>
<h3>What about non-x86 machines and Linux?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, starting with manylinux2014 <code>pip</code> and <code>wheel</code> supports
non-x86 architectures like ARM64. Many packages are just now starting to roll
out support for these architectures, as the CI systems that support open source
projects (like TravisCI) have only recently made those platforms available.
It might be easier for users to adopt Conda and the <code>conda-forge</code> channel
since conda-forge has support for non-x86 architectures today.</p>
<h3>OK, so what is the bottom line?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use pip v20 or later to make it easier on libarary packagers: modern pip
  versions will take the latest manylinux package they can support and will be
  forward-compatible with the PEP 600 perennial manylinux standard.</li>
<li>Manylinux1 and Python 3.6 are going away. Update your systems.</li>
<li>For people looking to move PEP 600 forward, the next step is to dive into the
  <a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel">auditwheel</a> repo to define and support
  the next manylinux version. </li>
</ul>

<h3>raidz vs draid<a href="#raidz-vs-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ZFS users are most likely very familiar with raidz already, so a
comparison with draid would help. The illustrations below are
simplified, but sufficient for the purpose of a comparison. For example,
31 drives can be configured as a zpool of 6 raidz1 vdevs and a hot
spare: <img alt="raidz1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_raidz.png"></p>
<p>As shown above, if drive 0 fails and is replaced by the hot spare, only
5 out of the 30 surviving drives will work to resilver: drives 1-4 read,
and drive 30 writes.</p>
<p>The same 30 drives can be configured as 1 draid1 vdev of the same level
of redundancy (i.e. single parity, 1/4 parity ratio) and single spare
capacity: <img alt="draid1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_draid.png"></p>
<p>The drives are shuffled in a way that, after drive 0 fails, all 30
surviving drives will work together to restore the lost data/parity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All 30 drives read, because unlike the raidz1 configuration shown
above, in the draid1 configuration the neighbor drives of the failed
drive 0 (i.e. drives in a same data+parity group) are not fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All 30 drives write, because now there is no dedicated spare drive.
Instead, spare blocks come from all drives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal application IO: draid and raidz are very similar. There’s a
slight advantage in draid, since there’s no dedicated spare drive
which is idle when not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore lost data/parity: for raidz, not all surviving drives will
work to rebuild, and in addition it’s bounded by the write throughput
of a single replacement drive. For draid, the rebuild speed will
scale with the total number of drives because all surviving drives
will work to rebuild.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev must shuffle its child drives in a way that regardless of
which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read and write) will
distribute evenly among all surviving drives, so the rebuild speed will
scale. The exact mechanism used by the dRAID vdev driver is beyond the
scope of this simple introduction here. If interested, please refer to
the recommended readings in the next section.</p>

<div id="recommended-reading">
<h3>Recommended Reading<a href="#recommended-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parity declustering (the fancy term for shuffling drives) has been an
active research topic, and many papers have been published in this area.
The <a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~tschwarz/TechReports/hpca.pdf">Permutation Development Data
Layout</a> is a
good paper to begin. The dRAID vdev driver uses a shuffling algorithm
loosely based on the mechanism described in this paper.</p>

<p>There are two logical hot spare vdevs shown above at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The names begin with a <code><span>s&lt;id&gt;-</span></code> followed by the name of the parent
dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>These hot spares are logical, made from reserved blocks on all the 53
child drives of the dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional hot spares, the distributed spare can only replace
a drive in its parent dRAID vdev.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev behaves just like a raidz vdev of the same parity level.
You can do IO to/from it, scrub it, fail a child drive and it’d operate
in degraded mode.</p>

<p>When there’s a failed/offline child drive, the dRAID vdev supports a
completely new mechanism to reconstruct lost data/parity, in addition to
the resilver. First of all, resilver is still supported - if a failed
drive is replaced by another physical drive, the resilver process is
used to reconstruct lost data/parity to the new replacement drive, which
is the same as a resilver in a raidz vdev.</p>
<p>But if a child drive is replaced with a distributed spare, a new process
called rebuild is used instead of resilver:</p>

<p>The scan status line of the <em>zpool status</em> output now says <em>“rebuilt”</em>
instead of <em>“resilvered”</em>, because the lost data/parity was rebuilt to
the distributed spare by a brand new process called <em>“rebuild”</em>. The
main differences from <em>resilver</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rebuild process does not scan the whole block pointer tree.
Instead, it only scans the spacemap objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The IO from rebuild is sequential, because it rebuilds metaslabs one
by one in sequential order.</p></li>
<li><p>The rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries. For example,
if 10 64K blocks are allocated contiguously, then rebuild will fix
640K at one time. So rebuild process will generate larger IOs than
resilver.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the benefits above, there is one price to pay. The rebuild
process cannot verify block checksums, since it doesn’t have block
pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the rebuild process requires support from on-disk format,
and <strong>only</strong> works on draid and mirror vdevs. Resilver, on the other
hand, works with any vdev (including draid).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rebuild process creates larger IOs, the drives will not
necessarily see large IO requests. The block device queue parameter
<em>/sys/block/</em>/queue/max_sectors_kb* must be tuned accordingly. However,
since the rebuild IO is already sequential, the benefits of enabling
larger IO requests might be marginal.</p>
<p>At this point, redundancy has been fully restored without adding any new
drive to the pool. If another drive is offlined, the pool is still able
to do IO:</p>

				<p><h2>Small, portable laser pointers could be used to guide lightning strikes, with a study suggesting the technology may prevent bolts from sparking wildfires, a researcher told AFP Thursday.</h2></p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>A team of international scientists have shown storm clouds could be “short-circuited” by using a hollow laser — like a pipe of light — to deliver particles into the clouds and draw lightning strikes, research co-author Professor Andrey Miroshnichenko from the University of New South Wales in Canberra told AFP.</p>
<p>In lab tests, the team — which also included scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) — successfully used a laser tractor beam to direct the path of an electrical discharge to specific targets, Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>In the past, high-powered lasers were needed to achieve similar results, making the technique dangerous, costly and inaccurate.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

				<div><p>But the new research suggested that small, hand-held lasers could be used in the field within the next decade, he said.</p>
<p>“It turns out that to deliver particles, you do not need high-intensity lasers, even low intensity like your laser pointer will be already enough,” Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>Using a tractor beam with a hollow centre, micro-particles in the air could be heated up and delivered to a specific point and trigger an electrical discharge.</p></div>

				<div><p>Although it is yet to be tested outside a lab, the technique could potentially be used to control dry lightning strikes, infamous for sparking large blazes including several major <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/social-media-fakes-australia-bushfire-disinformation/">bushfires in Australia</a> and the western US in the past year, Miroshnichenko added.</p>
<p>“We can imagine a future where this technology may induce electrical discharge from passing lightning, helping to guide it to safe targets and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/makeshift-hospital-saving-dozens-of-koalas-injured-in-bushfires/">catastrophic fires</a>,” co-researcher Vladlen Shvedov, from the ANU Research School of Physics, said.</p>
<p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19183-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications last month</a>, also involved Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar and the University of California in Los Angeles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

Let's take a walk through the core of it all: data structures. What are they and why are they so important? A 'hello' to a reader that might have missed our talk on <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">Memory management</a>, where we delved into what happens to our code in variable assignment. Do take a look, even if it's a refresher you're looking for.</p>
<p>Alright then. What is a data structure?</p>
<p>It's a way of organizing data. Say we have a couple of friends coming over for our fortnightly game night( ah...the things on our to-do list). We need snacks, a number of people expected to be there, a list of activities to partake. I can go on and on. So how do we organize this in say a program we want to implement to fix the hustle of planning? How do we store the things to be done or the items to be purchased? It's all data in the end. We need structure. We need data structures. The how of getting our data and manipulating it from these structures are our algorithms.</p>
<p>Right back to our game, who will do what? </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604914703881/MPT41cxif.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="adeolu-eletu-DqWEAOHsAvc-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>How do we decide what comes before what in terms of structuring this data? Does our simple program make it easy to retrieve this information? Is it fast enough? What about efficiency?</p>
<p>Whatever kind of application we are talking about, we need a data structure(s) that will allow traversing, insertion, searching, deletion( in case the last casserole was outright nasty), sorting, or merging of bits of data. Call it CRUD with extra steps.</p>
<p>As from the Memory management article, we got data, then collections of data. It's all data. While memory allocation might not be something we think of with javascript of even Python, it holds water when doing <strong>C</strong> or <strong>C++</strong>. So keep this in mind. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, we group data structures, much like data types in itself, as:</p>
<p>a) Primitive</p>
<p>b) Non-primitive</p>
<p>Primitive structures would hold primitive data types; that is the <em>chars</em>, the <em>int</em> the <em>float</em>. Basically, data types that hold a single value.</p>
<p>Non-primitive structures, on the other hand, break down to <strong>linear</strong> (which holds data in a sequence) and of course <strong>non-linear</strong>. Hold your breath in case you lost it a moment there. We'll go into the details soon enough.</p>
<p>As of now, you have a general idea, a scope if you may, of what structures involve.
They are quite a number.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next couple of weeks, we'll be covering some of these structures. Unraveling them to bits and pieces. Finding what makes them tick as so and getting why many a time, developers new and old alike, have challenges addressing them. Stick a while, I cannot wait for our next piece in this!</p>

  <p><time>10 Nov 2020</time>
  </p>
  <p>Haskell’s type classes and deriving facilities are a killer feature for type safety and extensibility.
Over nearly 30 years they’ve acquired quite a bit of cruft and language extensions.
With <code>DerivingVia</code>, we now have the ability to dramatically simplify the deriving story.</p>

<p>This post outlines a change to the <em>language</em> that would hopefully be adopted with the next version of the language standard.
They get less reasonable and more dramatic as the post goes on.</p>



<p>GHC has a ton of extensions that only serve to unlock additional type classes to the “stock” deriving strategy.
<code>Derive{Functor,Foldable,Traversable,Generic,Lift,etc}</code>.
We can remove all of these extensions by folding them into the <code>stock</code> deriving strategy.</p>



<p><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> is a footgun.
It allows you to write any type class in a <code>deriving</code> clause.
It pastes in an “empty” instance, relying on <code>DefaultSignatures</code> to fill in the values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- With DeriveAnyClass:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span>

<span>-- Without:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><code>DefaultSignatures</code> is used to give a single default implementation of a type class if the underlying type matches a more restrictive constraint.
This is primarily used to provide <code>Generic</code>-based implementations with very little syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>-- with DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>default</span> <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> 

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- without DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By privileging a single default, it makes any other possible defaults less useful and less discoverable.</p>

<p>The <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> utility is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> <span>a</span>

<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This extension is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>, also.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>newtype</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- with DerivingVia</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that there’s only two strategies, we can get rid of <code>DerivingStrategies</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- After</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Currently, you must write the complete type in a <code>DerivingVia</code> clause.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Y</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be cumbersome for a very large type.</p>

<pre><code>newtype App a = App (ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO)) a)
    deriving
        ( Functor
        , Applicative
        , Monad
        , MonadReader ()
        , MonadError ()
        , MonadState ()
        )
      via
        ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO))
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also annoyingly repetitive, and can lead to errors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>-- copy/paste error</span>
<span>data</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bar</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A wildcard can be used to indicate either:</p>

<p>a. The underlying type of a <code>newtype</code>, or 
b. The type of the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>

<span>-- no more copy paste error</span>
<span>data</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bar</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>

<span>-- mmmm nice and clean</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>(</span><span>ExceptT</span> <span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>StateT</span> <span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>ReaderT</span> <span>()</span> <span>IO</span><span>))</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
        <span>)</span>
      <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>There are two ways to derive things: <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> and attached deriving.
Attached deriving is redundant, but convenient.
<code>StandaloneDeriving</code> is more powerful, but less convenient.
Attached deriving clauses don’t work with <code>GADTs</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before:</span>

<span>-- GADT must use standalone to specify a context</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The problem with the above proposal is that it carries a significant syntax cost.
The keyword <code>deriving</code> is repeated for each instance, the keyword <code>instance</code> is repeated, the <code>via _</code> clause is repeated, and the type name is repeated.
Multiple instances should be derivable with the same context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>(</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>via</span> 
        <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this block, we define the <code>ToJSON</code> and <code>FromJSON</code> instances using the same <code>Generically</code> viatype.
We can still use <code>_</code> to refer to the type, since we know the type we’re deriving for: <code>Foo</code>.
This recovers the syntax convenience of “attached deriving.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>...</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>App</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>instance</span> 
            <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also recovers the convenience of attached deriving.
Let’s look at the main <em>point</em> - GADTs.
Otherwise we could just remove <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> (with the nice benefit/tragedy of banning orphan derived instance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>

<span>-- old</span>

<span>-- new</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>Some</span>
    <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- generally,</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>SomeGadtType</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SomeContextOn</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>_</code> refers to the type name, without any variables applied.
So you need to apply the type variables in the instance head.
That’s a bit annoying, but maybe it’s fine</p>



<p>GHC provides a <code>newtype Stock a = Stock a</code> that hooks in to <code>DerivingVia</code> somehow.
Now we’re down to one deriving strategy.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Stock</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “deprivileges” the <code>Stock</code> deriving classes.</p>



<p>OK, so maybe you don’t like getting rid of attached deriving.
Let’s get rid of standalone deriving instead.
We need <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orphan derived instances (shame on you)</li>
  <li>Specifying a context for GADTs and allow application of type variables</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>Show</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>-- generally,</span>
            <span>(</span><span>SomeContext</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>SomeClass</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type variable <code>f</code> is in scope from the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/quickdudley/status/1328068260659482624">@quickdudley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnotm/status/1327998875563683845">@nnotm</a> have correctly pointed out that you also want to be able to define instances of a class at the definition module of a class.
These are perfectly valid instances, and so we must keep <code>StandaloneDeriving</code>.</p>



<p>Alright, post is done.
These ideas are certainly controversial and Bad, but <em>man</em> wouldn’t it be nice to have a simpler story around deriving and type class instances?
The current story is so complex, and I think we can genuinely simplify Haskell-the-language by trimming some fat here.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/am_i_tom/status/1327992136151789568">@i_am_tom</a> posted a reference to the <a href="https://github.com/tysonzero/ghc-proposals/blob/concrete-class-dictionaries/proposals/0000-concrete-class-dictionaries.md">Concrete Class Dictionaries</a> GHC proposal, which subsumes a lot of this.</p>

    <p>It's November 2020. There is no cure for COVID-19. What can we do to prevent the disaster?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at several simulations of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>I recommend to visit website from desktop for better experience. Phone may has performance issues.</p>
    <h3>Simulation rules</h3>
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Desease lasts a long time: <strong>2 to 5 weeks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30%</strong> of people develop severe symptoms. They are especially vulnerable in a case of a lack of medical care due to overwhelmed medical facilities or weak healthcare systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3%</strong> of people are destined to die. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/pdf/3000168/COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"> [Source]</a>. It is due to genetic and age reasons. We are assuming we can save the people through vaccination or isolation. Unfortunately as of November 2020 there are no vaccines approved for public use.</p>
    <h4>Possible states of a person</h4>
    <p><span id="guide-healty"></span> - a healthy person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-ill"></span> - a sick person. They infect other individuals in a small area around them.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-serious"></span> - a seriously sick person with severe symptoms. They die if the medical system is overloaded. We assume the healthcare system  can handle a maximum of 200 patients at a time. Also, severely ill patients move much slower than other people.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-dead"></span> - a dead person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-immunity"></span> - a recovered perso. We assume they have developed an immunity and can not get reinfected.</p>
    <h4>Modificators</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-mask"></span> - a person with mask. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Mask retains up to 50% of exhaled viruses</a>. Also it retains up to 40% of inhaled viruses. If both persons
            wear masks a synergy effect appears.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-screen"></span> - a person with screen. Screen additionally protects against infection.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-both"></span> - a person with screen and mask.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <h3>Virus in a small virtual city</h3>
    <p>There is a virtual city with population of 2 000 people. People contact each other as usual. No measures are taken. What could go wrong? Check it.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-small-city">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-small-city" onclick="startButton('small-city', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-small-city">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-small-city" onclick="resetButton('small-city')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>At the end of simulation you will see that everyone get desease. Results may vary, but I had a disaster my first simulation. I have got up to 1500 sick people at same time andui
        600 dead people at the end. These are 75% and 30%, respectively. Each person with severe symptoms died.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people</h3>
    <p>We have not taken any measures to protect people. Obviously, we can isolate patients in hospitals. Let's be honest, complete isolation is not possible. Patients will still
        be in contact with service personnel, such as doctors, janitors, couriers. So the virus can be passed on, but it happens less likely.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this affects the spread of the virus. <strong>It is a perfect scenario!</strong> Be prepared it takes long time. I recommend to move ahead after 90th day,
        there is nothing interesting in the following days.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>Wow! In my simulation there were so few infections that medical care was enough for everyone. Over time, the number of people with immunity increased. At some point, the
        patients were in contact only with people with immunity and could not spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>My result is 70 people who died over 498 days of pandemy. Exactly 3% that are in the genetics of people. So, what is your result?</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life</h3>
    <p>Sadly, not all people observe isolation. And alas, not all sick people know that they are ill. There is no scientific work reporting how many people are asymptomatic. In my
        city one clinic said 25% of its positive tests were from people with no signs of illness. Let's take this number as a basis. <strong>25% of those infected will not show
            symptoms and will move freely around the city.</strong></p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Well, the burden on the healthcare system is still less than in the very first scenario. But a cemeteries are overcrowded again.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life. But with masks and screens</h3>
    <p>May be masks and screens will help? Of course not all people wear them. Let's say <strong>10% of people wear screens and 50% of people wear masks</strong>.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Hmm. Although the effect is small, it is there. Why masks have not worked? Actually they worked. But if you have chance of infection as 5%, 20 contacts turns it to 74%,
        that's it! How many contacts do you have in pub or in club? Do you consider you are breathing the same air with all the pub visitors?</p>
    <h3>Isolation + masks + screens + self-isolation</h3>
    <p>So, our goal is to reduce the number of contacts. It's time for self-isonation. Don't forget to build houses for everyone in our virtual city in advance.</p>
    <p>In this case we have a chance to isolate people who do not know they are ill. One more modification in this simulation is prevention of infection through the walls.</p>
    <p>I live in Russia. So I will draw on the experience of my country. The Moscow mayor's office has obliged business to send <strong>30% of employee to work from home</strong>.
        Let's check what happens when this order is respected.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-selfisolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-selfisolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>This set of measures has shown maximum efficiency. About 70% of people did not even get infected by the end of the simulation.</p>
    <p>This is most effective step in fight with epidemy. </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3% of people are destined to die due to their genetics</li>
        <li>30% of people need medical attention due to their genetics</li>
        <li>there is NO cure for the virus.</li>
        <li>Virus control is about probabilities</li>
        <li>We must reduce human contact to reduce the probability of infection</li>
        <li>Forced contacts should be protected with masks, screens, antiseptics.</li>
    </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>It’s time for the holidays and what better way to share love and memories with your family than to create an old-school, vintage movie? You don’t need a time-machine to go back to the 50s or 60s to rmake your homevideo look like a vintage movie. All you need is FFmpeg, some imagination, and perhaps the rest of this guide 🙂 </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at how you can use FFmpeg to make your videos look like old-school/vintage/retro-styled movies, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s Do I Mean By A Vintage Movie?</h2>



<p>Well, good question! </p>



<p><strong>My definition of an old-school movie is a movie with a low frame-rate (like 15 fps), lots of scratches and film-grain to give an aged look, and a sepia tint to it!</strong></p>



<p>Let’s see how we can achieve all of this using FFmpeg.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I shall be using the “Touchdown Pass” sequence from <a href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiph</a> to illustrate the steps. It’s a 20 second video, but for the sake of this tutorial, I’ll be cutting it to 10 seconds using FFmpeg (<a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/">here’s how to do that</a>).</p>



<p>Let’s get started! </p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 1: Changing the Frame Rate using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>The first step is to “speed” up the video. Let’s take the video back to pre-30fps or pre-60fps days and take it all the way down to 10 fps. This gives the video an old-school look right off the bat! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-10sec.mp4 \
-filter:v fps=fps=10 \
td-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is the sped-up video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479524704" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 2: Give The Video a Vintage Look using FFmpeg’s filters</h2>



<p>Next, let’s change the rich, wonderful colors and bring a sepia-link tint to the entire video. This can be done using FFmpeg’s in-built <code>curves</code> filter. You can use the <code>curves</code> filter to change the amount of R, G, B in a frame and specify the “curves” that govern the change or shift in colors. </p>



<p>Luckily for us, FFmpeg has a pre-defined <code>vintage</code> filter that works pretty well, I must say! Here is the commandline to convert our sped-up video into a “vintage” looking video. Simple, right?</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-fast.mp4 \
-vf curves=vintage \
td-vintage-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here’s the result of the <code>curves=vintage</code> filter on our footall video.</p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479525304" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 3: Getting a Film Grain Overlay and Resizing It</h2>



<p>As the final step, let’s add a lot of film-grain and “scratches” to make our video look like something that was shot on film, stored in a dusty old cupboard, and discovered 40 years later! </p>



<p>I found a fantastic “old school” film overlay on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MZb7qTenE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source link</a>) with a download link. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1200" height="675" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_MZb7qTenE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The video’s size is <code>1440x1080</code> pixels and so I had to resize it to <code>1920x1080</code> to match the size of my input video. </p>



<p>Here is the command to resize a video using FFmpeg using the the <code>scale</code> filter. I’ve stored the output video as <code>oldFilm1080.mp4</code>.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i old-film-grain.wmv \
-vf scale=1920:1080,setsar=1:1 \
oldFilm1080.mp4</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Step 4: Add the Overlay To Your Video</h2>



<p>Now we have two videos with us – </p>



<ol><li>our old-school film-grain-scratchy video</li><li>our vintage-looking, sped-up football video. </li></ol>



<p>Now all that’s left to do is to overlay them on each other and enjoy the fruits of <s>our</s> FFmpeg’s labor! </p>



<p>Here’s the commandline to achieve that. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe \
-i oldFilm1080.mp4 \
-i td-vintage-fast.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.25[fg];\
[1][fg]overlay[out]" \
-map [out] \
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
touchdown-vintage.mp4</code></pre>



<p>So, what’s going on here? </p>



<ul><li>we provide two input videos to FFmpeg </li><li>using <code>filter_complex</code>, we use <code>colorchannelmixer</code> to overlay by modifying the alpha channel of the film-grain video that is referred to as <code>[0]</code> and and let’s call the output <code>[fg]</code>. It’s black and white, so modifying only the alpha is good enough for our use case. The syntax is as follows <code>colorchannelmixer=rr:rg:rb:ra:gr:gg:gb:ga:br:bg:bb:ba:ar:ag:ab:aa</code>. </li><li>we are modifying only the alpha, and so, we modify only the <code>aa</code> (output’s alpha) to <code>0.25</code>.</li><li>then, we use the vintage-looking football video (referred to as <code>[1]</code>) and overlay them both using the <code>overlay</code> filter to create an interim output stored in a variable called <code>[out]</code>. This is shown in the commands –&gt; <code>[1][fg]overlay[out]</code></li><li>then, we encode the interim output to give us the final video using H.264 with <code>crf=18</code> which should give us a good quality video.</li></ul>







<p><strong>Here is what the final output looks like! Cool, isn’t it? </strong></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529512" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>And, here’s how it looks side-by-side the original video. </p>

<p>Now you can change the opacity of the alpha channels, use a different film grain video, or use a different <code>curves</code> function, but, the process won’t change much. </p>



<p>Hope you all have a lot of fun making “<strong>vintage</strong>” videos this holiday season and please let me know in the comments how it went! Please create some fun videos, share them with your loved ones, and have a few laughs 🙂 </p>

                <p>Properties are a really nice feature of modern languages, and I've recently
                    gotten attached to them in Kotlin. For a while
                    I wasn't comfortable with the idea of 'fields' performing arbitrary computation,
                    but having used them for a few months now I'm really enjoying the simplicity -
                    <em>especially</em> when moving back to Java!</p>
                <p>Having given it some thought, I wanted to lay out a case in support of
                    properties which highlights their benefits over directly accessing fields (which
                    is mostly about getters/setters, but nonetheless), and how we can establish some
                    guidelines on when properties should not be used to avoid the issue of
                    arbitrary computation causing side effects or other unexpected behavior.</p>
                
                <p>In short, a property is <abbr title="Features which aid readability or ease of use but do not impact semantics.">syntax sugar</abbr> for getter/setter methods that look
                    like fields. Instead of having to use the methods <code>item.getQuantity()</code> and
                    <code>item.setQuantity()</code>, we can access the property <code>item.quantity</code> and set it
                    using <code>item.quantity = 1</code>, exactly like a field. The compiler transforms property
                    access and assignment to use the appropriate getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
                </p>
                <p>The most noteworthy consequence of this is, in my opinion, allowing <em>validation
                    on assigment</em>. For example, <code>item.quantity</code> may be defined as follows (in Kotlin):</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Item</span> {
    <span>var</span> <span>quantity</span>: <span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>
        <span>set</span>(value) {
            require(value &gt;= <span>0</span>) <span>//throws if negative</span>
            <span>field</span> = value
        }
}
</pre>
<pre><span>
  <i onclick="openDemo('item-property', this)"></i>
</span>item.<span>quantity</span> = <span>-10</span>;
</pre>
                
                <p>The largest benefit of properties is replacing field use, which has a massive
                    amount of drawbacks, with methods instead. In languages like C++ and Java that
                    don't have properties, the best practice is to keep all fields private and
                    manually create getters and setters. More modern languages, like C# and Kotlin,
                    use properties for this instead which can do that automatically.</p>
                <p>Most of the following points are also benefits of using getters/setters over
                    fields, and then properties step in to provide the extra bit of syntax sugar icing on
                    the cake.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Property getters/setters can have different <abbr title="public/private and friends">access modifiers</abbr>, allowing for
                        fields which are read-only for external use but still mutable within the class.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: In Kotlin, <code>val&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;private&nbsp;set</code>
                                defines a <code>counter</code> field that can be publicly accessed but not modified (unless within the class).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getters/setters can be used to maintain <abbr title="A (mathematical) property which is expected to hold true in all cases

For example, a unit vector (3D) has the invariant x² + y² + z² == 1.">invariants</abbr> and perform other
                        validation work, such as <code>quantity&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> in the opening example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since getters/setters are methods, the implementation can be changed without
                        breaking either <abbr title="Application Programming Interface

The interface of the *source* code">API</abbr> or <abbr title="Application Binary Interface

The interface of the *compiled* code">ABI</abbr> compatibility.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A <code>Vector</code> class could have <code>x/y/z</code> properties, but
                                change the implementation to use a component array <code>[x, y, z]</code> instead without issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, getters/setters can be inlined during optimization to speed up performance at the cost of ABI compatibility.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties can be used in interfaces since they're backed by methods, while fields require getters/setters to be defined for them. Notably, these getters/setters would still need to have fields defined in the implementing class to handle their values, while a property can handle that automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties can be used for methods which often behave like fields, but
                        cannot be implemented with one due to subtypes requiring computation or
                        other restrictions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <code>List#size()</code> generally doesn't need computation and returns the
                                value of a field, but some implementations (such as a <abbr title="A form of linked list which doesn't track its size, comes from Lisp

Honestly google it, this text box can't do it justice">cons list</abbr>) might.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whether <code>List#size()</code> should be a property is certainly debatable, but with how frequently collections are used I think it's almost a necessity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties are a <em>single unit</em>. Getters/setters are located in the same
                        location in the source code as the property declaration, making it easier to
                        fully understand a field as opposed to having them defined in separate locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties almost always have syntax sugar for providing default
                        implementations of <code>get/set</code> (if it's not already done automatically). In Kotlin, <code>val property</code> provides a default
                        getter while <code>var property</code> provides both a getter and setter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging properties is possible without a dedicated debugger by using
                        getters/setters. This may be minor for large languages, but if your language
                        doesn't have an IDE or still in development this is <em>extremely</em> useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Readability is often increased, albeit debatable. I personally find <code>item.quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code> to
                        be more readable than <code>item.setQuantity(1)</code>, especially in large chains.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, properties imply 'simple' behavior, like fields, as opposed to complex
                        computation that some methods may perform. We'll talk about this in detail soon.
                    </li>

                            <span>So what are the downsides?</span>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think there are two notable downsides to having properties. First, the
                    performance difference between field access and method calls can be significant,
                    especially in low level languages. Second, field access has clear, well-defined
                    behavior while a method call could effectively do anything, thus making it
                    harder to reason about code. Let's dig in to both of these.</p>
                
                <p>Field access is almost always language primitive, and is therefore faster than
                    doing the work of a method call (which then has to access <em>something</em> anyways).</p>
                <p>That said, compiler optimizations like <abbr title="Replacing a method call with it's implementation">inlining</abbr> can easily resolve this for
                    simple properties. In more complex cases, this is actually where properties are
                    most useful - a field itself wasn't sufficient, so the alternative would have
                    been a method call or sacrificing validation anyways.</p>
                <p>In low level languages where memory layout is often important, knowing a field
                    access corresponds to a memory lookup (and not arbitrary computation) can be
                    important. In higher level languages, particularly Object Oriented ones that
                    often encapsulate fields behind methods anyways, I don't believe this
                    distinction is as necessary.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                            <span>
                                <a href="#problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                                    <i></i>
                                </a>
                            </span>
                            <span>Problem 2: Arbitrary Computation</span>
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we've made our way to what I believe is the core issue: since
                    properties can perform arbitrary computation, it is unclear what potential
                    behavior getting/setting a property may have. The extreme example here, of
                    course, is deleting the entire file system. Fields on the other hand have
                    clearly defined behavior - get or set the value, nothing more.</p>
                <p>However, these type of assumptions are not unique to properties. We apply the
                    same assumptions to methods (and honestly everything) as well. I often presume
                    that <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX(x)</code> have 'simple' behavior, but they could use lazy
                    initialization, have unexpected validation checks, or cause side-effects and
                    other unexpected behavior
                    like a database <code>getConnection()</code>. Naming is one of the two hard problems in computer science,
                    likely because we carry assumptions with us that may not always fit.</p>
                <p>That said, these assumptions …</p></article></div>

<p>Most programmers I know started programming out of sheer curiosity and joy. Joy is what keeps one motivated to keep up with the changing landscape of technology. It’s what keeps one happy. That is why I am recommending these 10 best books for programmers, books I really enjoyed reading. These are the books that I keep picking up and coming back to or have fond memories of. These are also the books that I hardly see recommended elsewhere, except for a few classics that are certainly worth repeating. And now I would like to share these books with you.</p>

<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ALozx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Pragmatic Programmer<br></a><sub>Your Journey to Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="230" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-pragmatic-programmer-230x300.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>I would recommend any programmer to read this book. It contains a lot of wisdom, tips, and advice. Most of it is pretty basic but therein lies the beauty. The first edition released in 1999 and was getting pretty dated. Despite it being old it was still highly recommended. To my surprise they released a new edition 20 years later, all up-to-date! Now you’ve got no excuses left to not read this book. A wonderful book that you surely will be referring back to over and over again, I know I do.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Coding Career Handbook<br></a><sub>Guides, Principles, Strategies, and Tactics – from Code Newbie to Senior Dev</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg 196w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook.jpg 311w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px"></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the The Pragmatic Programmer , I consider this book a must-read. It focuses on the bigger picture and your career, not just about writing code. This book is the reason I started this blog in the first place! A great book for any ambitious programmer and want to take your career to the next level.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ulPQI">Apprenticeship Patterns<br></a><sub>Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="229" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg 229w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns.jpeg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px"></figure></div>



<p>If you’re new to programming, making the same mistakes as the programmers that have gone before you can be costly and detrimental for your career. Let this book guide you on avoiding these same mistakes. This book is similar to the ones mentioned above and makes for a nice addition. It’s split up into smaller sections that can be read in any order you’d like, this makes it a fun and easy read.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3prQVAU">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg 243w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"></figure></div>



<p>This is the book that taught me how code and was the first book I read on the subject of programming. It made learning new programming languages that much easier. Ever since I read this book it seems I’ve always been one step ahead of the herd. This book is about learning the fundamentals of programming and C++ and less about games. It merely uses games as an example to reinforce programming concepts. This book was a lot of fun to read and because it uses games as a theme it keeps one motivated.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/35sQDSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Programming Game AI by Example</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="201" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg 201w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example.jpg 335w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"></figure></div>



<p>To be honest I have not read this book in it’s entirety yet as I currently lack the time to do so. But I am really excited about this one and can’t wait to read it in combination with learning a new programming language: Rust. This book makes use of C++ but I’d figure these languages are similar enough as to implement the same ideas in Rust. I’ve put this book on this list because of the pure excitement it makes me feel. I would recommend to at least peruse this book to see if it resonates with you.</p>

<p>This is a book I got recommended, I read it, I loved it. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it. And now I recommend it to you! It’s a really fun read and I could hardly put it down. This book really is written like a novel and packed with great lessons. Go read it! There is also a part two of sorts: The Unicorn Project. I hear it contains much of the same lessons, only told with a different story. I have yet to read it but will certainly do so in the near future.</p>

<p>I adore this book. It’s a book I keep coming back to over and over. It’s about programming patterns with a game theme once again. Note that the patterns here are not only for games! Some of them are game specific but most of them aren’t. It’s a fun read with beautiful hand drawn diagrams. Bob Nystrom clearly has put a lot of love in his book. You can read the web version for free <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>!</p>

<![CDATA[Learning all VSCode shortcuts evolved my developing habits in unexpected ways]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Python is one of the languages that is witnessing incredible growth and popularity year by year. In 2017, Stack overflow calculated that python would beat all other programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest-growing programming language in the world.</p>
<p>Python is one of the most popular general-purpose, high-level programming languages in modern times. It is an elementary and widely used programming language because of its code readability. </p>
<p>The term <strong>general-purpose</strong> means that Python can be used for a variety of applications. And the term <strong>high-level language</strong> means it's close to human language. The main advantage of high-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter. Python is an interpreted language because, during execution, each line is interpreted to the machine language on-the-go.</p>
<h2 id="history">History 📜</h2>
<p>Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)" target="_blank">ABC language</a>. It was developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> and was first released in 1991. While Guido van Rossum was implementing Python, he read the published scripts from Monty Python’s Flying Circus. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929/">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</a> is a BBC Comedy TV series from 1969+. It is a highly viewed TV series and is rated 8.8 on IMDB.
Python programming language is highly rated too. According to a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">Stack Overflow survey</a>, Python has overtaken Java in popularity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/egu2Nzo.png" alt="python overtaken"></p>
<p>Fig: Python has overtaken Java in popularity</p>


<p>Python is named after the comedy television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. It is not named after the Python snake.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy 🧠</h2>
<p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">The Zen of Python</a>, which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features 💼</h2>
<p>As a programming language, the features of Python brought to the table are many. Some of the most significant features of Python are:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Features of Python</p>


<h3 id="easy-to-learn">🎯 Easy to Learn</h3>
<p>Python is a very developer-friendly language, which means that anyone can learn to code it in a couple of hours or days.</p>
<h3 id="readability">🎯 Readability</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for Python’s rapid growth is the simplicity of its syntax. The language reads almost like plain English, making it easy to write complex programs. Here is an example</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
b = <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> a <span>is</span> b:
    print(<span>"Hi"</span>)
a = <span>2000</span>
print(<span>"Yeah!"</span>) <span>if</span> a % <span>2</span> == <span>0</span> <span>else</span> print(<span>"No!"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="object-oriented-language">🎯 Object-Oriented Language</h3>
<p>Python is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented languages</a>. The term object-oriented means it supports the concept of classes, method, object encapsulation, and many more. Here is an example code of OOP</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Car</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self, color, model, year</span>):</span>
        self.color = color
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
</code></pre>
<h3 id="free-open-source-and-cross-platform">🎯 Free, Open Source and Cross-Platform</h3>
<p>Python is an open-source programming language, which means that anyone can create and contribute to its development. Python has an online forum where thousands of coders gather daily to improve this language further. Along with this, Python is free to download and use in any operating system, be it Windows, Mac, or Linux.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-user-interfaces">🎯 Graphical User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Python supports a wide array of GUIs which can easily be imported and make the results more visual. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt5</a> is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-memory-management">🎯 Dynamic Memory Management</h3>
<p>Python supports automatic memory management, which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory.</p>
<h3 id="exception-handling">🎯 Exception Handling</h3>
<p>Python supports exception handling, which means we can write fewer errors in code and test various scenarios that can cause an exception. Here is an example code</p>
<pre><code><span>try</span>:
    a=<span>5</span>
    b=<span>0</span>
    <span>print</span> (a/b)
<span>except</span> TypeError:
    print(<span>'Unsupported operation'</span>)
<span>except</span> ZeroDivisionError:
    <span>print</span> (<span>'Division by zero not allowed'</span>)

-------------output ----------------------
&gt; Division by zero <span>not</span> allowed
</code></pre>
<h3 id="highly-dynamic">🎯 Highly Dynamic</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most dynamic languages available in the industry today. It means that the type of a variable is decided at the run time and not in advance. Due to this feature's presence, we do not need to specify the variable's type during coding, thus saving time and increasing efficiency. Here is an example code in the C language</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    <span>int</span> a = <span>1</span>;
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d"</span>, a);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see the same code in Python.</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
print(a)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="large-standard-library">🎯 Large Standard Library</h3>
<p>Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and functions, so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.</p>
<h3 id="portable">🎯 Portable</h3>
<p>If you are running Python on Windows and you need to shift the same to either a Mac or a Linux system, you can easily achieve the same in Python without worrying about changing the code.</p>


<p>Apart from learning, Python is a very efficient language used in almost every sphere of modern computing. This makes a strong case for learning Python, even for non-programmers. Some of Python’s main applications are highlighted below:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg" alt="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Applications of Python</p>

<h3 id="web-development">📌 Web Development</h3>
<p>Python can be used to make a web application at a rapid rate. That because the frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> are uses to create these applications. Python frameworks are known for their security, scalability, and flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="game-development">📌 Game Development</h3>
<p>Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/soya3d/index_en.html">PySoy</a>, a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted">PyGame</a>, which provides functionality, and a library for game development.

<h3 id="web-scrapping">📌 Web Scrapping</h3>
<p>A python is a nifty tool for pulling a large amount of data from websites, which can help in various real-world processes, including job listings, price comparison, and so on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a> are some of the best Python-based web scraping tools.</p>
<h3 id="image-and-video-processing">📌 Image and Video Processing</h3>
<p>Image Processing is thus the process of analyzing and manipulating a digital image primarily aimed at improving its quality or for extracting some information from it, which could then be put to some use. Python offers many libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc.html">OpenCV</a>.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-application">📌 Embedded Application</h3>
<p>Python can be used to create <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C">Embedded C</a> software for embedded applications. The most well-known embedded application could be the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which uses Python for its computing. We can also use it as a computer or like a simple embedded board to perform high-level computations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion 👌</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Python is capable of handling almost any development requirement. No matter what field you take up, Python is rewarding. In the last few years, Python applications have gained newfound traction in Data Science, particularly in Machine Learning. Python is a great way to start a developer's journey. </p>

  20 minutes

            </p>

            <p>Every story needs a hero. But, not all heroes are the same. Some of them have superpowers, and some are ordinary people. This story’s hero is just a regular software developer who works in a small team on a medium-size application. Our hero loves his job most of the time, except when he sends a test push notification to thousands of their customers in production, like a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/01-push-notifications.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One day, his boss came with a new project. “We need to build a new complex application for our new important customer.” Nice, our hero loves challenges! “But we need to do it fast, as we have a short deadline because they have an important marketing event!” Ok, how fast do we need to build an app? “It needs to be ready for yesterday. And it needs to be real-time and scalable!”</p>

<p>The new project is a big challenge for our hero, as he never did that kind of project. Can he even do it?</p>

<p>“You can do it,” his boss says. “I also hired a famous consultant to help you.” That’s awesome! Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>After a full-day meeting with the consultant, and a whiteboard full of weird diagrams, the plan was simple: “Just use Kubernetes!”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/02-consultant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But our hero doesn’t know Kubernetes. And there’s no time to learn it now. What should he do?</p>

<p>He started wondering if he is the only one who doesn’t know Kubernetes. Is he good enough for this job?</p>

<p>Our hero spent a sleepless night in front of his computer with his faithful sidekick, a rubber duck. He tried to learn as much as he can about this new technology. But he ended up more confused and tired.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/03-sidekick.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="you-should-try-serverless-graphql">You should try Serverless GraphQL</h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, our hero’s faithful sidekick said, “you should try serverless GraphQL.”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/04-try-serverless-graphql.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Was he dreaming? And what the heck is serverless GraphQL? He knows what serverless is, but what’s GraphQL?</p>

<h3 id="whats-graphql">What’s GraphQL</h3>

<p>Do you remember when Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">said</a>, “our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5?” It was a long time ago, back in 2012, when HTML5 was in its early days.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Facebook mobile app was an HTML5 web app embedded in the native mobile shell. They served all the news feed updates as HTML data from the server. However, HTML5 was in its early days, and the mobile web views were not performant enough, so the app wasn’t stable and scalable enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/05-fb-mobile-app.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2012, Facebook’s engineering team started rebuilding their mobile and switching to the native iOS and Android apps. They evaluated different options for delivering the news feed data, including RESTful services  and Facebook Query Language (FQL).</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">“GraphQL: A data query language”</a> article in 2015, Lee Byron wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were frustrated with the differences between the data we wanted to use in our apps and the server queries they required. We don’t think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This frustration led the Facebook engineering team to rethink the way they serve data to their mobile application. Instead of returning a full model with a lot of unnecessary data, they tried to develop a new system to return only the data the application needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/06-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2015, they <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">announced</a> GraphQL, an open-source data query language. The idea behind GraphQL was simple, the client defines the data structure, and the server provides a JSON response with precisely the same format.</p>

<p>For example, the client wants to get the user with a specified ID. However, the application needs only the user’s name, a profile photo with a specific size, and the first five friend connections. Instead of sending two or three different requests to the RESTful API, with GraphQL, you can send a request similar to the one in the image below. And the response will be the JSON with the same structure, as you can see on the right side of the same image.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/07-an-example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That sounds nice and smart. But why should our hero care about GraphQL? He doesn’t have the same problem Facebook had.</p>

<p>The problem Facebook’s engineering team had was the leading cause for inventing GraphQL. However, that’s not the only problem GraphQL solves. If you have one of the following symptoms, GraphQL might be the cure for the problems your application faces, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distinct front end clients for multiple platforms, such as web and mobile, have different data requirements.</li>
  <li>Your back end serves data to your client apps from different sources. For example, your app has SQL and NoSQL databases, and it connects to some external systems.</li>
  <li>Your app has a complex state and caching managements for both front end and back end.</li>
  <li>Slow pages, especially on mobile, caused by multiple dependant HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not complete, and GraphQL can bring even more benefits to your application. Some of the main characteristics of GraphQL are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It defines a data shape. The request always specifies the response’s form, which makes requests more predictable and easier to use.</li>
  <li>It’s hierarchical. Its strict relation between objects with graph-structured data simplifies getting data from multiple sources.</li>
  <li>It’s strongly typed. It can give you descriptive error messages before you run a query.</li>
  <li>It’s a protocol, not storage. Each GraphQL field is backed by a function on the back end, which allows you to connect it to any storage you want in the background.</li>
  <li>It’s introspective. You can query the GraphQL server for the types it supports. This gives you built-in documentation and also a base for a powerful toolset.</li>
  <li>It’s version free. The shape of the data is always defined by the client’s request, which means adding additional fields to your model will not affect your client application until you change the query itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine data from multiple sources using RESTful API, you often send multiple HTTP requests and then connect data on the client-side. This works fine in perfect conditions. However, users don’t always use your app in ideal conditions. They are often on mobile with a limited or unstable network. Or they live in Australia, and each request is a few hundred milliseconds slower.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/08-multiple-data-sources.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>With GraphQL, you can archive the same with a single request. This will push a bit more load to the server-side, but that works just fine in most cases. It’s even better when you don’t own the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/09-graphql-request.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="where-to-start-with-graphql">Where to start with GraphQL</h3>

<p>With GraphQL, you start by shaping your data using types. For example, if you are building a blog, you will have an author and a post, similar to the following code snippet. Each post will have its id, a name, a title, and an author. Authors have their ids, names, and a list of their posts.</p>

<p>As you can see, types also define a relation between an author and posts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>posts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>author</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have types, you can build your GraphQL schema. In the code snippet below, we define two queries: get author by ID and get posts by title. Each of these queries defines input parameters with their types and a return type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
  </span><span>getPostsByTitle</span><span>(</span><span>titleContains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>query</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GraphQL is not storage but a protocol, we need to tell GraphQL where and how it can read the data by creating resolvers. In the following code snippet, we define two resolvers: one for the author that connects to the SQL database and one for a list of posts sends an HTTP request to the blog platform API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>getAuthor(_, args){
  return sql.raw('SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = %s', args.id);
}

posts(author){
  return request(`https://api.blog.io/by_author/${author.id}`);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can run the query. As we defined queries, we can ask for an author by their ID. Relations allow us to get a list of all author’s posts in the same request. And if we ask for the author’s name for each blog post, that name will be the same as the author’s name above because it points to the same author.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>){</span><span>
    </span><span>name</span><span>
    </span><span>posts</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<p>Once we run the query, GraphQL will parse the request, then validate the types and data shape, and finally, if the first two steps are correct, it will run the query and our resolvers. Once we receive the data, it’ll look similar to the following JSON data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>,</span><span>

    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>By GraphQL specification, queries read the data. GraphQL specification also defines mutations and subscriptions. Mutations modify the existing data (i.e., add a new author or edit post), and subscriptions can notify you whenever the data is changed (i.e., it’ll run whenever the post is published).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-serverless-graphql">Why do we need serverless GraphQL?</h3>

<p>“You can always deploy your GraphQL using Kubernetes and write your resolvers by hand,” the rubber duck said, “but there’s an easier way.”</p>

<p>GraphQL makes retrieving your data from the client-side effortless, but you still need to manage and scale your infrastructure. And now, you have one central place that controls all of your requests. Unless you do the same you do with the other web applications – make your application serverless. Serverless GraphQL brings the best of both worlds: GraphQL makes you client-to-server connection effortless, and serverless simplifies maintenance of your infrastructure.</p>

<p>“Interesting, but how do I make GraphQL application serverless?”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to do that,” the rubber duck said. “You can do that manually using the familiar serverless services. For example, on AWS, you can use Amazon API …</p></div></div></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile. The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://blog.verslu.is/git/git-rebase/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.verslu.is/git/git-rebase/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>While contributing to a big OSS project it’s quite useful to know how to do a Git rebase. And more importantly: don’t be afraid of the Git force push. In this post I will write a little about the why and the how.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Finally, your change is ready for the world to see. You have gathered the courage to open that PR and hope it will get merged soon. Unfortunately reality is that your PR might be sitting there for a while. Meanwhile, development goes on and the branch you are targeting with your PR gets updated. </p>



<p>While this happens, conflicts may arise. These are conflicts between your code changes in the PR and other changes that got merged into the target branch. What you could do is merge the changes from the target branch into your PR branch. That will however give a lot of merge commits and isn’t very clean. Another way is to do a rebase.</p>



<p>To make the example more specific. On the Xamarin.Forms repository we might ask you to do a rebase whenever there are conflicts. Another reason might be that you have just opened the PR at a time where the tests or build were in a bad state. Or your code hooks into new code that is now added in the target branch. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons for a rebase.</p>



<h2>What is a Git Rebase exactly?</h2>



<p>This is where things start to get a bit scary, because it involves rewriting history due to force pushing. Let me expand on that. What will happen during a Git rebase is that the commits you want to add to the codebase are replayed on top of the target branch.</p>



<p>Imagine you want to add commits to the master branch. Since you opened the PR, new commits were added to the master branch. When you do a Git rebase you take that latest state of the master branch. Then commit by commit your changes are re-added on top of the latest state on master. After each commit is replayed there is a check if there are conflicts which you should then fix, but more on that later.</p>



<p>Have a look at the graphic below which will hopefully make it a bit more clear. On the left you see a merge, in the middle is your typically branching and on the right you can see a rebase. Imagine that the yellow dots are master and the purple ones are your branch/PR.</p>







<h2>Doing a Git Rebase</h2>



<p>Now on to the actual doing. While there are some tools that will do it with a great GUI, I will show you how to do it with the command-line. That will show what is actually going on under the hood. To make things a bit more visual I will use a GUI tool. I actually really like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitHub Desktop client (opens in a new tab)" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop client</a>, simple yet effective.</p>



<h3>RadioButton PR</h3>



<p>I have a PR that I am still working on to add a RadioButton to the Xamarin.Forms toolkit. I want to ultimately merge it into master. It has been sitting there for a while now while master has had several changes added. In the screenshot from GitHub Desktop below you can see the current state.</p>

<p>The commits marked in red at the bottom of the list are the latest changes on master at that time. Everything above that are the commits that hold the changes we want merged into master. You will see that Andrei made a great start with this PR and now I am taking over. If we take a quick look at the current state of the master branch, we will see the history as shown in the screenshot underneath.</p>

<p>I’m just showing you this so you will have a reference point and you know what to look for during the rebasing process. Note the top commit here, we expect that to show up directly under our own commits in the new history.</p>



<h3>Git Rebase onto Master</h3>



<p>The first thing we will do is open a command-line window. I will be showing you this on Windows, but everything works just the same on Mac or Linux if you will. Open the command-line and point it to the folder of your local Git repository. Then you type:</p>



<p><code>git rebase -i origin/master</code></p>



<p>The <code>git rebase</code> part is probably clear, that is the actual command. Then, we have the <code>-i</code> option. Which means you want to do an interactive rebase. The only thing this does is show you which commits are going to be rebased. You even have the option to remove commits, squash them, etc. although that is not something we will be doing now. Lastly, you see the <code>origin/master</code> part. That is the target branch. What we are doing here is basically saying: give me the latest situation on <code>origin/master</code> and replay the commits interactively from the branch I’m currently on. Does that make sense?</p>



<p>When confirming this command, you will see output like in the screenshot below.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" alt="Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w"><figcaption>Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will notice that these are the same commits as we saw in the earlier screenshot. The commits in this list which are prefixed with <code>pick</code> will be the commits that are replayed on top of the target branch. You can see all other commands below. </p>



<p>If, for some reason, there are commits in this list that you would like to exclude, just delete the lines by tapping d on your keyboard. You could also put a # in front of the line to comment it out. Or you could put the letter d or word drop in front of the line to exclude it from the rebase.</p>



<h3>Escaping Vim</h3>



<p>Don’t be alarmed, I will tell you how to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="get out of here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/" target="_blank">get out of here</a>. But the interactive part has just opened Vim for you. After you have made all the changes, simply tap <strong>esc</strong> followed by typing <code>:qw!</code>. This will exit Vim (q), save the changes (w) and not ask for confirmation (!). </p>



<p>After you did, in the best case, your rebase is done! Hooray, congrats, high fives for everyone!</p>



<h3>Dealing with Conflicts</h3>



<p>In a less ideal case, like mine, you will encounter a conflict. The changes that came in from your target branch edits were made in the same places as you made changes. The output from our rebase shows us what happened. You can see it in the screenshot underneath.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" alt="Console windows showing conflicts after rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w"><figcaption>Conflicts after rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>No worries, we got this! You can either fall back to your GUI tool and solve it there, or simply open the conflicted files with your favorite editor. Actual Visual Studio Code is very good with these conflicts.</p>



<p>In my case, I have a conflict in the <code>ButtonRenderer.cs</code> file, I will open it up in Visual Studio Code. With VS Code you can easily identify the conflict and it also provides you with some quick actions to resolve it easily, although you are free to blend the changes together and solve it that way. You can see my conflict opened in VS Code underneath.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Git Rebase</h3>



<p>After you have resolved the conflict you mark the conflict as resolved by running <code>git add {path to file}</code> or if you want to remove the file altogether, replace “add” with “rm” for remove.</p>



<p>Now note that this happened after a certain commit. So, not all commits in the list we’ve seen before, but this conflict happened after one certain commit out of that list. That means, that after we resolved the conflict, we continue the rebase by typing <code>git rebase --continue</code>. This will take the next commit from the list and apply that.</p>



<p>From that commit another conflict might emerge and you rinse and repeat until you are done. If you’ve lost faith, you can do <code>git rebase --abort</code> to undo the whole thing and go back to things as before we started this.</p>



<h3>Rewriting History</h3>



<p>Now our Git rebase is done. What I like to do is to inspect if everything went the way I expected. To do this, I look at the new commit history. You can see the history in my GUI tool in the screenshot below.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" alt="Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase" width="481" height="512" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w"><figcaption>Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Notice how the commits at the bottom, in red, are the ones that were the most recent on the current master branch. Everything above the red box, are the commits that I wanted to rebase. Effectively, we have rewritten history! </p>



<p>However, this means there is one last scary part to overcome… The Git force push.</p>



<h2>Git Force Push</h2>



<p>Because we did rewrite history our branch is in a weird state. Remotely things look differently than we have locally. Locally we suddenly have all kinds of new commits from master that are not on our remote PR branch. Because of the rebase, our local branch is the leading one. This has all the latest bits from our target branch <em>and</em> includes all of our changes.</p>



<p>To get it all back into sync, we need to do a force push. With a force push we simply push all our local changes and overwrite whatever is on the remote branch. It sounds scary and it is! Because we simply rewrite everything on the remote branch this is a destructive operation so you should handle with care. If there are commits on the remote branch that you do not have locally, they will be gone after a force push.</p>



<p>After this post was published, Steve Gordon tweeted with a thing he’d like to add to this. Since I think it was a good addition, I’ve added the tweet for you below.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great post on Git rebasing! One thing I'd add is that this is fairly safe on a personal GitHub fork and/or where you're reasonably confident no one else has pulled the remote branch you plan to force push. In other cases, rewrite remote history with caution. <a href="https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz">https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz</a></p>— Steve Gordon (@stevejgordon) <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejgordon/status/1214847644033523718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the other hand, it is not as scary if you’ve done it a couple of times. Especially when you get the hang of doing rebases, and do force pushes more often. You do need to pay attention though and make sure that you got all the changes and commits you want. That is why I like to keep my rebase operation interactive and then inspect the outcome in a GUI tool, looking at the history.</p>



<p>OK, enough with the warnings. When you are ready, simply run this command:</p>



<p><code>git push --force</code></p>



<p>That will push everything from local to remote and everything is back in sync. It’s done! Now you know how to rebase. You can do this immediately after the rebase, or first add some more changes to your branch and push them along with everything else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

				<p>(Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@sulimansallehi?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Suliman Sallehi</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-concrete-structure-1481829/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a>)</strong></p><p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not a climate denial post, it's my reflection on the state of current affairs)</p><p>The idea of Climate Change doesn't seem to have product-market fit. They've marketed it hard and for decades but it's not really taking off. They've held multiple conferences with a range of &nbsp;popular or obscure characters as keynote speakers, tried bundling it with other products, and made some pretty good cartoons and movies about. And yet society as a whole's doesn't seem to be buying it.</p><p>No one cares about the fact that Climate Change is happening and accelerating. Not really.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - there's lot's of talk <em>about</em> caring about Climate Change, but the real issue is not being seriously address by anyone. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="in-politics-climate-change-is-just-gang-sign-or-pom-poms-">In politics, Climate Change is just gang-sign. Or pom-poms.</h2><p>Climate change is often mentioned in political discussions and, for some reason, seems to be a largely partisan issue, specifically in the Western world. </p><p>It's an excellent tool to signal your affiliation. You see, if you paint it one colour, you can use it as a patch on your conservative jacket. Go Reds! When you paint it another, it's great insignia for your liberal banners. Go Blues! What colour words you use tells other people which gang you belong to.</p><p>For politicians Climate Change is mostly taken seriously as a tool too rile their base. It's very useful to shake around and manipulate your team's spirit. Rah-rah-rah!</p><p>For the conservatives, you're expected to doubt it's veracity, or at the very least, play down its seriousness. Conservative-lites, for instance, will very vaguely argue that technology and human ingenuity will eventually help us all coast this annoying artifact of progress. Full-fat conservatives will go whole-hog and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-skeptics-want-more-co2/">argue it'll be of net benefit to society</a>.</p><p>On the liberal side they have their own range of cheers. Liberal-lites are very keen on raising taxes on production, which they argue would somehow help cool down the world. Full-fat liberals try to use Climate Change as an argument for going communist, because we all know communist societies won't engage in any industrialised production.</p><p>But both sides merely skirt around the issue when it comes down to it. It's merely one string connected to the levers which make their supporters dance. And it's often used as a more palatable brand to be wrapped like a mask over schemes that try and force action of other, unrelated kinds, that they know would not have broader public appear.</p><h2 id="for-large-orgs-it-s-press-release-porn">For large Orgs, it's press release porn</h2><p>Then there's the giant multinationals and intergovernmental organisations. They love to throw around the words "Climate" or "Environmentally friendly" too. It's excellent press-release porn.</p><p>There's a regular, periodic drip of kumbaya-like statements from these hydras, with vague expressions of their "great concerns" and "action needing to be taken". The young folks loves that shit, right? </p><p>You see, a well-crafted press release is amazing for creating the illusion of action. It's excellent moral insurance cover. "We often spoke about our concerns, with quite a lot of words and various agreeable degrees of sternness."</p><p>Then there's the epic events. Climate Change is a pretty rad reason to organise those. They have them often. Fly a whole bunch of delegates to this expensive venue in that remote country. There's lots of food and freebies, well-lit stages, fancy hotels and banquets. The pamphlets and banners with their tastefully designed artwork make for excellent photo-op backdrops. The world needs to see how much these very important organisations and their people care. </p><p>For-profit organisations also know how to use Climate Change effectively. It's marketing gold - so hot right now! It's a very effective tool to justify asking for more money while giving less in return. Tell your customers it's for the good of the colony! That charger that you now need to buy separately will surely save us all.</p><p>My point is of course that when it comes to Climate Change<em>,</em> the leaders of our societies, even the ones that don't outright deny that it's happening, all shout out slogans, make speeches, and then recede into the shadows of bureaucracy.</p><p>"Showing support" is easy, cheap and keeps the masses content. No serious thought or action is being mustered into how we're <em>actually</em> going to deal with the arrival of this c<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-climate-change-report-human-civilization-at-risk-extinction-by-2050-new-australian-climate/">ivilisation-ending threat</a>. </p><p>Some parts of some governments <em>are</em> actually thinking about it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/24/21145687/climate-change-usa-military-book-interview">like the militaries,</a> but for the rest it's just lip service.</p><p>"COVID!", you might retort, "showed us that governments <em>can</em> take swift and decisive action! So there's hope! We just need to vote more and start grass-roots movements!"</p><p>Well, sure, governments did take action with COVID. But most of them took too little action too late. And let's not even go into the mad-surge of power grabbing that happened - the rights being sacrificed on the altar of Security. Or my own government taking the opportunity to elevate corruption and state-looting to new, ever-refined heights.</p><p>But sure, let's simplify it and just consider the fact that action was taken. The problem is that action was only taken when the sparks began to fly. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response">Action was taken when the viruses were at the gate</a>. Rome had to fall before anyone felt bothered enough to get up.</p><p>Another example of when people collectively decided to take mass action was with the BLM protests. Or the recent electoral battle between the two old men in the US. Magnificent events, for sure. The people made their voices heard. </p><p>But on closer consideration, doesn't it simply add more evidence to my assertion that nobody really believes in Climate Change? It's clearly not deemed important enough to warrant similar such action.</p><p>Well, that's not really true, I guess. </p><p>There was the Climate Change protests in 2019, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes#:~:text=The%20September%202019%20climate%20strikes,place%20from%2020%E2%80%9327%20September.&amp;text=The%2020%20September%20protests%20were,climate%20strikes%20in%20world%20history.">Global Week for Future</a>. Let's be honest though, nothing really came of that. Lot's of noise was made, lots of fun chanting. School was skipped, selfies were taken. Camaraderie was felt, but <em>actual</em> change was as good as being on holiday. And ever so swiftly, with the emergence of the virus shenanigans, Greta &amp; co also faded into the background.</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. They're hard core. Excellent name too, really catchy. Too extreme for mainstream narratives though, too aggressive and offensive. You can't run feel-good stories after covering that lot. The responsible media can't support such hooliganism.</p><p>So I admit, there <em>were</em> social movements trying to rouse society into action, but they lost steam and fizzled out. Not enough traction. Not compelling enough. Just a fad. No product-market fit.</p><p>I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It's a recurring theme when reading some of the comments on Reddit and HackerNews when the weekly Climate horror threads bubble up. Is it hopelessness, disbelief, distant consequences or laziness? </p><p>Because i<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3041/beating-back-the-tides/">t's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109152241.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds">due</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/hurricane-eta-storm-2020-climate-change-b892557.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/arctic-sea-ice-level-climate-change-global-warming-siberia-b1345792.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/russian-scientists-find-powerful-ever-methane-seep-arctic-ocean/">lack</a> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3008/stunning-forecast-a-century-of-ice-loss-for-nearly-100000-glaciers/">of</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">evidence</a>. There's <strong>tons</strong> of evidence that things will unhinge pretty soon, and there has been for years. Never mind the fact that even the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968">oil companies knew what they were doing</a> in the 60s, or that even further <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/how-19th-century-scientists-predicted-global-warming/">back in the 19 century, some had started to suspect that things could get bad</a>. </p><p>Then there was also that fun little controversial book, written ages ago in 1972, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth#Conclusions">The Limits to Growth</a>.

Thrilling stuff. </p><p>Here's a trailer.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCxPOqwCr1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The Limits to Growth caused quite the stir.

This is not necessary, because there've been enough different studies focussing on different aspects of our effect on the environment, and they all seem to come together as pixels of same picture.</p><p>Make no mistake, it sure looks like the apocalypse is coming.

<p>
If you have participated in a discussion about Elixir, you may have heard “you may not need Redis with Elixir”. Given that Redis has many use cases, this sentence may confuse developers as they try to match Elixir’s different features against Redis’ capabilities. This article aims to explore different scenarios where the above is true, when they are not, and which trade-offs you may want to consider. We will discuss four cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<a href="#post-pubsub">Distributed PubSub</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-presence">Presence</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-caching">Caching</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-async">Asynchronous processing</a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Before we start, I want to emphasize we find Redis a fantastic piece of technology. This is not a critique of Redis but rather a discussion of the different options Elixir developers may have available.</p>
<h2 id="post-pubsub">
  Case #1: Distributed PubSub</h2>
<p>
The first scenario where you may not need Redis with Elixir is Distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>. Throughout this section, we will consider PubSub systems to provide <strong>at-most-once delivery</strong>: they broadcast events to the currently available subscribers. If a subscriber is not around, they won’t receive the message later.</p>
<p>
For this reason, PubSub systems are often paired with databases to offer persistence. For example, every time someone sends a message in a chat application, the system can save the contents to the database and then broadcast it to all users. This means everyone connected at a given moment sees the update immediately, but disconnected users can catch up later.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have multiple nodes, and you want to exchange messages between said nodes. In Elixir, thanks to the Erlang VM, which ships with distribution support, this can be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>.</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">{</span><span>:known_name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:hello_world</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub/blob/master/lib/phoenix/pubsub.ex">200LOC or less</a>, you can implement a PubSub system that broadcasts to all subscribers within the same node or anywhere else in a cluster, without bringing any third-party tools. At best, you will need <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster">libcluster</a> - an Elixir library - to establish the connection between the nodes based on some strategy (K8s, AWS, DNS, etc.).</p>
<p>
In other words, PubSub pretty much ships out of the box with Elixir. Technologies without distribution would need to rely on Redis PubSub, PostgreSQL Notifications, or similar to achieve the same.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above assumes your infrastructure allows you to directly establish connections between nodes, which may not be possible in some PaaS, such as Heroku. In those cases, you can use any of the technologies above (Phoenix <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub_redis/">has a Redis adapter</a> for its PubSub), or alternatively use platforms, such as <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, that make it trivial to setup a cluster.</p>
<h2 id="post-presence">
  Case #2: Presence</h2>
<p>
Presence is the ability to track who is connected in a cluster right now — the “who” may be users, phones, IoT devices, etc. For example, if Alice is connected to node A, she wants to see that Bob is also available, even if he has joined node B.</p>
<p>
Presence is one of the problems that are more complicated to implement than it sounds. For example, let’s consider implementing Presence by storing the connected entities in a database. However, what happens if a node crashes or leaves the cluster? Because the node crashed, all the users connected to it must be removed, but the node itself cannot do so. Therefore the other nodes need to detect those failure scenarios and act accordingly. But observing failures in a distributed system is also complicated: how do you differentiate between a temporarily unresponsive node from one that permanently failed?</p>
<p>
Another common approach to solve this problem is to frequently write to a database while users are connected. If you have seen no writes within a timeframe, you consider those users to be disconnected. However, such solutions have to choose between being write-intensive or inaccurate. For instance, let’s say that users become disconnected after 1 minute. This means that you need to write to the database every 1 minute for every user. If you have 10k users, that’s 167 writes per second, only to track that the users are connected. Meanwhile, the gap between a user leaving and having their status reflected in the UI is, in the worst-case scenario, also 1 minute. Any attempt at reducing the number of writes implies an increased gap.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir’s clustering support, we can once more implement <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> without a need for third-party dependencies! We use a PubSub system to implement Presence, as we need to notify as users join and leave. Instead of relying on centralized storage, the nodes directly communicate and exchange information about who is around. This removes the need for frequent writes. When a user leaves, this is also reflected immediately.</p>
<p>
So while you can use Redis or another storage to provide Presence, Elixir can deliver a solution that is efficient and doesn’t require third-party tools.</p>
<h2 id="post-caching">
  Case #3: Caching</h2>
<p>
The solutions to previous cases were built on top of Erlang’s unique distribution capabilities. In the following sections, the distinguishing factor between needing Redis or not will be <strong>multi-core concurrency</strong>, so this discussion is more generally applicable. Therefore, when we say Elixir in this section, it will also apply to JVM, Go, and other environments. They will contrast to Ruby, Python, and Node.js, in which their primary runtimes do not provide adequate multi-core concurrency within a single Operating System process.</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the non-concurrent scenario. Consider you are building a web application in Ruby, Python, etc. To deploy it, you get two eight-core machines. In languages that do not provide satisfactory multi-core concurrency, a common option for deployment is to start 8 instances of your web application, one per core, on each node. Overall, you will have CxN instances, where C is the number of cores, and N is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>
Now consider a particular operation in this application that is expensive, and you want to cache its results. The easiest solution, regardless of your programming environment, is to cache it in memory. However, given we have 16 instances of this application, caching it in memory is suboptimal: we will have to perform this expensive operation at least 16 times, one for each instance. For this reason, it is widespread to use Redis, Memcached, or similar for caching in environments like Ruby, Python, etc. With Redis, you would cache it only once, and it will be shared across all instances. The trade-off is that we are replacing memory access by a network round-trip, and the latter is orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>
Now let’s consider environments with multi-core concurrency. In languages like Elixir, you start one instance per node, regardless of the number of cores, since the runtime will share memory and efficiently spread the work across all cores. When it comes to caching, keeping the cache in-memory is a much more affordable scenario, as you will only have to compute once per node. Therefore, you have the <em>option</em> to skip Redis or Memcached altogether and avoid network round-trip.</p>
<p>
Of course, this depends on how many nodes you are effectively running in production. Luckily, many companies report being able to <a href="https://dev.to/erlangsolutions/why-elixir-is-the-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2020-5g00">run Elixir with an order of magnitude less nodes</a> than technologies they have migrated from.</p>
<p>
You can also choose a mixed approach and store the cache both in-memory and in Redis. First, you look up in memory and, if missing, you fallback to Redis. If unavailable in both, then you execute the operation and cache it in each. The critical part to highlight here is that multi-core environments give you more flexibility to tackle these problems while reducing resource utilization. In Elixir/Erlang, you can also keep the cache in memory and use PubSub to distribute it across nodes. You can see this last approach in action <a href="https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags">in the excellent FunWithFlags library</a>.</p>
<p>
Another trade-off to consider is that all in-memory cache will be gone once you deploy new nodes. Therefore, if you need data to persist across deployments, you will want to use Redis as a cache layer, as detailed above, or dump the cache in a storage, such as database, S3, or Redis, before each deployment.</p>
<h2 id="post-async">
  Case #4: Asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>
Another scenario you may not need Redis in Elixir is to perform asynchronous processing. Let’s continue the discussion from the previous case.</p>
<p>
In environments without or with limited multi-core concurrency, given each instance is assigned to one core, they are limited in their ability to handle requests concurrently. This has led to a common saying that “you should avoid blocking the main thread”. For example, imagine that your application has to deliver emails on sign up or generate some computationally expensive reports. While one of your 16 web instances is doing this, it cannot handle other incoming requests efficiently. For this reason, a common choice here is to move the work elsewhere, typically a background-job processing queue. First, you store the work to be done on Redis or similar. Then one of the 16 web instances (or more commonly a completely different set of workers) grabs it from the queue.</p>
<p>
In multi-core concurrent environments, requests can be handled concurrently regardless if they are doing CPU or IO work. Sending the email from the request itself won’t block other requests. Generating the report is not a problem, as requests can be served by other CPUs. These platforms typically get assigned as many requests as they can handle and they distribute the work over the machine resources. Even if you prefer to deliver emails outside of the request, in order to send an earlier response to users, you can spawn an asynchronous worker without a need to move the delivery to an external queue or to another machine. Once again, concurrency gives us a more straightforward option to tackle these scenarios.</p>

Note the Erlang VM takes care of multiplexing CPU and IO work without a need for developers to tag functions as async or similar. Workers in Erlang/Elixir are …</p></article></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.ungated.media/article/substack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ungated.media/article/substack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>’ll admit, I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>. It’s home to some of the most electrifying writing online, and I happily pay for a few newsletters myself. However, as someone who’s looking to <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/introduction" target="_blank">build a long-term business around my own writing</a>, you couldn’t pay me to use the platform. The cost is too high, in more ways than one.</p><p>The critique that’s coming is going to be brutal. But first, a few acknowledgments, because Substack’s founders have indeed done something extraordinary. They’ve properly aligned the incentives between creators and consumers, unshackled some of the world’s best writing talent, and singlehandedly made the idea of paid newsletters cool again.</p><p>In a media ecosystem increasingly dominated by the loudest, most outrage-driven voices, Substack’s carved out a space where thoughtfulness reigns, and individual creators are rewarded for the depth of their contribution. It’s refreshing, and it gives me a glimmer of hope for the future of indie media.</p><p>Substack also deserves credit for how simple and frictionless their platform is. It’s the only tool I know where you can set up a paid newsletter in the next 20 minutes, even if you’re technologically illiterate. I doubt we’d have seen the explosion in quality writing this year had it not been dead simple to get started.</p><p>However, most of that praise comes from a consumer perspective. As a creator and entrepreneur, I’m perplexed and concerned by Substack’s seemingly endless list of shortcomings. Though it’s incredibly popular right now, I believe it’s important for ambitious creators to understand the downside before staking their claim on Substack.</p><h2>Who do I recommend Substack for?</h2><p>Before we get into the critique, I have to stress that Substack is not a bad piece of software. Though it’s a poor fit for serious creators, there are people who will get amazing value from Substack.</p><p><strong>For starters, it’s the obvious choice for hobbyists.</strong> If you’re looking for a place to write, unencumbered by expensive marketing and website tools with features you’ll never need, go for Substack. It’s free, simple, and so, so easy to maintain. Plus, you can always turn on subscriptions if you want to generate a bit of side income. Just beware, if your intentions shift towards building a business, you’re going have to deal with all of the limitations below.</p><p><strong>I’d also recommend it for creators who value simplicity and ease above all else.</strong> Personally, I enjoy <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/membership-tools" target="_blank">getting into the weeds and finding the perfect tech</a> for the job. I don’t mind a bit of extra complexity if it results in a better business for me, or a richer experience for my fans. But if all you want is to write and get paid, and you don’t have the time or temperament to piece together various tools, go with Substack. I still hope you’ll read the rest of this article, though, because there are very real tradeoffs you’re making with this approach.</p><p><strong>Lastly, I’d recommend it for serious entrepreneurs who are looking to rapidly deploy an MVP for a paid newsletter</strong>. Maybe you’ve got a hypothesis for a newsletter you think would kick ass, but you’re not sure it’d work. Instead of investing the time to build your custom infrastructure up front, you can jump on Substack, publish a bit, do some marketing, and see if your hypothesis holds water or not.</p><p>I’m pretty sure that’s what <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">Rosie Sherry</a> is doing with her Substack. She used it to build a writing habit, validate that people will pay for great community-building content, and is now moving to a better set of tools.</p><figure id="w-node-22162e753f7d-377c2913"></figure><p>Just beware, the longer you stick with Substack, the harder it’s going to be to switch. So I’d recommend using it for a few months at most, then migrating to a set of tools more suited to building a business.</p><p>With all of that said, let’s now get into Substack’s shortcomings for serious creators.</p><h2>A pricing model that penalizes success</h2><p>How much would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? I’m going to keep coming back to this simple question throughout the article. So keep it top of mind.</p><p>Substack, of course, is free to start. Only once you monetize do they take a flat 10% out of your earnings. (And hey, if you never charge, you’ve essentially got a forever-free newsletter/blog hybrid.)</p><p>Assuming you’re just getting started with subscription media, this is an <em>amazing</em> deal. You get full access to a platform that would likely cost $30-100/month were it priced as a traditional SaaS tool. And you never pay anything close to that in fees until you’re bringing in real money. </p><p>This is part of what makes Substack so seductive. It’s not only easy to get started, but it comes with the veneer of being a great bargain.</p><p>However, as you start growing a genuine business around your content, and that 10% creeps ever higher, it becomes less obvious what value you’re getting in return for Substack’s fee.</p><p>Here are a few examples that demonstrate this well.</p><p>When I first started planning Ungated, I briefly considered building on Substack. After all, that’s where all the cool kids were writing. Then I started doing the math.</p><p>The plan was (and still is) to build a $10/month publication, and within a year, have 1000 happy customers. Yep, a year from now, I plan to be living the Kevin Kelly dream.</p><p>That’s $120,000/year in top line revenue. Of that, Substack’s take would be $12,000 annually, or $1,000 a month. (Keep in mind, this is simplified math that doesn’t take into account the additional 2.9% + 30¢ from Stripe.)</p><p>That hypothetical $12K annual fee—how does it strike you? Does it feel like a fair exchange of value with Substack? Are you getting your money’s worth?</p><p>For me, the answer was a clear and unambiguous <em>hell no</em>. And you’ll see why as you move through the rest of this post.</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch, and use another real life example to drive home the point.</p><p>As of this writing, <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank">Matt Taibbi</a> has the third most popular paid newsletter on Substack’s leaderboard, with “tens of thousands” of subscribers. Now, by all accounts, Matt’s super happy with Substack, so this’ll be hypothetical. But it’s instructive nonetheless.</p><p>For the sake of easy math, let’s say he’s got 15,000 paid subscribers at $50/year. That translates to roughly $750,000 per year, without yet accounting for fees or churn or new subscribers.</p><p>That means, unless Substack cut him some kind of deal (which they’ve been known to do with high-profile journalists), Matt Taibbi’s singlehandedly paying $75,000 a year in fees.</p><p>Can we let that sink in for a moment? </p><p>That’s a year of tuition, room, and board at Yale University. That’s a middle manager’s yearly salary. That’s a brand new Tesla Model S. That’s an entry-level house in Detroit. Hell, that’s a full time employee—or several contractors—Matt could hire to help grow his media business (which he recently <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/note-to-readers-6ea" target="_blank">expressed interest</a> in doing.)</p><p>Broken down, that’s $6,250 per month in fees. If Matt posts twice per week, he’s essentially paying Substack $781.25 every single time he publishes.</p><p>For what?</p><blockquote>Is Substack, as a platform, delivering a fraction of that much value on an ongoing basis? Sure, it’s easy and low-maintenance, but how much are those things truly worth? At what point are you flushing money—that you’ve rightfully earned by delivering value to your fans—down the toilet?</blockquote><p>Again, I would like you to consider the question: what would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? $50 a month? $100 a month?</p><p>In 2020 as I write this, the market for “passion economy” software is exploding. Anyone can now piece together an email, membership, and website tech stack that is <em>far more capable</em> than Substack, and only pay $15-200/month. </p><p>For the creators who succeed on its platform, Substack really has to deliver something above and beyond to justify taking 10% in perpetuity. And I don’t see much evidence of that.</p><p>In fact, as we’re about to see, the sky-high fee is just the tip of a very depressing iceberg.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>After chatting with someone at Substack, it seems they do offer ongoing benefits to their higher-earning creators. It just isn’t advertised anywhere. Those benefits include things like health care, legal defense if you get sued, and design/marketing help, which are indeed hugely valuable. I’d hope for more transparency from Substack as to how creators can qualify for any of this, because right now, it’s very unclear.</em></p><h2>In a world that rewards uniqueness and personality, Substack forces sameness</h2><p>I’m subscribed to roughly eleventy thousand Substack newsletters. That number has actually grown since I started writing this article. I’ve clearly got an addiction, and someone should stage an intervention ASAP.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f5306248ae8615a2f258509/5f90860691026f7b7be523dd_HugeThoughtfulKagu-size_restricted.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Jokes aside, the moment you subscribe to more than a handful of Substack newsletters, you’ll notice something rather alarming—they all start to blend together. </p><p>They all look and feel the same. The user experience is the same (and not very good, as I’ll detail later). And hell, the content itself is even starting to blur together, given that it’s mostly tech/media/politics folks on the platform.</p><p>Even the strongest, most thoughtful writers start blending in with one another, as they have almost no discernible brand. And in a landscape with more people becoming indie creators each day, that is a seismic fucking problem.</p><p>Let’s back up a moment.</p><blockquote>One of the core principles of succeeding in the modern creator economy is that your work needs to be <em>genuinely worthy of people’s attention</em>. We live in a world of media abundance, and if you want to be seen as signal in the noise, you need to be different or better in some way.</blockquote><p>A big part of that is honing in on a specific niche, or finding your “personal monopoly” as <a href="https://www.perell.com/" target="_blank">David Perell</a> would say. </p><figure id="w-node-0922ad6c2b70-377c2913"></figure><p>But another, equally important part is finding ways to inject your personality, values, and aesthetic sensibilities into everything you do. In other words, it’s about having a unique, discernible brand.</p><p>On Substack, you can kiss that possibility goodbye from day one.</p><p>In fact, Substack gives you so little control over your design and brand that it’s actually a bit comical. You get the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  </header>
  <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts/">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>

<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>

<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>

<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to get started</li>
  <li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
  <li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>

<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>

<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>

<p>When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>

<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>

<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>

<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>

<p>With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>

<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>

<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
  <li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
  <li>Slow iteration speed</li>
  <li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
  <li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
  <li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>

<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>

<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>

<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conventions</li>
  <li>Tooling, libraries</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
  <li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
  <li>Have to host on a server</li>
  <li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Concords is an MVP framework for building offline &amp; decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.</p> <p>The full MVP is available to try at <a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alpha.concords.app</a></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>SAAS applications run on servers with databases. Each interaction with the UI sends information from the browser to a server, which then likely writes something or fetches something from a centralized database.</p> <p>Maintaining servers and databases is expensive, complex and time-consuming and I'm not really interested in that side of software. I don't want the responsibility to look after data that is depended upon, that's neither my skill-set nor passion. I like to focus my attention on the front-end experience.</p> <p>I set out to build a framework for file-based SAAS apps. Multi-user collaborative apps, with data-driven user flows and advanced UI. But apps that run offline and save state to the filesystem, not send it off to a cloud-based database. Giving users full ownership and visibility of their data, with no dependency on an internet connection. Taking a progressive approach to connectivity, using it to enrich the experience, but not depend on it.</p> <h2 id="technical-steps">Technical Steps</h2> <ul> <li><p>Functional blockchain library in Typescript.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Svelte</a> &amp; <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sapper</a> for all things UI.</p> </li> <li><p>Blockchain sync with IndexedDB and reactivity hook.</p> </li> <li><p>Created <a href="https://1.0.0.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some mini-apps</a> to refine and test the core functionality.</p> </li> <li><p>User Authentication flow.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MVP: Kanban app</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="concords-mvp-board-app">Concords MVP: Board App</h2> <p>This MVP serves to demonstrate a basic solution to a truly offline and decentralized experience in a collaborative web app. It's a static app, so just Javascript and HTML, with no servers or databases running in the background. It's a progressive web app with a service worker, that runs entirely in the browser. So once the initial load has been performed, the rest of the experience can work completely offline, where data is stored in files, downloaded and uploaded through the UI.</p> <p>A boards app covers a lot of functionality commonly found in SAAS applications, I figured it's a great benchmark to prove out the technology.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/add-task.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>With Concords, authentication is all done in the browser, without any communication to a server or external resource.</p> <p>In the Concords authentication system, we issue a downloadable public profile which includes your public key and some basic user info. I keep mine for the MVP on my personal domain. <a href="https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json</a></p> <p>Anyone with access to my public key is able to encrypt data for me, that only I can read with my private key. I just have that stored on my personal machine. It’s never been online and no-one else knows it.</p> <p>This key is used to log the user into the app and only a valid key combination can login and access the software.</p> <p>For my MVP, this is more than sufficient to complete and decent authentication flow. We can have a recognisable UX of profile/password combination to build a login system, whilst setting us up for an encrypted, multi-user, data flow.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/signup.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <p>I know it's a pain to ask users to store both parts of their encryption keys themselves. If the private key is lost, it's unrecoverable and so is any encrypted data to that key. But I couldn't compromise here, it has to be this way to keep things decentralized. But it's a problem that can be fixed through software, it doesn't have to be my software - we're decentralizing things here, but key management software will fix this problem.</p> <h3 id="the-app">The App</h3> <p>Knowing roughly what I needed to build to prove out the concept, and having already implemented User Profile and the authentication flow, the key features I chose to implement were:</p> <ul> <li>Create new and multiple boards</li> <li>Downloadable app files</li> <li>Load any board, from any user</li> <li>Assign tasks to users</li> <li>Editable tasks</li> <li>Timestamped actions</li> <li>Drag to sort columns</li> <li>Draggable tasks across columns</li> <li>Soft delete tasks to the trash, with restore and remove</li> <li>Activity log with an immutable history of the board</li> </ul> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/create-board.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h4> <p>By default, a new user doesn't have edit access to a document. For the purpose of the MVP, we've got a "Join" button in the left-hand sidebar. Clicking this will add the user as an entry to the data store and unlock editing. This covers the concept enough for now, but we are able to achieve direct encryption with the public/private key authentication, so that's going to be an interesting avenue to explore further outside of the MVP context.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/third-user.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3> <p>The core of the framework is written in Typescript. It's a collection of functional utilities which cover the data side of the application. It runs an internal blockchain for writing data, mapped with an IndexDB instance for reading.</p> <h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4> <p>At the heart of the library is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/merkle-tree-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-8m2a63xjd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Merkel Tree</a> solution. Our Merkle Tree (as used in Blockchain and git), is a functional library to act as a blockchain node, from a JSON object structure, in the browser.</p> <p>Built on top of that is a CRUD API which the application will interface with. When an action is performed in the app, a timestamped transaction is created for the blockchain. Once commit, all pending transactions are then added to a block on the chain. Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the hash-based data structure ensures the integrity of the app state.</p> <pre><code>{

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my Amiga, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>07 Nov 2020</span></p><p>The purpose of this serie is to review some parts of the <em>CPython</em>’s code.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Well there are multiple reasons :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because we can. The project is opensource and the source code is freely available here : <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">https://github.com/python/cpython</a></li>
  <li>I strongly believe that we, as developpers, can learn a lot by studying good and clean code. And I think we can safely assume that CPython’s code, which is used practicaly everywhere, meet this crietria.</li>
  <li>I also think that studying python internals can make us better python programmers, for example ever wondered why changing <em>sys.stdout</em> seems to have no effect on subprocesses ? Well at the end of this article You will know why.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to regulary realease articles  on random functions/modules/data strucutres/algorithms.</p>

<p>Starting today I don’t really have a plan or a timeline for future articles, I’ll just start with <em>subprocess.Popen</em> and go from there.</p>

<p>I’ll try to link PEPs, articles and disscussions whenever I can.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER : I am not a Python Core Developper, therefore a lot of claims that I’ll make here may be wrong, especially if they’re not backed by any evidence.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s read some code !</p>

<h2 id="wait--what-the-heck-is-cpython-">Wait … What the heck is CPython ?</h2>

<p><em>CPython</em> is the official python implementation. You need to understand that there is a difference between python specification and a python implementation.</p>

<p>A simple example can be the sorting function :</p>

<p>The python specification specify that a valid implementation should offer a <code>sorted</code> function which can take a list and sort it.</p>

<p>But as you may recall from your painfull algorithms course, there are multiple sorting algorithms, so which one are being used ? Well, as a lot of things, it depends on the implementation.</p>

<p>In fact you can create your own implementation and use bubble sort if you want, not a very practical choice but you can !</p>

<p><em>CPython</em> is widely used nowadays, and a lot of its code is wrote using C, again this is an implementation detail not a specification one.</p>

<p>There are other python implementations like <em>PyPy</em> (which use JIT compilation), or <em>Jython</em> which is ran on a JVM machine.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>

<p>the first step is to get the cpython code. For that we gonna just clone the official repo on github :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="subprocesspopen--the-class">Subprocess.Popen : The class</h2>

<p>Please note that we won’t really analyze ALL the code of <em>Popen</em>, there are way too many options and use cases to fit in this article.</p>

<p>Instead we juste gonna try to understand what happens when you execute this line of code :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'ls'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-l'</span><span>])</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>We need to find a starting point, we can simply do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>find <span>-name</span> subprocess.py 

./Lib/asyncio/subprocess.py
./Lib/subprocess.py</code></pre></figure>

<p>we can safely assume that the module we’re searching for is <code>Lib/subprocess</code>.</p>

<p>By searching for <code>Popen</code> in the file we find a class :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Popen</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>""" Execute a child program in a new process.

    For a complete description of the arguments see the Python documentation.

    Arguments:
      args: A string, or a sequence of program arguments.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first instruction is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_child_created</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>  <span># Set here since __del__ checks it</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the <code>__del__</code> is basicaly a destructor method in python, this method is automatically called when the garbage collector try to free the object.</p>

<p>in CPython the garbage collector use what we call <em>reference counting</em>, this means that if you write something like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> 

<span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span># we affect a new list to a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the second line we no longer have a reference to the list <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, which means that the garbage collector may delete it (or not) any time.</p>

<p>my guess, is that if you run a command like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'my command'</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>since you’re not referencing the Popen object, it is a <em>garbage candidate</em>, and the gc may try to delete it before it run. Which is not the excepected behaviour since you except the command to run even if you don’t care about what it’ll return.</p>

<p>What surprises me tough is the fact that it’s a class attribute, there is surely a reason behind it, but i’m not sure what.</p>

<p>After doing a <code>git blame</code>, we can see that it was actually an instance attribute before this commit <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156">72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156</a>. Which refers to this issue : <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue12085">issue12085</a>.</p>

<p>And the explanation is as follow :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If subprocess.Popen is called with a keyword argument whose name is undefined or simply too many arguments, an instance of the Popen class is created but its __init__ method call fails due to the invalid argument list. (Immediately) afterwards, the new instance is destroyed and its __del__ method is called, which checks the _child_created field that is defined by __init__; but __init__ never got the chance to execute, so the field is not defined, and __del__ raises an AttributeError, which is written out to stderr.</p>

  <p>- Oleg Oshmyan (chortos) [2011]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-__init__-method">The <code>__init__</code> method</h2>

<p>the first instruction in the init method is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_cleanup</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>from the comment it looks like the purpose of the function is to avoid zombie processes. one thing that i like about this function is how the autor of the except explictly explain why he passes when he catches a ValueError and why it’s okay. I see a lot of developpers using the pattern <code>try: except (some exception or just Exception) pass</code> instead of treating the error proply. This can be very risky as it may hide a real error that you wish you saw before wasting 2 days trying to debug a random issue.</p>

<p>After that we can see some basic parameters validation : like <em>is bufsize an integer</em> ?</p>

<p>This is also a very good habit to have, especialy in a dynamicaly typed language like Python.</p>

<p>your code may still work with the wrong types and give you a wrong result, as an example :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>list_str</span><span>):</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>list_str</span><span>]</span>

<span>to_upper</span><span>([</span><span>'aaa'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bbb'</span><span>])</span> <span># ['AAA', 'BBB']
</span><span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>'ab'</span><span>)</span> <span># ['A', 'B']</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see altough it works, example 2 is clearly not what the user would expect.</p>

<p>You can also start to see that some code parts depends on the target plateforme (windows / POSIX), for the rest of this article, I’ll focus on the POSIX part.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>(</span><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_get_handles</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>,</span> <span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>stderr</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>next we get the <em>file decriptors</em> related to the optional arguments stdin/stdout/stderr.</p>

<p>A file descriptor is an abstraction managed by the process, each file descriptor points to an entry in a system wide table called <em>Open file table</em>.</p>

<p>In python you can do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"my file"</span><span>).</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will return the file descriptor.</p>

<p>Based on the comments and common sense it looks like, we will not always need 6 file descriptors, but only if we choose to communicate with the child process (which is not our case for our example).</p>

<p>In our example it looks like : <code>c2pwrite</code> will be the fd of the output of our script (1 if stdout) and <code>p2cread</code> the fd of the input of our script (0 if stdin).</p>

<p>In the <code>_get_handles</code> function :</p>

<p>looks like the default values (if no alternative stdout/in/err) is provided) : -1.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>

 
<span>if</span> <span>stdin</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span>

<span>if</span> <span>stdout</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the function seems to confirm our hypothesis :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>else</span><span>:</span>
	<span># Assuming file-like object
</span>	<span>p2cread</span> <span>=</span> <span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span>

<p>it does bug me how similar the stdin / stdout / stderr code is. I know if I had to write this code I will desperatly try to somehow refactore it in one block, I’m not sure tough if it will be a good idea, refactoring is not always a good thing.</p>

<p>if the <code>_USE_POSIX_SPAWN</code> is true, python will try to use it to create the child process.</p>

<p>that if you are on a linux plateform and the version of <em>glibc</em> is greater than <em>2.24</em> you ll use <code>posix_spanw()</code>.</p>

<p>the 2.24 version of glibc has been released around 2016 so it’s fair to assume that if you have a recent linux distribution you ll also use <code>posix_spawn()</code>.</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

<figure>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Lazy Loading Explained]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>set</span> <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING AND RETURNING IMAGE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

<p>This is a tiny lesson in design I learned at Freshworks. The lesson seems obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t so obvious when we were making the mistake.</p>



<p>So, <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Freshdesk</a> is used by customer support teams day in and day out. When these teams log in to Freshdesk, we show them conversations their users had sent in over email, Twitter, Facebook, etc – in one place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These customer support teams can pick between two different views to see these conversations when reading them on Freshdesk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One view was called the <strong>card view</strong>. The card view is quite similar to how emails appear today in mobile Gmail. It was the default, and it looked like this:</p>

<p>When we got on calls with teams that used Freshdesk, we were surprised that they hadn’t discovered table view until we told them about it.</p>



<p>A person actually told us that the icon we had used to represent the table view was too small, and it appeared like a calculator and not actually a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first time I heard it – I’ll be honest, I chuckled. Then, I went back and thought about it and felt he was totally right. We had all sorts of icons (with <strong>no</strong> supplemental text) that made no sense to our customers. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>That’s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>when I learned a design lesson that I carry in my heart till day.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s muscle memory recognises the icons for ‘Save’, ‘Delete’ and ‘New’ as ‘something that looks like a floppy’, ‘a bin’ or ‘a plus’, respectively. And they know what these icons convey in the apps they’re seeing them on.</p>



<p>But the products we’re building these days have more than just these universally recognized actions. Brand new icons you may be using to represent these actions aren’t part of anyone’s muscle memory (like the floppy or bin icons).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your product has a button to let sales people change the deal stage, it cannot be just an icon. It’s got to be supplemented with text. </p>



<p>If you’re building a feature where you’re taking people to a ‘focus mode’ to do some intense work using a button, you can’t have just an icon to represent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, your designers and product team might love having just icons to represent these actions to save space but your users will:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. end up rarely noticing the icon if it’s not a frequent action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. when it’s a frequent action, they’ll click on the icon,&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. realise they clicked on the wrong one,</p>



<p>4. then go on a trip to find what they actually want to click on,</p>



<p>5. then click on the right one after some retries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It just doesn’t work when someone says “we can just use an icon and get rid of the text to save some space in the screen.”</strong> By doing that, you’re not saving space – you’re actually causing a usability problem that your customer base will run into hundreds or thousands of times a day.</p>



<p><strong>So, here’s the bottomline:</strong></p>



<p>More often than not, content eats icons for breakfast. Any action that’s <strong>not universal</strong> like ‘save’, ‘new’ or ‘delete’ <strong>must include text.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>By doing this, you actually eliminate the thinking required by your users every time they’re trying to click on that button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have 1000 users, and on average, if one user does an action that’s represented by only an icon 10 times a day, that’s 10,000 confused and unsure clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten thousand literal moments everyday when people are spending a few seconds to figure out if they’re clicking on the right button or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate those 10k*2 seconds = 5 hours by just adding relevant text to those icons 🙂</p>



<p><strong>You’re not just saving those 10 seconds, you’re saving customers from feeling stupid, which they should never feel when using your products anyway 🙂</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

										                <p><em>A superresolution image of a group of killer T-cells (green and red) surrounding a cancer cell (blue, centre). Image: US NIH.</em></p>
<p>On World Cancer Day this year, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, known in India for its cancer care facilities, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece">announced</a> that it would study the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02161900">effects of yoga</a> on breast cancer patients. While the association between <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/regular-exercise-helps-patients-combat-cancer-67317">exercise and recovery</a> in cancer patients has been known since the 1990s, we know little about how this works on a molecular level.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59996">new study</a> shows that the key might lie in activating certain immune cells. The study, conducted by Randall Johnson and his team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Cambridge, was the culmination of three years of research on what makes exercise good for cancer patients.</p>


<p>They first established that exercise could indeed decrease the growth of tumours. They induced tumours in mice, mimicking breast cancer in humans, and separated them into two groups: one exercised on running wheels and one did not. After a few days, the tumours had shrunk in the group that exercised but not in the sedentary group.</p>
<p>When the researchers examined blood samples from the mice, two things had dramatically increased after exercise: immune cells known as CD8+ T-cells and a compound called lactic acid.</p>
<p>The team first looked into CD8+ T-cells, which <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/the-ever-expanding-t-cell-world-a-primer-31123">defend against</a> tumours and infections. Did increased levels after exercise mean that the cells were involved in reducing tumour growth? To test this, the team removed CD8+ T-cells from tumour-bearing mice and then made them exercise. This time, exercising could not shrink the tumours: removing the T-cells also removed the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>“Then we did what, to my mind, is the coolest experiment in the paper,” said Johnson. They made mice exercise, carefully took CD8+ T-cells from them, and transplanted the cells into another set of mice that had tumours but didn’t exercise. To the scientists’ delight, simply transplanting CD8+ T-cells from mice that had exercised could shrink tumours in sedentary mice.</p>
<p>“The T-cells themselves are coming in ‘trained,’ making them better anti-tumour T-cells,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>What was ‘training’ the T-cells, though? That’s when the team turned their attention to lactic acid. After an intense bout of exercise, lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel like they’re burning. In the bloodstream, it circulates as lactate, its ionic form.</p>
<p>To mimic this form and the levels attained after exercise, the researchers injected sodium lactate into sedentary mice that had tumours. As with the T-cells, they found that daily injections of sodium lactate could shrink tumours and improve survival in these mice.</p>
<p>The team now knew that, through exercise, both lactate and CD8+ T-cells could reduce tumour growth. But this still didn’t explain how the two effects were linked.</p>
<p>To answer this, the scientists first checked whether lactate could independently activate CD8+ T-cells – and found that it could. Next, they again injected mice with lactate, only this time they removed the CD8+ T-cells from the mice. Without the T-cells, lactate injections could no longer lessen tumour growth.</p>
<p>“This shows that it’s really the lactate affecting the T-cells and helping them achieve a better anti-tumour effect,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/why-everyone-around-you-seems-to-be-getting-cancer/">Why Everyone Around You Seems to Be Getting Cancer</a></ins></p>
<p>The study fills an important gap in our understanding of how exercise and the related metabolite changes boost anti-tumour the activities of our immune cells.</p>
<p>This said, “My main concern is that people should not think that only exercise can cure cancer,” S.V. Chiplunkar, a former director of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Mumbai, and current head of its Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy division, cautioned.</p>
<p>“A combination of immunotherapy with supervised exercise or yoga regimens may yield significant benefits, but this needs to be tested in a randomised clinical trial.” Chiplunkar wasn’t involved in the study.</p>
<p>And as with any good study, this one spawned more questions than it answered. “Future studies should address how lactate levels are modulated in cancer patients/mice models in response [to] exercise,” Rajender Motiani, an assistant professor and DBT/Wellcome Trust India fellow at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, said.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0485-4">recent study</a> in elite athletes showed that lactate is utilised by a unique class of gut microbiome, enhancing endurance and performance. It would be worth examining gut microbiota changes in cancer patients in response to exercise.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s team is now working out how much exercise is needed to boost T-cell activity. For example, one question they’re asking is if one hour of intense exercise could be better than two hours of light exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helene Rundqvist, the study’s lead author, has been involved in a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02522260?term=exercise&amp;cond=Breast+Cancer&amp;cntry=SE&amp;city=Stockholm&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">clinical trial</a> assessing the effects of exercise on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The trial is still active and expected to be completed in 2022.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Django framework for building python server applications has been around since forever and I believe that the reason for this is the speed at which you can develop apps without compromising on robustness.<br></p><p>To gauge the usefulness of any backend framework, a great litmus test is to see how easy it is to plug in a database to your application and expose the database models to the client via 4 operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br></p><p>This functionality solves a big chunk of your problems, especially if you are building a product that is more front-end heavy and you want to spend as little bandwidth as possible on building your APIs.<br></p><h3><strong>What is CRUD?</strong><br></h3><p>An application server is nothing but a layer on top of a database which provides the ability for a client application to perform the following underlying operations.<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Create a new entry into a table in the database.</li><li>Read the database table entries either by fetching a list of all entries or retrieving the details of a single entry.</li><li>Update an existing entry in the database either by changing certain details or by replacing it entirely with a new one.</li><li>Delete a database table entry either by removing it from the database or by simply marking it as deleted and deactivating it.<br></li></ol><p>Django has ways of doing all of this right out of the box, but I prefer to use a framework written on top of Django called the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a> which makes things even simpler by providing an intuitive interface to the developers. <br></p><h3><strong>A sample CRUD application</strong><br></h3><div><p>I write all my blog posts on the apple notes app before I edit and publish them and it occurred to me that a note taking app is a great way to <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/django-crud-example" target="_blank">demonstrate a CRUD application</a>. </p></div><figure id="w-node-bc04fc2d279c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5faf5796ca5e3a5dd77c5b41_XEHsDH39C2XuP7jH2D_R7hv6wYs8ZGIBkCij0NWiAXStAOuzeIqG61JLp52DNELlsmxqfuMj33tIE-0YsgTIIIDeskVcpRMarPKJKsNA4O2rBoMIFmgahW8Vo2J0YCLZqBsym1Mb.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A note taking app that we will build using Django and Django Rest Framework</figcaption></figure><p>To build an application like this, we need a database table that stores a list of notes consisting of a Title, Content and the last updated timestamp. The notes are sorted according to the last updated timestamp.</p><p>To build this application we need the following functions:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>Creating a new note with an empty title and content.</li><li>Updating the newly created note with a title and content.</li><li>Reading the fields of a note.</li><li>Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.</li><li>Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.</li><li>Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.</li></ol><p>I&nbsp;will be going through all the steps involved in creating this application, but first let's start with the basics.</p><h3>Setting up a Django project</h3><p>There is some basic boilerplate code involved in building any Django application. Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4608430843265935994">
<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>

        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <h2 id="money-vs-time"><a href="#money-vs-time">Money vs Time</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Always ask: Why am I doing this, What is the goal? Why will I succeed? What will happen if I don't do it?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>It's more important to do the right things, rather than do things right.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pareto Principle, 80/20 rule. Focus on the high value/impact things.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>People asked Walt how he built Disneyland in 366 days. His reply: "We used every one of them."</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Planning is impt</strong>. Failing to plan = planning to fail. Have a plan for day/week/quarter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can still be fluid - plans can change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Todos</strong> - Break things down into small steps. "Get tenure" is not a todo. Eat your frog - do the ugliest thing first.</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Prioritization</strong> (MOST IMPORTANT) Covey/Eisenhower Matrix</p>
      <ul>
        <li>urgent + important</li>
        <li>not urgent + important</li>
        <li>urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>not urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>the trick is to not do unimportant things, and to tackle important things <strong>before</strong> they become urgent.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>
      <p>Keep your desk clear - have 1 thing on your desk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Touch each piece of paper, email once. <strong>Inbox is not your todo list</strong>. File the email away and put it on your todo list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A filing system is absolutely essential. Have one place in the house where any piece of paper goes. (Ditto in the cloud/computer)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Have at least two, maybe three monitors.</strong> Using just one "is like eating off the airplane tray."</p>

      <p>Productivity Stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Todolist</li>
        <li>Inbox</li>
        <li>Calendar. Dont use your brain to remember your appointments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Standing during phone calls - will be much faster. Don't get comfortable. "I'd love to keep talking with you but I have students waiting."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Exercise on bike - can be spent on phone if you have a headset</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a Thank You note. Tangible way of telling someone you appreciated something. It makes you rare, they remember you well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The dog - reminds you you have better things to do</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Chair - make your office comfortable for you, optionally comfortable for others (eg folding chair).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You do not find time to do something, you make time.</strong> And you make time by electing not to do something else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Learn to say no.</strong> Opportunity cost is real. "Gentle no" = "I'll be your backup". "If you need an 8th person I'll be there."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your creative time and defend it ruthlessly. It varies for people - could be 10pm-Midnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your dead time and do stuff where you don't need to be at your best.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Interruption</strong> takes 6-9mins, but recovery takes 4-5mins. Got to find ways to reduce frequency of interruptions. Turn phone calls into emails. Batch interactions with other people.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Giving hints to cut meetings short: Get up, walk to the door, thank them, shake their hand. Walk them out of the room.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time journals</strong> - monitor and update thru the day. <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/News/VirtuousReality/">Fred Brooks had actual time clocks</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Look at open blocks where you know you are going to be wasting time, as gaps between blocks - make up a fake class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Delegate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>"How am I wasting other people's time?"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You become more efficient at work so you can leave on time and spend it with the people you love. Once you have kids the stakes are real.</p>

    <li>Sometimes you want to avoid Parkinson's Law - Work expands to fill the time available for it.</li>
    <li>But key realization - doing things at the last minute is very expensive. If you push things up to the deadline that's where all the stress comes from</li>
    <li>Make a fake deadline and pretend it is real.</li>
    <li>Identify why you're procrastinating - afraid you are going to fail? scared to ask somebody for something? Sometimes you just have to ask.</li>

        <li>Specific date/time</li>
        <li>Specific penalty/reward</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Challenge people: delegate until they complain</li>
    <li>Communication has to be CLEAR - and written</li>
    <li>Don't tell them HOW to do it - tell them what you need done, let them come up with solutions. This is how to work with people smarter than you.</li>
    <li>Offer relative importance - so people know what order to do them in</li>
    <li>Beware upward delegation - step back.</li>
    <li>Carrots &gt; Sticks. Reinforce behavior you like. "Thank you I really appreciate you did a good job."</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>
